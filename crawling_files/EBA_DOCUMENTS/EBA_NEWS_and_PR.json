The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its revised Guidelines on the stress tests conducted by national DGSs under the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD). The revised Guidelines extend the scope of the DGS stress testing, by requiring more tests in comparison with the past Guidelines and by covering all the legal missions entrusted to the DGSs. The revisions aim to consolidate depositors\u2019 confidence about the ability of their national DGS(s) to promptly repay their funds in case of banking failure. The revised framework also strives to achieve greater harmonisation and comparability of stress test results, which will enable the EBA to carry out a robust peer review of national DGS stress tests in 2025. The revised EBA Guidelines require DGSs to stress test their ability to perform all the interventions allowed under their legal mandates, and to access all of their funding sources. The cooperation between DGSs and other authorities is also strengthened, by requiring DGSs to stress test scenarios where such cooperation is necessary. In addition, the new provisions encourage the DGSs to stress test scenarios with additional business continuity challenges, such as a pandemic, ICT failures or other similar events. The revisions of the Guidelines are based on the findings of the first EBA peer review of the DGS stress tests and resilience of national DGSs, which the EBA published in a report in June 2020, where it provided early indications of areas in which the DGS stress testing framework could be improved. Legal basis\u00a0 These Guidelines have been developed according to Articles 16(2), 26(1) and 26(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (EBA Regulation). The Guidelines aim at enhancing the framework applicable to the stress tests that the DGSs are required to conduct in compliance with Article 4(10) of the DGSD.

The Guidelines aim to support competent authorities in their assessment of the breaches of the large exposure limits set in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), and ensure the Regulation is applied in a prudent and harmonised manner - while keeping the approach simple -\u00a0which ultimately, leads to a level playing field across the Single Market. In the exceptional case that an institution breaches the large exposure limits, the CRR requires the institution to report the value of the exposure without delay to the competent authority. Where the circumstances warrant it, the institution is granted a limited period of time to comply with such limits. The purpose of these Guidelines is to provide guiding principles based on pre-defined criteria to help competent authorities decide on whether the exceptional circumstances leading to a breach of the large exposure limits would justify the decision to grant a limited period of time to the institution in order to comply with the limit. The Guidelines also provide criteria for competent authorities to determine the appropriate period of time as well as the specific measures to be taken for an institution to return to compliance with the large exposure limits. Legal basis, background and next steps The EBA has developed the final Guidelines in accordance with Article 395(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Article 16 of its founding Regulation, which mandates the Authority to issue guidelines and recommendations addressed to competent authorities or financial institutions with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the European System of Financial Supervision, and to ensuring the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law. The final guidelines were consulted for three months during which the EBA received feedback from stakeholders, leading to some minor amendments compared to the initial proposal. The guidelines will apply from 1 January 2022.

The report highlights the increasing vulnerabilities across the financial sector, the rise seen in terms of cyber risk and the materialisation of event-driven risks. As the recovery begins, the appropriate phasing out of exceptional crisis measures plays a key role. Despite the positive outlook, the expectations for economic recovery remain uncertain and uneven across member states. Vulnerabilities in the financial sector are increasing, not least because of side effects of the crisis measures, such as increasing debt levels and upward pressure on asset prices. Expectations of inflation- and yield growth, as well as increased investor risk-taking and financial interconnectedness issues, might put additional pressure on the financial system. The financial sector is also increasingly exposed to cyber risk. The financial sector has been hit by cyber-attacks more often than other sectors, while across the digital economy, cyber-criminals are developing new techniques to exploit vulnerabilities. Financial institutions will have to rapidly adapt their technical infrastructure in response to the pandemic, and the crisis has acted as a catalyst for digital transformation more generally. Finally, the materialisation of event-driven risks (such as GameStop, Archegos, Greensill), as well as rising prices and volumes traded on crypto-assets, raise questions about increased risk-taking behaviour and possible market exuberance. Concerns about the sustainability of current market valuations remain, and current trends need to show resilience over an extended period of time for a more positive risk assessment. In light of the above-mentioned risks and uncertainties, the ESAs advise national competent authorities, financial institutions and market participants to take the following policy actions: financial institutions and supervisors should continue to be prepared for a possible deterioration of asset quality in the financial sector, notwithstanding the improved economic outlook; as the economic environment gradually improves, the focus should shift to allow a proper assessment of the consequences of the pandemic on banks\u2019 lending books, and banks should adequately manage the transition towards the recovery phase; disorderly increases in yields and sudden reversals of risk premia should be closely monitored in terms of their impacts for financial institutions as well as for investors; financial institutions and supervisors should continue to carefully manage their ICT and cyber risks. The ESAs also consider that policymakers, regulators, financial institutions and supervisors can start reflecting on lessons learnt from the COVID-19 crisis. Notes to editors The Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the ESAs. Under the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board.

The results of the funding plans assessment show the impact the pandemic had on EU banks\u2019 funding composition. The plans point to a gradual \u2018normalisation\u2019 of banks\u2019 sources of funding over the next three years. This implies in particular a partial replacement of central bank funding with market-based funding. 160 banks submitted their funding plans for a forecast period of three years (2021 to 2023). Banks\u2019 total assets increased by 8% in 2020, mainly driven by a surge in cash balances at central banks because of central bank support measures introduced in response to the pandemic. While loan growth was sluggish in 2020, banks expect loans to non-financial corporates (NFCs) and to households to grow by 4% per year over the forecast period 2021 - 2023. In 2020, client deposits surged and by the end of the year represented 73% of banks\u2019 total funding sources. Banks\u2019 reliance on public sector sources of funding (such as the ECB\u2019s TLTRO programme) increased significantly, and as of December 2020 contributed almost 7% to banks\u2019 total funding. While deposits will continue to be the main source of funding, banks plan to focus on issuing more debt instruments (mostly unsecured instruments) in the coming years, to make up for an expected decline in central bank funding but equally to comply with MREL requirements. Data also shows that the spread between interest rates for client deposits and for loans to clients declined in 2020 and is expected to decline further in 2021. Despite the market turbulence in the first half of 2020, banks reported a decline in their market-based funding costs in 2020. In 2021, most banks expect funding conditions to remain very benign and costs to decline even further.

Overall, competent authorities have largely or fully applied the ESAs Guidelines, which have thus significantly contributed to the convergence of assessment practices of proposed acquisition or increase of qualifying holdings across the EU. The EBA\u2019s ad hoc Peer Review Committee\u2019s conclusions included in this Report are based on competent authorities\u2019 self-assessment of how they applied selected areas of the Joint ESAs Guidelines on the prudential assessment of the acquisition of qualifying holdings, notably the notion of acting in concert, significant influence, indirect qualifying holdings, assessment of completeness of the notification and time limits, financial soundness, reputation of the acquirer, and selected aspects relating to the fifth assessment criterion on money laundering /terrorist finance (ML/TF) risk. The Report also provides early indications as to the areas in which the ESAs Guidelines could provide additional guidance to the competent authorities, with a view to fostering convergence of practices. These include: review and enhancement of guidance on the fifth assessment criterion relating to ML/TF risk; additional guidance on the assessment of large and complex acquisitions, so as to achieve a more proportionate and efficient assessment; review of the guidance on the application of the proportionality principle; additional guidance on the content of documents and information to be provided with an application, in order to better explain supervisory expectations and speed up the pre-application phase. Legal basis Article 30 of the EBA Regulation requires that the EBA shall periodically conduct peer reviews of some or all of the activities of competent authorities within its remit, to further strengthen consistency and effectiveness in supervisory outcomes. In addition, the peer review shall include an assessment of, but shall not be limited to\u00a0 the effectiveness and the degree of convergence reached in the application of Union law and in supervisory practice, including guidelines adopted pursuant to Article 16 of the EBA Regulation, and the extent to which the supervisory practice achieves the objectives set out in Union law. The EBA shall produce a report setting out the results of the peer review. Joint ESAs Guidelines on the prudential assessment of the acquisition of qualifying holdings, JC/GL/2016, (\u2018The Guidelines\u2019) aim to provide the necessary legal certainty, clarity and predictability with regard to the assessment process contemplated in the sectoral Directives and Regulations. This peer review only assessed the application of the Guidelines by competent authorities supervising credit institutions authorised under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) in respect of which a notification has to be submitted to the competent authority of the target credit institution, pursuant to Article 22 of the CRD, in case of proposed acquisition or increase of qualifying holdings by a natural or legal person.

This end-2020 data serves as input for the internationally agreed standards on which a smaller subset of banks will be identified as global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs), following the final decision from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The EBA, acting as a central data hub in the disclosure process, updates this data on a yearly basis and provides a user-friendly platform to aggregate it across the EU. A stable sample of 27 institutions shows that the aggregate amount for total exposures, as measured for the leverage ratio, increased by 6.3%, the fastest pace on record, and stood at EUR 20.3 trillion at the end of 2020. Underwriting and payments activities increased by 31.4% and 5.5%, respectively, while aggregate values for trading and available-for-sale-securities increased by 9.9%. Equally, the value for both cross-jurisdictional claims and liabilities rose to the highest value since 2013 standing at EUR 8.1 trillion (3.7% increase from end-2019) and EUR 6.2 trillion (4.9% increase from end-2019), respectively. Conversely, securities outstanding decreased by 8.1% from end-2019, totally offsetting the 5.8% increase observed last year. Background legal basis and next steps The EBA Guidelines on disclosure of G-SIIs define uniform requirements for disclosing the values used during the identification and scoring process of G-SIIs, in line with the internationally agreed standards developed by the BCBS and the FSB. To promote a level playing field in the EU regarding these requirements and to increase transparency on the internal financial market, the current level of disclosure goes beyond the minimum standards required by the BCBS, both in terms of granularity of the disclosed information and applicable scope of institutions. Consequently, some of the group-specific templates currently published belong to institutions that have not contributed directly to the BCBS's G-SIB exercise. The Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the specification of the methodology for the identification and definition of subcategories of G-SIIs, and Guidelines on disclosure of G-SIIs have been developed in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD IV) on the basis of internationally agreed standards, such as the framework established by the BCBS and the FSB. The identification of a G-SII, which leads to higher capital buffer requirements, falls under the responsibility of national competent authorities and this process is updated by December 15 every year. The identification will be based on the disclosure of global denominators and G-SIB exercise results, which are expected to be published by the BCBS and the FSB in November each year. Any higher capital buffer requirements will then apply after about one year from the publication by competent authorities of banks' scoring results, thus allowing institutions enough time to adjust to the new buffer requirement.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-updates-data-used-identification-global-systemically-important-institutions-g-siis-0"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0008", "date": "2021-08-18", "text_type": "PR", "title": "The EBA observes that the number of high earners in EU banks remained overall stable in 2019", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its Report on high earners for 2019. The analysis shows that in 2019, 4 963 individuals working for EU banks received a remuneration of more than EUR 1 million, which is mostly the same as in 2018. The average ratio between the variable and fixed remuneration for high earners decreased from 139% in 2018 to 129% in 2019. Institutions\u2019 preparation for the UK withdrawal from the EU has affected the distribution of high earners across the EU with a number of high earners relocating from the UK to the EU. In 2019, the largest share of high earners of 3\u00a0519 (71% of the total number of high earners), was located in the United Kingdom (UK). Most of the Member States across the EU registered a slight increase in the number of high earners, particularly Germany, France, and Italy. The increase of high earners resulted mostly from the impact of the relocation of staff from the UK to EU27 as part of Brexit preparations. In addition, for some institutions, the overall good financial results, particularly in corporate banking, and the ongoing restructuring and consolidations, which led to higher than usual severance payments, played an important role in the overall increase of high earners. The\u00a0average ratio between the variable and fixed component for all high earners decreased from 139% in 2018 to 129% in 2019. In the business area of asset management, the average ratio of variable to fixed remuneration decreased from 378% in 2018 to 339% in 2019, still far exceeding the maximum ratio of 200%. This is mainly due to differences in the national implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), that in many cases allows for waivers of some provisions when certain criteria are met. Following the amendments of the CRD, which started to apply as of the end of 2020, a higher degree of harmonisation is expected. Legal basis and next steps This Report has been developed in accordance with Article 75(3) of the CRD, which mandates the EBA to collect information on the number of individuals per institution that are remunerated EUR one million or more per financial year (high earners) in pay brackets EUR one million, including the business area involved and the main elements of salary, bonus, long-term award, and pension contribution. The Report includes data reported by UK institutions for high earners, as during the transitional period, UK institutions continued reporting data on high earners at EU consolidation level, covering all subsidiaries and branches established in EU Member States. The EBA will continue to benchmark remuneration trends biannually (e.g. for the performance years 2019 and 2020, a benchmarking exercise will take place in 2021 and will be published in the first quarter 2022). In addition, the EBA will continue to publish data on high earners annually to closely monitor and evaluate developments in this area.

The Report sets out the EBA\u2019s observations on the functioning of colleges during the year and the progress achieved in key areas of resolution planning. The Report reflects on the effects of moving to a virtual format of discussion on foot of the pandemic, and notes that the enforced change was broadly successful and reflected well on contingency planning measures. However, it also highlights areas for improvement to ensure that information exchange and coordination between members remains robust. Key findings of the Report Colleges across the EU were required by the pandemic to change from the traditional format of physical meetings to a virtual format. Overall, this was considered to have occurred in a relatively seamless fashion although it was observed that meetings were shorter, less interactive and challenging than previously observed. The role of colleges in the joint decision-making process generally functioned well with decisions being taken within the prescribed timelines. Discussions in colleges continued to focus on operational aspects of resolution plans.\u00a0 There was no evidence of an acceleration or reprioritisation of actions or consideration of alternative resolution strategies in response to the pandemic. The uncertainty of the impact of the pandemic may explain this. Additionally, progress in some areas of resolution planning was less than anticipated, as banks\u2019 resources were devoted to responding to the day-to-day effects of the pandemic. The EBA also noted that the proposals made in the 2019 Report for increased engagement with competent ministries and administrators of deposit guarantee schemes, did not generate detailed discussion. Areas to be monitored in 2021 For the 2021 cycle of resolution college meetings, the EBA intends to continue to monitor the same issues as set out in the 2019 Report. The passage of time means that as the effects of the pandemic have become clearer, the impact in each area is more open to considered analysis. To recall, the four areas are; the credibility and feasibility of the preferred resolution strategy in the current environment and the analysis of alternative resolution strategies; the extent to which supervisory authorities, finance ministries and administrators of deposit guarantee schemes are actively involved in consideration of their respective roles; analysis of the suitability of written arrangements underpinning colleges; the extent to which colleges undertake reviews of \u2018Business Reorganisation Plans\u2019 to assess if changes are required in response to the economic effects of Covid-19. Note to the editors\u00a0 Resolution colleges are fora for ongoing interactive engagement between the relevant authorities (home and host resolution authorities, supervisors, finance ministries, administrators of deposit guarantee schemes)\u00a0in order to plan and be ready to execute the effective resolution of cross-border banking groups. Their role is wider and more significant than the simple process of holding physical meetings or conference calls. Joint decisions on resolution plans, impediments to resolvability and MREL represent core deliverables of the resolution college work as required by the BRRD. In line with its mandate to promote the effective and consistent functioning of resolution colleges across the EU, the EBA monitored the activities of colleges established for large cross-border banking groups.

Once adopted, these Guidelines will apply to all financial sector operators that are within the scope of the AML Directive. This consultation runs until 2\u00a0November 2021. The draft Guidelines comprehensively address, for the first time at the level of the EU, the whole AML/CFT governance set-up. They set clear expectations of the role, tasks and responsibilities of the AML/CFT compliance officer and the management body and how they interact, including at group level. AML/CFT compliance officers need to have a sufficient level of seniority, which entails the powers to propose, on their own initiative, all necessary or appropriate measures to ensure the compliance and effectiveness of the internal AML/CFT measures to the management body in its supervisory and management function. Without prejudice to the overall and collective responsibility of the management body, the draft Guidelines also specify the tasks and role of the member of the management board, or the senior manager where no management board exists, who are in charge of AML/CFT overall, and on the role of group AML/CFT compliance officers. As information reaching the management body needs to be sufficiently comprehensive to enable informed decision-making, the draft Guidelines set out which information should be at least included in the activity report of the AML/CFT compliance officer to the management body. Where a financial services operator is part of a group, the draft Guidelines provide that a Group AML/CFT compliance officer in the parent company should be appointed to ensure the establishment and implementation of effective group-wide AML/CFT policies and procedures and to ensure that any shortcomings in the AML/CFT framework affecting the entire group or a large part of the group are addressed effectively. Provisions in the draft Guidelines are designed to be applied in a proportionate manner, taking into account the diversity of financial sector operators that are within the scope of the AML Directive. They are also in line with existing ESA guidelines, in particular: the revised Guidelines on internal governance under the capital requirements Directive (CRD); the revised Joint ESMA and EBA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body; the draft Guidelines on the authorisation of credit institutions; and the draft Guidelines for common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) and supervisory stress testing.

Credit losses, like in previous such exercises, would explain most of the capital depletion. The \u201clower-for-longer\u201d scenario narrative would also result in a significant decrease in the contribution of profits from continuing operations, especially from net interest income. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today the results of its 2021 EU-wide stress test, which involved 50 banks from 15 EU and EEA countries, covering 70% of the EU banking sector assets. This exercise allows to assess, in a consistent way, the resilience of EU banks over a three-year horizon under both a baseline and an adverse scenario, which is characterised by severe shocks taking into account the impact of the pandemic. The individual bank results promote market discipline and are an input into the supervisory decision-making process. The adverse scenario has an impact of 485 bps on banks\u2019 CET1 fully loaded capital ratio (497 bps on a transitional basis), leading to a 10.2% CET1 capital ratio at the end of 2023 (10.3% on a transitional basis).

This was achieved despite an unprecedented decline of the EU\u2019s GDP and the first effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. This year\u2019s stress test is characterised by an adverse scenario that assumes a prolonged Covid-19 scenario in a \u201clower for longer\u201d interest rate environment. With a cumulative drop in GDP over the three-year horizon by 3.6% in the EU, and a negative cumulative drop in the GDP of every member state, the 2021 adverse scenario is very severe, also having in mind the weaker macroeconomic starting point in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. The baseline scenario also provides some comparable information about individual banks in the context of a gradual exit from the pandemic. Against this background, under the adverse scenario, the EU banking system as a whole would see its CET1 reduced by 485 bps on a fully loaded basis (497 bps on a transitional basis) after three years, while staying above 10%[1]. The results also show dispersion across banks. For instance, those banks more focused on domestic activities or with lower net interest income (NII), display a higher depletion. Credit losses and lower income are the main drivers The overall impact results in a CET1 depletion of EUR 265bn, and in an increase of the total risk exposure amount (REA) of EUR 868bn at the end of the three-year horizon, resulting in a 485 bps decrease in the CET1 ratio. The key specific risk drivers contributing to the overall impact on CET1 capital ratio on a fully loaded basis include: credit risk losses of EUR 308bn (i.e. -423 bps of CET1); market risk losses, including counterparty credit risk, of EUR 74bn (-102 bps of CET1); operational risk losses, including conduct risk, of EUR 49bn (-68 bps of CET1). The final CET1 capital ratio is also affected by a sluggish economic environment. The contribution of income only stands at 290 bps, significantly lower compared to previous exercises, mainly as a result of lower NII. Special focus on the Covid-19 support measures Based on the stress test methodology, EBA-compliant moratoria are assumed to have expired, and their mitigating effect is, therefore, disregarded. On the other hand, Public Guarantee Schemes (PGS) benefitting certain exposures are assumed to stay in place throughout the stress test horizon. The 2021 exercise provides additional disclosures on the exposures that have been subject to Covid-19 support measures \u2013 i.e. moratoria and PGS. In the adverse scenario, banks with more exposures towards sectors highly affected by the pandemic display an increase of their loans in stage 3 (with a ratio of stage 3 to total loans from 2.8% in 2020 to 9.1% in 2023) which shows a higher credit risk when compared to the overall sample of banks (the overall stage 3 ratio increased from 2.1% to 6.3%). In terms of Covid-19 support measures, at the beginning of the exercise, 4.2% of total exposures had benefitted of EBA-compliant moratoria (of which 1.4% had not yet expired as of December 2020) and 1.6% of total exposures benefitted from PGS. Given the importance of tracking the evolution of credit risk for loans that had been subject to public support measures, it is worth highlighting the higher increase of the stage 3 ratio over the stress test horizon for loans under moratoria (from 3.1% to 13.4%). For exposures under PGS, the stage 3 ratio reaches 6.8% in 2023 (1.1% in 2020). Transparency and input to the SREP The EBA published the granular bank results, including detailed information at the starting and end point of the exercise, under both the baseline and the adverse scenarios. The EBA EU-wide stress test does not consider a defined pass/fail threshold. However, it provides an important input for the Pillar 2 assessment of banks by their supervisors. The results of the stress test will assist Competent Authorities in assessing banks\u2019 ability to meet applicable prudential requirements under the stress scenario and form a solid ground for discussion between the supervisor and the individual banks on their capital and distribution plans, in the context of the normal supervisory cycle. Notes to the editors The EU-wide stress test is initiated and coordinated by the EBA and undertaken in cooperation with the EU Competent Authorities, including the European Central Bank (ECB) for the Banking Union, and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). The EBA develops a common methodology and is responsible for the final dissemination of the outcome of the exercise. The adverse scenario is designed jointly by the ESRB and the ECB, and the baseline scenario is provided by the national central banks. Competent Authorities, including the ECB Banking Supervision for the euro area banks, are responsible for ensuring that banks correctly apply the common methodology. In particular, they are responsible for assessing the reliability and robustness of banks\u2019 assumptions, data, estimates and results and the resulting supervisory actions. The EU-wide stress test is based on the implementation by the banks of the EBA\u2019s methodology and the two scenarios, under the close scrutiny of their supervisors (\u201cconstrained bottom-up\u201d exercise). The support measures deployed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have required some methodological adjustments. EBA-compliant moratoria were assumed to expire at the end of 2020, while the guarantees related to PGS were assumed to remain in place over the stress test horizon. The amendments to the capital requirements regulation published in June 2020 (the \u2018CRR Quick Fix\u2019) were taken into account. Compared to the 2018 exercise, the measurement of the impact of the foreign exchange variation has also been adjusted. This stress test was initially scheduled for 2020 but postponed by 1 year as part of the temporary relief measures decided by the EBA due to the pandemic. Instead, in 2020, the EBA has released two Transparency exercises (in late Spring and Autumn), to inform the public on the conditions of the EU banking sector at the start of the COVID-19 crisis and the impact of the crisis in the first half of 2020, without any additional reporting burden for banks. In addition, in May 2020 the EBA published a Thematic Note (EBA Rep/2020/17) analysing the preliminary effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the EU banking sector, including a sensitivity analysis on parts of banks\u2019 credit and market risk portfolios. \u00a0\r \t [1] For banks under the ECB-SSM banking supervision, the fully loaded CET1 capital ratio at the starting point is 14.7% (15% transitional) and reaches a level of 9.7% (9.9% transitional) at the end of 2023.

The Guidelines specify how third country groups should calculate and monitor the total value of their assets in the Union in order to ensure timely application of the IPU requirement. The CRD introduced a requirement for institutions that are part of third-country groups to have an IPU established in the Union, where the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group is equal to or greater than EUR 40 billion. These Guidelines clarify the relevant data for the calculation of the total value of the assets in the Union, taking into account the fluctuation in the value of assets. In particular, the Guidelines specify that for the purpose of the application of the IPU requirement, the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group should be calculated as an average over the last four quarters. This value should be monitored on a quarterly basis and communicated to relevant competent authorities. To meet the IPU requirement in a timely manner, institutions belonging to third-country groups must apply a forward-looking approach. The Guidelines specify that they should assess at least annually whether the threshold is expected to be reached within the three-year horizon, based on the strategic planning of the third-country group and the forecast of assets. In addition, these Guidelines specify certain procedural aspects related to the monitoring of the threshold by competent authorities and the establishment of the IPU where necessary. In particular, clarification is provided on the notifications, to be provided to the EBA on an annual basis. Legal basis, background These draft Guidelines have been developed in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices and to ensuring the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law.

The discussion paper invites all market participants affected by the proportional treatment in the application of EBA regulatory products to provide their input. The consultation runs until 22 October 2021. The proportionality assessment methodology entails two separate steps: (a) the definition of four different classifications and (b) the definition of the metrics applicable to the different categorisations in view of assessing whether there is need for proportional treatment of the different categories of institutions. The first step proposes three different categorisations for credit institutions and a categorisation for investment firms. Although all categorisations comprise a different mixture of size and risk profile discriminatory criteria, the discrimination according to size is more predominant in two categorisations of credit institutions (classification I and classification III), while the business model categorisation (classification II) addresses the risk profile of credit institutions based on the stock of exposures, international activity and systemic importance. Finally, the categorisation of investment firms (classification IV) constitutes a well-balanced mixture of size and risk profile discriminatory factors.

More than half of central bank eligible assets and collateral are now encumbered. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its annual report on Asset Encumbrance. As COVID-19 spread across Europe, banks made extensive use of central bank facilities to strengthen their liquidity buffers and maintain the flow of credit to the real economy. This resulted in the largest yearly rise in the asset encumbrance ratio since data is available. Overview of key figures Asset Encumbrance ratio Encumbrance ratio of central bank eligible assets Q4 2020 27.8% 50.3% Q4 2019 25.0% 44.1% The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significative increase in encumbrance. Amid wholesale funding tensions in the first half of 2020, banks made an extensive use of secured funding to maintain their support to the real economy. The substantial increase in total assets was outpaced by the rise in encumbered assets and collateral. Central bank funding has become the main source of asset encumbrance. The extensive use of central bank liquidity facilities has driven up the share of central bank funding over total sources of encumbrance. As a result, more than half of central bank eligible assets are already encumbered. In contrast, banks have reduced their reliance on covered bonds given the favourable conditions of central bank facilities, an increasing deposit base, and banks\u2019 focus on the issuance of MREL eligible instruments. After a sharp rise, the average overcollateralization (OC) level of banks\u2019 secured funding returned to pre-COVID levels. Amidst market tensions in the first quarter of 2020, banks were requested margin calls and had to pledge additional collateral to obtain secured funding. As market instability receded and the ECB eased collateral requirements, OC levels returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nonetheless, this metric remains higher for certain funding categories such as derivatives. Increasing encumbrance ratios might pose prudential risks. Although banks exhibit comfortable liquidity buffers, as encumbrance subordinates unsecured creditors, the latter might demand higher spreads. Moreover, secured creditors may apply larger haircuts on collateral or make margin calls. This could lead to an adverse feedback loop of higher encumbrance and higher funding costs.

Mystery shopping allows NCAs to obtain greater insight into the conduct of financial institutions, which in turn allows them to take corrective actions to better comply with applicable requirements, thus eventually enhancing the protection of consumers. This publication is the EBA\u2019s next step in the fulfillment of its new mandate to coordinate MS activities of NCAs. The European Banking Authority (EBA)\u00a0published today a methodological guide to mystery shopping (MS). This guide has been developed based on the findings and good practices identified in the EBA report on MS activities of NCAs published earlier this year and aims to support NCAs in the design and implementation of MS activities. The guide sets out in seven steps how MS activities can be conceived and carried out, how NCAs can use the guide as a complement to other existing supervisory tools, and how to adapt such activities to the particular circumstances, goals and MS powers conferred on an NCA under national law and/or EU law, such as the EU Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation. The guide applies irrespective of whether the activity is carried out directly by the supervisors or outsourced to an external provider. In addition, the guide applies to both online and on-site MS activities but focuses on the latter, due to the type of activities on which the knowledge and experiences of NCAs, and therefore this guide, is based. The guide is not mandatory and does not aim to harmonise the MS practices of NCAs or imply that all NCAs would need to adopt it as supervisory tool. Rather, the guide aims to support those NCAs that are, under their respective national legal framework, in a position to carry out MS activities in designing and implementing MS activities, thus facilitating the coordination of their MS activities and enhancing their ability to assess the retail conduct of financial institutions in their jurisdictions.

Such payment instruments include store cards, fuel cards, public transport cards, and meal vouchers. Given the significant inconsistencies the EBA has identified on how this exclusion is applied across the EU, the proposed Guidelines aim at clarifying specific aspects of its application, including on how a network of service providers or a range of goods and services should be assessed in order to qualify as \u2018limited\u2019, the use of payment instruments within limited networks, the provision of excluded services by regulated financial institutions and the submission of notification to competent authorities (CAs). The consultation runs until 15 October 2021. In line with its statutory objective of contributing to the convergence of supervisory practices, the EBA arrived at the view that it should issue own-initiative Guidelines aimed at bringing about convergence on a number of issues related to the application of this exclusion. In particular, the draft Guidelines propose requirements, and where relevant, criteria and indicators, aimed at ensuring that excluded payment instruments are used in a limited way, thus reducing potential risks that may arise for the users of such instruments. In addition, in order to address potential concerns on any possible circumvention of the PSD2 requirements and to increase transparency for consumers who may not be aware that they do not benefit from the protection the PSD2 provides to regulated services, the draft Guidelines propose requirements on the provision of excluded services by regulated firms. Finally, to ensure transparency on the provision of excluded services, the draft Guidelines provide clarity on the calculation of the thresholds set out in Article 37(2) of the PSD2, the submission of the related notifications to competent authorities and the information to be covered in the description of the excluded activity on the national and EBA registers.\u00a0 However, the proposed Guidelines cannot address all the inconsistencies that the EBA has identified, as the EBA is not in a position to change definitions or amend legal requirements set out in the PSD2.

A\u00a0public hearing\u00a0will take place online on 8 September 2021 from 10.00 to 12.00 CEST. Legal basis and background Following the publication of PSD2 in November 2015, the EBA and the European Commission (EC) have received a number of queries on the interpretation and application of the exclusion under Article 3(k) of the PSD2 and the related notification requirements articulated in Article 37 of the PSD2. The EBA assessed these queries and arrived at the view that the implementation and application of the requirements diverges significantly between Member States, thus impeding the Single Market for payment services in the EU and creating opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. The EBA issued the draft Guidelines under Article 16 of the EBA Regulation, which mandates the Authority to issue guidelines and recommendations addressed to Competent Authorities or financial institutions with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices, including, where appropriate, to conduct open public consultations. Article 3(k) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on payment services in the internal market (PSD2) specifies that the \u2018Directive does not apply to services based on specific payment instruments that can be used only in a limited way, that meet specified conditions. Article 37(2) of PSD2 prescribes that \u2018Member States shall require that service providers carrying out either of the activities referred to in points (i) and (ii) of point (k) of Article 3 or carrying out both activities, for which the total value of payment transactions executed over the preceding 12 months exceeds the amount of EUR 1 million, send a notification to competent authorities containing a description of the services offered, specifying under which exclusion referred to in point (k)(i) and (ii) of Article 3 the activity is considered to be carried out.\u2019 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-consults-draft-guidelines-limited-network-exclusion-under-revised-payment-services-directive"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0023", "date": "2021-07-13", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes final Guidelines for the use of data inputs in the expected shortfall risk measure under the Internal Model Approach", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final Guidelines clarifying the requirements that the data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to modellable risk factors should meet. The Guidelines, which are part of the deliverables included in the roadmap for the new market and counterparty credit risk approaches, will be applicable from 1 January 2022. Institutions using the alternative Internal Model Approach (IMA) for market risk are required to compute the expected shortfall (ES) risk measure for their modellable risk factors, i.e. for those risk factors for which a sufficient amount of verifiable prices is available. These Guidelines clarify the conditions that the data inputs related to modellable risk factors should meet for their use in the ES calculations. In particular, the final Guidelines set out criteria in relation to the accuracy, appropriateness, frequency for updating and completeness of the data inputs used by institutions for their modellable risk factors. These criteria aim at ensuring that data inputs are calibrated to historical data reflective of prices observed or quoted in the market, that they capture, where relevant, both general and specific risks, that their update is performed frequently enough and whenever changes in market conditions so require, and that any missing or inconsistent values in those data inputs are properly replaced. Legal Basis and background These Guidelines have been developed according to Article 325bh(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), which mandates the EBA to issue guidelines specifying criteria for the use of data inputs in the risk-measurement model referred to in Article 325bc. In August 2020, the EBA published a\u00a0Consultation Paper\u00a0on which these Guidelines are based. During the consultation period, the EBA received feedback from stakeholders, which led to amendments being introduced to clarify some specific provisions.

These draft standards, developed in consultation with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), provide a solid framework for (i) cooperation in the supervision of investment firm groups through colleges of supervisors and (ii) for information exchange for investment firms operating within the EU through branches or the free provision of services. These draft standards are part of the phase 2 mandates of the\u00a0EBA roadmap on investment firms, and aim at improving cooperation and information exchanges between the supervisors of investment firms. The final draft RTS on colleges of supervisors for investment firm groups specify the conditions under which colleges of supervisors exercise their tasks. The final draft RTS on colleges are structured around four main sections: (1) establishment of colleges, (2) functioning of colleges; (3) planning and coordination of supervisory activities in going concern situations; and (4) planning and coordination of supervisory activities in preparation for and during emergency situations. The \u00a0final draft RTS and ITS on information exchange between the competent authorities of home and host Member States complement the RTS on colleges of supervisors and address situations where investment firms operate in another Member State through branches or the free provision of services, where colleges may not be established. In particular, the final draft RTS specify the information that competent authorities in the host Member State and those in the home Member State shall exchange, whereas the final draft ITS establish standard forms, templates, and procedures for sharing the information specified in the RTS. All three standards apply to Class 2 and 3 investment firms and have been prepared reflecting on the supervisory experience in exchange of information and functioning of colleges for credit institutions, adjusting them to the needs of investment firms\u2019 supervision and embedding the proportionality principle. Legal basis The final draft RTS on colleges of supervisors for investment firms groups have been developed in accordance with Article 48(8) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034, which mandates the Authority to develop, in consultation with ESMA, draft RTS to specify the conditions under which the colleges of supervisors established for investment firms groups exercise their tasks. The final draft RTS and ITS on information exchange have been developed in accordance with Articles 13(7) and Article 13(8) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034, which mandate the Authority to develop regulatory and implementing technical standards on the exchange of information between home and host competent authorities supervising investment firms operating through branches.

This update takes into account the amendments introduced by the fifth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) in relation to institutions\u2019 sound remuneration policies and, in particular, the requirement that remuneration policies should be gender neutral. The final Guidelines also consider supervisory practices and clarify some aspects of retention bonuses and severance pays. The revised Guidelines will apply from 31 December 2021. The principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is laid down in Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Institutions need to apply this principle in a consistent manner. In this context, the final revised Guidelines specify further that institutions should implement a gender-neutral remuneration policy. All institutions are also required to apply sound and gender-neutral remuneration policies to all staff. Additional guidance is provided on the application of waivers based on institutions\u2019 total balance sheet and for staff with a low variable remuneration that have been introduced with CRD V regarding the requirements to defer and pay out in instruments a part of the variable remuneration of identified staff. The final Guidelines also clarify how the remuneration framework applies on a consolidated basis to financial institutions that are subject to a specific remuneration framework (for example, firms subject to the Investment Firms Directive (IFD), the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS), or the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD)). Finally, the sections on severance payments and retention bonuses have been revised based on supervisory experience regarding cases where such elements have been used by institutions to circumvent requirements regarding the link to performance or the maximum ratio. Legal basis and next steps These Guidelines have been developed on the basis of Article 74 and 94 of Directive 2013/36/EU, which mandate the EBA to further specify and harmonise institutions\u2019 remuneration policies. The EBA Guidelines will apply to Competent Authorities across the EU, as well as to institutions on an individual and consolidated basis as further specified in the guidelines.

The update takes into account the amendments introduced by the fifth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) and the Investment Firms Directive (IFD) in relation to credit institutions\u2019 sound and effective governance arrangements, in particular with regard to gender diversity, money laundering, financing terrorist risk and the management of conflicts of interest, including in the context of loans and other transactions with members of the management body and their related parties. The final revised Guidelines will apply from 31 December 2021. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is crucial for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Therefore, uncovering any involvement of credit institutions and investment firms in money laundering and terrorist financing can have an impact on the viability and trust in the financial system. In this context, these Guidelines clarify that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions\u2019 risk management framework. The revised Guidelines further specify and reinforce the framework regarding loans to members of the management body and their related parties. Those loans may constitute a specific source of actual or potential conflict of interest and, therefore, specific provisions have been explicitly included in the Directive CRD. In the same way, other transactions with members of the management body and their related parties have the potential to create conflicts of interest and, therefore, the EBA is providing guidance on how to properly manage them. Finally, in line with the requirement to have a gender-neutral remuneration policy, the revised Guidelines provide new guidance on the code of conduct to ensure that credit institutions take all necessary measures to avoid any form of discrimination and guarantee equal opportunities to staff of all genders. In addition, institutions should monitor the gender pay-gap. Legal basis and next steps These Guidelines have been developed on the basis of Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU, which mandates the EBA to further harmonise credit institutions\u2019 governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms across the EU.

The joint final Guidelines will apply from 31 December 2021. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of credit institutions and investment firms in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. In this context, the final joint Guidelines clarify, in line with CRD V, that assessing the knowledge, experience and skill requirements include identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risks, as these aspects are part of the assessments of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders. In addition, a gender balanced composition of the management body is of particular importance. Institutions should respect the principle of equal opportunities for any gender and take measures to improve a more gender balanced composition of staff in management positions so as to ensure a more gender balanced pool of candidates for positions within the management body. The joint Guidelines also take into account the recovery and resolution framework introduced by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and provide further guidance in this regard. As part of early intervention measures and during resolution, the suitability of newly appointed members of the management body and the management body collectively are relevant and require an assessment. The Guidelines provide further details on how the exchange of information between resolution authorities and competent authorities should work. Finally, the joint Guidelines take into account the new legislative framework for investment firms adopted in 2019 by the Investment Firms Regulation (IFR) and IFD, for the identification of the investment firms subject to the various guidelines. Legal basis and next steps The joint Guidelines have been developed according to Article 91 (12) of the CRD and Article 9 of the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID 2).

The revised Decision, which reflects the recognition of two additional ECAIs and the de-registering of three ECAIs, is part of the Single Rulebook in banking and will ensure regulatory harmonisation across the European Union (EU) regarding the use of unsolicited credit ratings for determining institutions' own funds requirements. Institutions may use unsolicited credit assessments of an ECAI for determining their capital requirements only if the EBA has confirmed that those unsolicited ratings do not differ in quality from solicited ratings of that same ECAI. Since the last EBA Decision, two additional ECAIs have been recognised, and three ECAIs have been de-registered or de-certified. In addition, a registered ECAI has been renamed. The revised Decision has been amended to reflect these developments and is based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis, also published today. Legal basis and background The EBA Decision has been developed on the basis of Article 138 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation \u2014 CRR), which establishes that institutions may use unsolicited credit assessments of an ECAI for the determination of capital requirements only if the EBA has confirmed that those unsolicited ratings do not differ in quality from solicited ratings of that ECAI. In particular, the EBA shall refuse or revoke the confirmation if the ECAI has used an unsolicited credit assessment to put pressure on the rated entity to place an order for a credit assessment or other services. On 17 May 2016, the EBA issued a Decision allowing the use of unsolicited credit assessments for 22 ECAIs in the context of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).

The IFR/IFD classify investment firms according to their business model and size, the latter of which is benchmarked on various threshold. For the vast majority of investment firms, sufficient clarity already exists with regards to the prudential regime, which applies to them. However, in a few cases, especially for investment firms of third country groups, the Opinion provides guidance on the actions to be taken in case of uncertainty on whether these investment firms should apply for an authorisation as a credit institution in the absence of the delegated act establishing the methodology for the calculation of the highest threshold (the EUR 30bn threshold), on which the EBA has currently opened a second public consultation. The EBA road map on investment firms sets out the EBA\u2019s considerations on the implementation of the IFR/IFD. With the entry into force of the new prudential regime for investment firms, concerns have been raised on a practical issue related to the implementation, given that the regulatory technical standard (RTS) on the determination of the EUR 30bn threshold is currently subject to a second consultation. The present Opinion provides clarity to both investment firms and their supervisors in the specific cases, where uncertainty about the relevant classification, and subsequent need for application for an authorisation as a credit institution, arises in the absence of the technical standards. In general, the EBA advises competent authorities to apply a pragmatic approach for those investment firms, where the relevant EUR 30bn threshold for the identification of the prudential regime to be applied to the investment firm cannot be determined without the guidance provided in the EBA RTS currently being consulted on. More specifically, the EBA advises supervisors not to prioritise any supervisory or enforcement action in relation to the identification of investments firms, until six months after the final methodology is in place. Legal basis and next steps This Opinion is based on Article 9c of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, which mandates the EBA to take action in case the absence of delegated or implementing acts would raise legitimate doubts concerning the legal consequences flowing from the act or its proper application. The Opinion relates to the application of Article 8(a) of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD) and provides clarity on the approach to be taken by firms for the determination of the prudential regime to be applied. Concretely, it specifies how to determine whether the EUR 30bn threshold has been reached until the adoption of the EBA RTS on EUR 30bn threshold methodology. The European Commission also issued a statement regarding the prudential requirements applicable to investment firms, which are currently considered as such, but which are required to take all the necessary steps to seek and obtain authorisation as credit institutions. The statement clarifies that these investment firms will continue to be subject to the CRR/CRD rules as they stood on the day prior to the date of application of the new framework, in accordance with Article 58 of the IFR, during the short period until they are granted authorisation by their competent authorities.

The RTS aim to clarify requirements relating to risk retention, thus reducing the risk of moral hazard and aligning interests. The RTS also provide clarity on new topics, including risk retention in traditional securitisation of non-performing exposures (NPE). The consultation runs until 30 September 2021. The RTS carry over a substantial amount of provisions from the\u00a0EBA RTS on risk retention\u00a0submitted to the European Commission in July 2018. The RTS also include a number of new provisions, such as specifying modalities of risk retention in traditional NPE securitisations and specifying requirements for the expertise of servicers acting as a retainers in such NPE securitisations. In addition, the RTS address some specific issues, related, for instance, to the impact of fees payable to the retainer on risk retention, risk retention in re-securitisations or in securitisations of own issued debt instruments. They also provide clarification on the treatment of synthetic excess spread. By providing additional clarity on risk retention in case of portfolios of NPE, this publication is also part of the EBA comprehensive work on supporting the functioning of the secondary markets for NPE.

Strong rise of forborne loans, but stable forbearance ratio amid a similar rise in total loans and advances. Return on equity rose strongly QoQ, not least due to declining cost of risk. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its quarterly Risk Dashboard together with the results of the spring edition of the Risk Assessment Questionnaire (RAQ). The Q1 data shows that the CET1 ratio increased slightly on a fully loaded basis. The NPL ratio improved further, except for some sectors that may have been more affected by the pandemic. Banks\u2019 profitability improved significantly. The CET1 ratio increased again slightly in Q1 2021. It reached 15.6% on a fully loaded basis amid a nearly parallel rise of the numerator (CET1 capital) and denominator (risk weighted assets, RWA). The latter came in parallel to an increase in total assets. The leverage ratio declined from 5.8% in Q4 2020 to 5.6% in Q1 2021 on a fully loaded basis. The NPL ratio declined despite a slight rise in NPL volumes. It reached 2.5%, down by 10bps compared to the previous quarter. Even though the NPL ratio declined on broad average, some sectors reported an increase. The biggest rise was among accommodation and food services (further up from 8.4% to 9.0% QoQ) as well as arts, entertainment and recreation (further up from 7.2% to 7.9%). The volume of forborne loans rose by 7.6% in Q1. However, amid the even more pronounced rise of the denominator (total loans and advances) the forbearance ratio remained unchanged at 2.0%. The stage ratio 2 ratio slightly declined from 9.1% to 9.0% in Q1. Looking forward, the RAQ results show that a comparatively high share of banks expects rather a deterioration in the asset quality of most portfolios. More than 70% of the banks expect the asset quality of SME loans to deteriorate, followed by consumer credit (around 65%) and commercial real estate (CRE) exposures (around 55%). However, asset quality expectations slightly improved for the first time since spring 2019 as the share of banks expecting a deterioration of asset quality declined slightly for nearly all portfolios. Loans under EBA eligible moratoria declined further in Q1 2021. They reached around EUR 203bn (down from around EUR 318bn in Q4 2020). Whereas the share of stage 2 loans under moratoria remained nearly stable at 27.3%, the NPL ratio showed a significant rise from 3.3% in Q4 2020 to 3.9% in Q1 2021. For loans with expired moratoria, the stage 2 ratio reached 23.7% (20.2% in the previous quarter) and the NPL ratio was 4.5% (4.0% in in the previous quarter). The rise in loans under public guarantee schemes (PGS) slowed down, reaching around EUR 378bn in Q1, up from EUR 343bn as of year-end (YE) 2020. Profitability improved strongly. Return on equity (RoE) rose to 7.6% in Q1 2021 from 1.9% as of YE 2020, driven by contracting cost of risk as well as rising fee & commission and trading income. The net interest margin (NIM) significantly contracted from 133bps to 124bps, ranging from 75bps up to 302bps among countries. The cost to income ratio decreased from 65.2% in Q4 2020 to 63.6% in Q1 2021. Cost of risk fell from 75bps to 53bps QoQ, showing a wide dispersion among banks. Close to 80% of the banks indicate in the RAQ that their cost of risk for the current financial year will not exceed 100bps. The loan to deposit ratio declined further from 112.2% in Q4 to 111.0% in Q1, supported by a bigger rise in client deposits from households and NFCs than respective loans. The asset encumbrance ratio increased from 27.9% as of YE 2020 to 28.8% in Q1 2021, presumably not least due to a further rise in central bank funding (TLTRO3) during the quarter. Looking forward, banks intend to focus their funding mainly on senior non-preferred/senior issuances from the holding company (HoldCo; nearly 50%) and preferred senior unsecured debt (more than 40%) in the next 12 months. A further rising share of banks reported their intention to draw funding from central banks (up to more than 20% from 15% in autumn last year, and 0% in autumn the year before). Close to 60% of the banks see an increase in operational risk, which is similar to previous surveys. Also, in line with their previous responses, banks consider cyber risk and data security issues as the main source for increasing operational risk (close to 90%), followed by conduct and legal risk (around 45%). Notes to editors The figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 131 banks, covering more than 80% of the EU/EEA banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates also include large subsidiaries (the list of banks can be found here). The EBA conducts semi-annual Risk Assessment Questionnaires among banks and market analysts. This Risk Assessment Questionnaire was carried out in spring 2021, in which 59 banks and 10 market analysts submitted their answers.

The Report assesses the overall benefits and challenges faced by financial institutions and RegTech providers in the use of RegTech. It also identifies potential risks arising from\u00a0RegTech solutions that supervisors will need to address and proposes actions designed to enhance knowledge and skills in competent authorities. These actions also aim to ensure technological neutrality in regulatory and supervisory approaches to RegTech, whilst addressing any inadvertent obstacles within the Single Market to facilitate the adoption of RegTech across the EU. Key conclusions and the way forward The EBA is committed to technological neutrality which requires constant monitoring and sharing of information on technological developments. The EBA Report looks at the application of technology-enabled innovation for regulatory, compliance and reporting requirements and provides a deep-dive analysis into the five most frequently used RegTech segments: Anti Money-Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), fraud prevention, prudential reporting, ICT security and creditworthiness assessment. The deep-dive on RegTech for prudential reporting reflects findings identified in the EBA recent study on cost of compliance with supervisory reporting requirements (published here) which recommends wider use of technology and raising awareness of possible use cases for RegTech in supervisory reporting. Financial institutions highlight enhanced risk management, better monitoring and sampling capabilities, and reduced human errors as the main benefits of use of RegTech solutions. RegTech providers emphasise the ability to increase efficiency, quell the impact of ongoing regulatory change and improve effectiveness. The evidence suggests that the majority of challenges to RegTech market development are internal factors within financial institutions and RegTech providers. These relate to data (quality, security, privacy), interoperability and integration with the existing legacy systems, a lack of financial institutions\u2019 application programming interface (API) capabilities, costly and often lengthy and complex due diligence processes, and limited awareness of RegTech solutions. The current legal and regulatory framework has not been identified as the most material obstacle for RegTech adoption. However, a lack of common regulatory standards across Member States could pose barriers for wider market adoption of RegTech solutions across the Single Market. Building on the existing EBA\u2019s, ESAs\u2019 and CAs\u2019 ongoing initiatives, the EBA proposes the following steps to be taken to support sound adoption and scale-up of RegTech solutions: activities to deepen knowledge and address any skill gaps among regulators and supervisors on RegTech; support convergence of supervisory practices across the EU in the treatment of RegTech; and provide clarity on supervisory expectations; further steps to harmonise the legal and regulatory requirements, where appropriate; further leverage the role and expertise of the European Forum for Innovation Facilitators (EFIF) and the national regulatory sandboxes and innovation hubs as a safe testing environment for RegTech solutions. In Q4 2021, the EBA will organise a public online webinar to present and discuss the main findings of the RegTech market analysis in the EU. Legal basis and background Article 31 of the EBA Founding Regulation Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 mandates the Authority to promote supervisory convergence and facilitate entry into the market of actors or products relying on technological innovation, in particular through the exchange of information and best practices. The aim of this mandate is to ensure technological neutrality in regulatory and supervisory approaches to technology and contribute to the establishment of a common European approach towards technological innovation. The analysis of RegTech in the EU financial sector is designed to raise awareness on RegTech within the regulatory and supervisory community and inform any relevant future policy discussion.

The comprehensive revisions aim at implementing the recent amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR II), as well as aligning with other regulatory developments and best supervisory practices. The consultation runs until 28\u00a0September 2021. SREP is an ongoing supervisory process bringing together findings from all supervisory activities into a comprehensive supervisory overview of an institution. These Guidelines aim at achieving convergence of practices followed by competent authorities across the EU in their SREP and supervisory stress testing processes. The current review of the SREP Guidelines affects all main SREP elements, including (i) business model analysis, (ii) assessment of internal governance and institution-wide control arrangements, (iii) assessment of risks to capital and capital adequacy to cover these risks, and (iv) assessment of liquidity and funding risks and adequacy of liquidity resources to cover such risks. The main amendments implementing the requirements laid down in the CRD V and CRR II include the following: reviewing institutions\u2019 categorisation and application of the minimum engagement model to reflect the new definitions on small and non-complex as well as large institutions, thus better embedding the proportionality principle; incorporating an assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) \u00a0risks, in line with the\u00a0EBA Opinion\u00a0on how to take into account ML/TF risks in the SREP published in November 2020; reviewing the provisions on Pillar 2 capital add-ons and the Pillar 2 guidance in accordance with Articles 104a and 104b of Directive 2013/36/EU, to ensure that they reflect a purely microprudential perspective; providing clarifications on the assessment of the risk of excessive leverage and the related Pillar 2 capital add-ons and the Pillar 2 guidance in order to reflect the separate stack of own funds requirements based on the leverage ratio; adjusting the requirements for the assessment of the interest rate risk in the non-trading book, as well as the assessment of liquidity risk and liquidity adequacy to align them with the current regulatory framework.

For credit institutions that operate in Estonia and use the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, the measure introduces a minimum level for the average risk weight for residential mortgage loans to obligors residing in Estonia. Based on the evidence submitted, the EBA does not object to the extension of the proposed measure, which will be applied for two years. With the application of this measure, Eesti Pank extends the credit institution-specific minimum level of 15% for the exposure-weighted average of the risk weights applied to the portfolio of retail exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property to obligors residing in Estonia. The measure applies to credit institutions that operate in Estonia and use the IRB approach for calculating regulatory capital requirements. In its Opinion, addressed to the Council, the European Commission and the Estonian Central Bank, the EBA acknowledged the concerns of Eesti Pank over the build-up of risks in the residential real estate sector, the risk stemming from the macroeconomic environment, and the high concentration of IRB banks in the housing loan market in the country. Based on this analysis, the EBA does not object to the two-year extension of the application period of the measure. Background In its Opinion dated 15 May 2019, the EBA concluded that the evidence presented by Eesti Pank was not sufficient to support the suitability and appropriateness of the suggested measure after taking into account that, at that time, other microprudential measures could be more efficient in tackling the risks identified by Eesti Pank. The EBA confirmed its Opinion following the request of the Commission dated 26 July 2019 in relation to the revised notification received from Eesti Pank.

The objective of this update is to further strengthen the robustness and quality of EU institutions\u2019 own funds and eligible liabilities instruments. \u00a0 The updates to this Report reflect (i) the amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR2), (ii) the monitoring of the implementation of the EBA Opinion on legacy instruments, and (iii) observations on new market trends, such as ESG-linked capital instruments. Due to the high standardisation of the AT1 issuances, only limited new observations have been added to the Report since its last update. However, in the context of the end of the transitional period for legacy instruments, the EBA draws attention on the need to keep the capital structure simple and avoid additional layers within a capital class that would increase complexity. Further clarification on the implementation of the options in the EBA Opinion on legacy instruments is, therefore, provided in the Report. In addition, the EBA has identified differences in the clauses of the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issuances made for capital/loss absorbency purposes. In this regard, the EBA is providing best practices or practices that should be avoided for these issuances. The purpose is to give views and recommendations on how ESG capital bonds features are meant to interact with the eligibility criteria for own funds and eligible liabilities instruments, and ultimately to safeguard the quality of the instruments from a prudential perspective. The EBA will continue its monitoring and include any new observations in the next update of the AT1 report, in particular concerning the monitoring of the implementation of the EBA Opinion on legacy instruments at the end of the grandfathering period and on the development of ESG capital bonds. Legal basis and background In accordance with Article 80 of the CRR on the continuing review of the quality of own funds, the \u2018EBA shall monitor the quality of own funds and eligible liabilities instruments issued by institutions across the Union and shall notify the Commission immediately where there is significant evidence that those instruments do not meet the respective eligibility criteria set out in this Regulation\u2019.

The proposed amendments follow up on the European Commission\u2019s Action Plan to tackle non-performing loans in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which indicated the need for a revision of the treatment of defaulted exposures under the SA. This update is necessary to ensure the prudential framework does not create disincentives to the sale of non-performing assets. The consultation runs until 24\u00a0September\u00a02021. The Commission\u2019s Action Plan specifically asks the EBA to consider the appropriate regulatory treatment of defaulted assets, as laid out in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), which have been sold at a discount, i.e. NPL sales. Under the current regulatory framework, the capital charge for a defaulted exposure may \u2013 under certain circumstances - increase after its sale from a risk weight of 100% on the seller\u2019s balance sheet to a risk weight of 150% on the balance sheet of the credit institution buying the assets. The proposed amendment to the existing RTS on credit risk adjustments introduces a change to the recognition of total credit risk adjustments, which ensures that the risk weight can remain the same in both cases. In particular, the price discount stemming from the sale will be recognised as a credit risk adjustment for the purposes of determining the risk weight. By implementing this change through an RTS amendment, the EBA aims at clarifying the regulatory treatment of sold NPL assets. However, the EBA also recommends that the treatment set out in this RTS be included in the Commission\u2019s considerations as part of the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) proposal, which is expected at a later stage.

Legal basis and background Article 110(4)(e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 mandates the EBA to specify the amounts that need to be included in the calculation of credit risk adjustments for the determination of default under Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is desirable to remove any impediment to the creation of secondary markets for defaulted exposures. In this context, a misalignment between the risk weight applied to defaulted assets and the potential for unexpected losses in relation to the level of already expected losses could create undue obstacles for credit institutions to move their non-performing loans off their balance sheets. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the specific credit risk adjustments recognised for Article 127(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 incorporate any discount in a transaction price that the buyer has not recognised by increasing CET1 capital.

The EBA recommends integrating ESG risks into business strategies, governance and risk management as well as supervision in a timely manner. This report provides steer on supervisory expectations and sets the foundations for future EBA Guidelines on the topic. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its Report on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks management and supervision. The Report, which is a key component of the EBA\u2019s broader ESG work, provides a comprehensive proposal on how ESG factors and ESG risks should be included in the regulatory and supervisory framework for credit institutions and investment firms. The Report focuses on the resilience of institutions to the potential financial impact of ESG risks across different time horizons. This requires careful assessments by institutions and supervisors who should take a comprehensive and forward-looking view, as well as early, proactive actions. Impact of ESG risks. The Report outlines the impact that ESG factors, especially climate change, can have on institutions\u2019 counterparties or invested assets, affecting financial risks. Also, the Report illustrates available indicators, metrics and evaluation methods that are needed for effective ESG risk management and identifies remaining gaps and challenges on this front. Recommendations to incorporate ESG risks-related considerations. The EBA provides recommendations for institutions to incorporate ESG risks-related considerations in strategies and objectives, governance structures, and to manage these risks as drivers of financial risks in their risk appetite and internal capital allocation process. The EBA also recommends developing methodologies and approaches to test the long-term resilience of institutions against ESG factors and risks including the use of scenario analysis. Proposal for a phase-in approach. To further enhance the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), the EBA sees a need to extend the time horizon of the supervisory assessment of the resilience of institutions\u2019 business models, applying at least a 10 year horizon to capture physical risks, relevant public policies or broader transition trends. The Report proposes a phase-in approach, starting with the inclusion of climate-related and environmental factors and risks into the supervisory business model and internal governance analysis, whilst encouraging institutions and supervisors to build up data and tools to develop quantification approaches to increase the scope of the supervisory analysis to other elements. This Report should be considered in conjunction with the EBA and ESAs disclosure publications under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the Taxonomy Regulation and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) which provide key metrics to support strategies and risk management. The EBA will publish Pillar 3 disclosure requirements on ESG risks, transition risks and physical risks, as defined in this Report, later this year. Legal basis and background Article 98(8) of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRDV) and Article 35 of the Investment Firms Directive (IFD) mandate the EBA to develop a report providing uniform definitions of ESG risks, and appropriate qualitative and quantitative criteria (including stress tests and scenario analyses) for the assessment of the impact of ESG risks on the financial stability of institutions in the short, medium and long term. They also mandate the EBA to elaborate on the arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies to be implemented by institutions to identify, assess and manage ESG risks and to assess their potential inclusion in the review and evaluation performed by competent authorities. The Report has been transmitted to the EU Parliament, the Council and the European Commission, which are invited to take it into consideration in the context of the Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy and the review of CRR/CRD. The Report and its recommendations will be used by the EBA as a basis for the development of EBA Guidelines on the management of ESG risks by institutions and an update of the SREP Guidelines to include ESG risks in the supervision of credit institutions. The EBA will also take a sequential approach and leverage on the output of this Report to further enrich the SREP guidelines for investment firms under Article 35 of the IFD in due time.

The Report, which is addressed to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, illustrates the results of a stock-taking exercise conducted with competent authorities about their national regulatory law/regulations and supervisory practices and a mapping of the TCBs established in the Member States. Considering the increased volume of activities carried out by TCBs in a context of regulatory fragmentation across the EU, the Report lays down 14 high-level policy recommendations for further harmonisation of EU law. The recommendations focus on EU centralised equivalence assessment; effective cooperation supported by the conclusion of MoUs with third country home authorities; an appropriately determined scope of authorisation and prudential requirements (notably capital, liquidity, internal governance including booking arrangements); certain AML/CFT aspects; a uniform minimum reporting framework; and satisfactory recovery plans. The recommendations also introduce a subsidiarisation mechanism as risk prevention and mitigation measure. This mechanism should apply to TCBs reaching a certain size and/or other quantitative and qualitative risk indicators, as well as to TCBs carrying out deposit-taking activity of covered deposits. The identification and calibration of the relevant thresholds should be based on an impact assessment. The EBA highlighted the importance of a continuous supervisory dialogue with the TCB and third country credit institution, and of an effective mutual cooperation with the third country home authority. Such cooperation is crucial for devising potential mitigation measures that could ensure a safe and sound prudential management of the third country branch activities and associated risks. In this context, the EBA has carefully considered the interaction with the framework relating to the intermediate parent undertaking (IPU). As a matter of fact, while assets held by TCBs are computed to determine whether an IPU needs to be established, the TCB itself is not included within the IPU consolidated perimeter. Legal basis The Report is based on Article 21b(10) of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), which mandates the Authority to submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the treatment of third-country branches under national law of the Member States by 28 June 2021. In this Report the EBA shall consider the following: whether and to what extent supervisory practices under national law for third country branches differ between Member States; whether different treatment of third country branches could result in regulatory arbitrage; whether further harmonisation of national regimes for third country branches would be necessary and appropriate, especially with regard to significant third country branches.

It is also proposing changes to COREP securitisation and G-SII reporting. The proposals are a step forward in the implementation of the EBA\u2019s cost reduction measures included in its study on the cost of compliance with supervisory reporting requirements. The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation to amend its Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on Supervisory Reporting with regards to COREP and asset encumbrance reporting as well as the reporting for the purposes of identifying global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs). Among others, this consultation paper aims to enhance proportionality in the area of asset encumbrance reporting, as recommended by the EBA\u2019s Report on the Study on the Cost of compliance with supervisory reporting requirements (CoC report). The consultation runs until 23 September 2021. In response to the Capital Markets Recovery Package (CMRP), the reporting on securitisations needs to be amended to keep it aligned with the prudential requirements. Furthermore, the EBA is proposing some minor amendments to COREP (reporting on own funds and own funds requirements) in order to obtain a deeper understanding of institution\u2019s use of the option to exempt certain software assets from the deduction from own funds. Following the proposals for enhanced proportionality on asset encumbrance reporting, small and non-complex institutions will be exempted from the reporting of more granular data, as proposed in the CoC report. Besides that, this consultation paper suggests changing the definition of the level of asset encumbrance. Regarding the reporting of information for determining G-SIIs and assigning G-SII buffer rates, the EBA is proposing to slightly expand the scope of application of the reporting obligation, to include standalone entities, and not only banking groups, that meet the relevant criteria.

This progress coincided with a significant reduction of the volume and value of fraud, for the same type of transactions and the same time period. Payment service providers (PSPs) in some jurisdictions are still lagging behind on some indicators. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a Report on the data provided by PSPs on their readiness to apply SCA for the subset of payment transactions that are e-commerce card-based payment transactions. The Report highlights the status of issuing and acquiring PSPs in enrolling online merchants, payment cards and payment service users (PSUs) into SCA-compliant solutions, and in requesting SCA for online payment transactions after 31 December 2020, when the SCA migration period ended. The EBA tracked the progress made by issuing and acquiring PSPs from September 2019 to April 2021 by monitoring a number of indicators that had been set out in the EBA Opinion of 2019 on the deadline for the migration to SCA compliance for e-commerce card-based payment transactions. Based on the data collected from those PSPs, the EBA observed that significant progress has been made with regard to SCA -compliance, as highlighted by the following key indicators: 99% of EU merchants are able to support SCA; 94% of all payment cards in the EU are SCA-enabled; 82% of all PSUs are enrolled into an SCA solution; 92% of e-commerce card-based authentication requests reported by acquirers are compliant with the SCA requirements; and 87% of initiated e-commerce card-based payment transactions reported by issuers are compliant with the SCA requirements. This progress also coincided with a significant reduction of the volume and value of fraudulent e-commerce card-based payment transactions in the EU over the same period. Finally, the Report notes that there are still PSPs in some jurisdictions that are lagging behind others in enabling SCA on their payment cards, enrolling PSUs to SCA-compliant authentication solutions or initiating SCA-compliant transactions. Legal basis and background The regulatory technical standards (RTS) on SCA and common and secure communication (CSC) underpin the new security requirements under the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and have applied since 14 September 2019. These requirements were introduced to decrease the risk of payment fraud and to ensure the safety of payment service users\u2019 funds and personal data. In June 2019, with its Opinion on the SCA elements (EBA-Op-2019-06), the EBA granted, on an exceptional basis, supervisory flexibility for national competent authorities (NCAs), not to enforce the RTS on SCA&CSC to allow issuing and acquiring PSPs to migrate to SCA-compliant approaches and solutions for e-commerce card-based payment transactions. The Opinion on the deadline for the migration to SCA compliance for e-commerce card-based payment transactions (EBA-Op-2019-11) set the deadline for said supervisory flexibility to 31 December 2020 and set out the actions to be taken by NCAs, as well as by issuing and acquiring PSPs, during that period.\u00a0 The Opinion also envisaged for the EBA to develop a Report on the status of SCA-compliance by issuing and acquiring PSPs based on consolidated information provided from PSPs through their NCAs.

The amendments reflect: the recognition of two new credit rating agencies (CRAs); the outcome of a monitoring exercise on the adequacy of existing mappings; and the deregistration of a number of CRAs. The ITS are part of the EU Single Rulebook for banking and insurance aimed at creating a safe and sound regulatory framework consistently applicable across the European Union (EU). Since the adoption in 2019 of the ITS on the mapping of credit assessments of ECAIs, two additional CRAs have been recognised and a number of CRAs have ben de-registered. The ITS have therefore, been amended to reflect the allocation of appropriate risk weights to the newly established ECAIs, and to remove the reference to the de-registered ECAIs. Furthermore, the amendments reflect the outcome of a monitoring exercise on the adequacy of the existing mappings, based on the additional quantitative and qualitative information collected after the original Implementing Regulation entered into force. In particular, the ESAs propose to change the Credit Quality Step (CQS) allocation for two ECAIs, and to introduce new credit rating scales for nine ECAIs. The ESAs also published individual draft mapping reports illustrating how the methodology was applied to produce the amended mappings, in line with the mandate from the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). Legal Basis and background The proposed revised draft ITSs have been developed according to Article 136 (1) and (3) of Regulation 575/2013 (CRR) and of Article 109 (a) of Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II Directive), which state that revised draft ITS\u00a0 shall be submitted by the ESAs, where necessary.

The revised Guidelines optimise and simplify the reporting process and templates, focus on incidents with significant impact on payment service providers (PSPs), and improve the meaningfulness of the information to be reported. The revised Guidelines are also estimated to reduce the reporting burden for PSPs. In accordance with PSD2, PSPs are required to report to the competent authority in their home Member State major operational or security incidents, which have or are likely to have an adverse impact on the provision of payment services. These revised Guidelines introduce changes to some of the original classification criteria and introduce a new criterion on the breach of security of network or information systems, which, following the feedback from the public consultation, was narrowed down in scope from \u2018breach of security measures\u2019, as originally proposed. This new criterion focuses on malicious actions that have compromised network or information systems related to the provision of payment services and it would allow the reporting of additional security incidents that would be of interest to supervisors. To reduce the reporting burden on PSPs, the EBA removed unnecessary steps from the reporting process and allowed more time for the submission of the final report. The EBA also simplified and optimised the standardised reporting template. These changes are estimated to result in a reduction of the reportable incidents by more than 10% and to facilitate PSPs in their reporting of major incidents. The Guidelines will apply as of 1 January 2022. Legal basis and background Article 96(3) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on Payment Services in the Internal Market (PSD2) confers on the European Banking Authority (EBA) the mandate to develop, in close cooperation with the European Central Bank (ECB), Guidelines addressed to payment service providers on the classification and notification of major operational or security incidents, and to competent authorities on the criteria to assess their relevance and the details to be shared with other domestic authorities. Article 96(4) of PSD2, in turn, requires the EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, to review the Guidelines on a regular basis and in any event at least every 2 years. The original Guidelines on major incident reporting were developed in 2017 in close cooperation with the European Central Bank (ECB) and have applied since January 2018. The EBA launched the review of the Guidelines in 2020 by assessing the reports it had received by then. The EBA acknowledges the ongoing negotiations of the EU Commission\u2019s proposal for an EU regulatory framework on digital operational resilience (DORA), which contains, inter alia, a proposal to harmonise and streamline the reporting of ICT-related incidents, not only for payment services but across the entire EU finance sector. The EBA will continue monitoring these negotiations. Depending on their outcome, the EBA Guidelines may eventually be repealed and replaced with the DORA Regulation, which is currently estimated to apply from 2024.

These recommendations could further improve the proportionality that already exists in the supervisory reporting, generating savings to small and non-complex institutions of up to EUR 188-288 million. The EBA will be implementing these recommendations, as part of its ongoing work on proportionality in the common EU supervisory reporting framework. As part of its drive for more proportionate regulatory and supervisory framework, the European Banking Authority (EBA) has finalised its comprehensive study of the cost of compliance of European Economic Area (EEA) banks with the supervisory reporting requirements. In the summary report published today, the EBA has identified numerous recommendations collectively leading to a potential reduction of the banks\u2019 reporting costs by up to 15-24%. Most of the recommendations will be implemented by the EBA as part of its ongoing policy work on developing and enhancing the common EU supervisory reporting framework. The cost of compliance study focuses on three main aspects. First, it tries to\u00a0 understand the actual reporting costs incurred by the EEA banks in relation to supervisory reporting, and in particular in relation to the EBA implementing technical standards (ITS) on Supervisory Reporting. Second, it assesses the effects of a reduction of some specific reporting requirements on reporting costs and supervisory effectiveness. Third, it assesses whether the reporting costs were proportionate with regard to the benefits delivered. In the report the EBA also looked at the classification of the EEA banks into various proportionality categories introduced in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). In the report the EBA identifies 25 recommendations aimed at reducing the costs of compliance with supervisory reporting requirements focusing primarily on small and non-complex institutions. However, the recommendations will improve reporting requirements and processes for all institutions whilst retaining the end-user benefits of the single supervisory framework. The recommendations address four broad areas: changes to the development process for the EBA reporting framework; changes to the design of EBA supervisory reporting requirements and reporting content; coordination and integration of data requests and reporting requirements; changes to the reporting process, including the wider use of technology. The study also identified the need to remove barrier to the wider adoption by institutions of FinTech and RegTech solutions as well as to promote better digitalisation of the institutions\u2019 internal documents and contracts.\u00a0 This is particularly relevant for small and non-complex institutions. The EBA will incorporate the recommendations into its work programme and implement them as part of the ongoing work, according to the availability of internal resources. Certain recommendations would lead to specific policy products that will follow the usual policy development process, which includes seeking industry and other stakeholders\u2019 views through the public consultation process. The EBA will also continue its work on making the reporting process more efficient for all stakeholder through its work on the feasibility study of integrated reporting (more information available here). Legal basis and background The EBA is mandated by Article 430(8) of the CRR to measure the costs institutions incur when complying with the reporting requirements set out in the EBA\u2019s ITS on supervisory reporting. Such reporting costs should be assessed since the introduction of the common supervisory reporting in the EU in 2013. The EBA is also asked to assess whether these reporting costs are proportionate with regard to the benefits delivered for the purposes of prudential supervision and make recommendations on how to reduce the reporting cost at least for small and non-complex institutions. The analysis draws on significant input from and interaction with the industry. The EBA sent voluntary quantitative and qualitative questionnaires to all EEA credit institutions. The EBA interviewed various industry trade bodies and small and non-complex institutions across several Member States. The EBA also received voluntary case studies from various stakeholders that have been used in the analysis. Users of supervisory reporting, in particular supervisory authorities, also provided information to inform the analysis. As part of the recommendations, the EBA also considered streamlining liquidity reporting (additional liquidity monitoring metrics) and exempting small and non-complex institutions from reporting certain templates, introducing changes to reporting large exposures, leverage ratio and net stable funding ratio, improving and further simplifying the reporting on asset encumbrance, better signposting of the regulatory and reporting requirements, introducing better articulation, explanation and providing examples in the ITS on supervisory reporting, and seeking greater coordination between the authorities in their ad hoc information requests.

The identification of large investment firms, which will be subject to the application of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), depends on the size of the investment firms and of the groups they belong to. Based on the feedback received in the first consultation, which the EBA launched on 4 June 2020, concerns were raised on the level playing field between undertakings, which are part of groups domiciled in the EU and undertakings operating in the EU, which are part of groups domiciled outside of the EU. The amended proposals included in this consultation aim at ensuring that the framework is neutral with regards to geographical limitations. These draft RTS set out a proportionate and technically consistent methodology for the calculation of the level of total assets to be compared to the EUR 30 bn threshold and further clarify the notion of relevant entity.

The draft Regulatory Technical Standards also specify the policies, procedures and organisational arrangements that crowdfunding service providers shall have in place in relation to any contingency fund they may offer to investors. The consultation runs until 4 September 2021. In order to reduce the information asymmetry between crowdfunding service providers and investors, as well as to ensure transparency and adequate protection for investors, the latter should have access to all relevant information about the composition of the portfolio, including the projects where their funds are invested, as well as the quality of the loans financing these projects. Investors are exposed not only to risks connected to the projects or the loans in which their funds are invested, but also to the way the crowdfunding service provider assesses the risk of these loans and projects and how it manages the selection of loans for the portfolio. Against this backdrop, these draft RTS require crowdfunding service providers to show that the measurement techniques used for credit risk assessments are based on a sufficient number of elements and are appropriate to the complexity and level of the risks underlying i) the single projects; ii) the portfolio; iii) the project owners. In addition, the draft RTS set out the information that crowdfunding platforms must disclose referring to several key characteristics of each loan included in a certain portfolio. Finally, as crowdfunding service providers may offer a dedicated contingency fund to compensate investors for the losses they may incur, in case project owners do not reimburse their loans, the draft RTS specify adequate policies, procedures and governance arrangements that providers should have in place when managing, either directly or through a third party provider, contingency funds.

It has been also an exceptional year due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced changes and challenges to the operational and policy work of the EBA. The Annual Report presents the ad-hoc activities the EBA undertook to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the EU banking sector. In particular, the EBA put in place prudential and supervisory measures to support bank lending into the real economy by publishing Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria on loan repayments, as well as Guidelines on reporting and disclosure of exposures subject to measures applied in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The EBA also focused on assessing and monitoring the evolution of risks and enhancing transparency. Although it deemed necessary to postpone the 2020 EU-wide Stress Test, it carried out an additional Transparency Exercise to provide updated information on banks\u2019 exposures and asset quality to market participants. Similarly, the COVID-19 outbreak also triggered the publication of an ad-hoc impact study on the implementation of Basel III in the EU. The Authority also addressed the issue of consumer protection in the area of payments and financial crime risks in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite all the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the EBA delivered on its key mandates and executed most of its 2020 Work Programme. The EBA continued monitoring the implementation of Basel III global standards to ensure the safe and smooth functioning of the EU banking system. It also advanced on its work on enhancing transparency in data and took steps towards becoming an integrated data hub. In 2020, the EBA also focused on new and upcoming areas such as anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), sustainable finance and digital innovation. The 2020 Annual Report also lies down the strategic priorities area for 2021, which include the review of the stress-testing framework, implementation of the mandates in the domain of AML/CFT, financial innovation and sustainable finance.

The measure intends to tighten, for French global or other systemically important institutions, the large-exposure limits applicable to large and highly indebted non-financial corporations (NFCs) or groups of connected NFCs assessed to be highly indebted. Based on the evidence submitted, the EBA does not object to the extension of the proposed measure, which will be applied for two years from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2023. With the application of this measure, French systemically important institutions should not have individual exposures exceeding 5% of their Tier 1 capital for NFCs or for groups of connected NFCs assessed to be highly indebted and resident in France. The 5% limit will act as a backstop to safeguard these institutions from excessive risk-taking and prevent the build-up of future vulnerabilities. In its Opinion, addressed to the Council, the European Commission and the French Authorities, the EBA acknowledged that the measure helps promote financial stability and prevent future systemic shocks to the French and EU economies by shielding individual systemically important lenders from idiosyncratic corporate defaults. In light of the increase in corporate indebtedness following the COVID-19 pandemic, the EBA encourages the French authorities to monitor closely the developments during the application horizon of the measure and to be vigilant about any unintended consequences on credit supply. Background In its Opinions issued on\u00a013 March 2018 and 20 May 2020, the EBA did not object to the initial adoption and the first extension of this measure, taking into consideration the measure\u2019s objectives of resilience (limiting concentration risks) and prevention (intensifying the vigilance about high leverage of NFCs).

The updated ITS include all benchmarking portfolios and metrics that will be used for the 2022 exercise. The benchmarking exercise is an essential supervisory tool to enhance the quality of internal models, which is particularly important in a stressed economic situation. The exercise covers approved internal approaches used for own funds requirements calculation of credit and market risk, as well as internal models used for IFRS9. For the market risk benchmarking, the framework is extended to allow the collection of new information, in particular as regards sensitivity-based-measures (SBM), in relation to the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) SBM measures for own funds requirements. \u00a0This will ensure the exercise is updated with respect to the Regulation in place. In addition, some instruments have been updated and clarified, while the overall composition of the portfolio has marginally changed with respect to the 2021 exercise. For credit risk, a limited number of additional data fields was added to understand the level of conservatism incorporated in the risk estimates and the resulting risk weighted exposures amounts. In addition, some enhancements were made regarding the existing data requirements. For the IFRS9 portfolios, a limited number of additional data fields has been included to collect information on additional IFRS 9 parameters, in particular the Loss Given Default (LGD). This is in line with the staggered approach communicated in the EBA IFRS 9 roadmap published in July 2019. In addition, the update includes changes and clarifications that the EBA introduced based on the Consultation Paper that was published on 17 December 2020. Finally, the EBA believes that under the current circumstances, the usefulness of this exercise has increased.

The Report highlights the key challenges faced by supervisors in the application of the current regulatory framework on the EIMs and various options for addressing them. The Report \u00a0follows the Discussion Paper launched in June 2020 to explore ways of enhancing crisis management tools available for competent authorities in addition to well-established and widely used supervisory powers laid down in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and in the Single Supervisory Mechanism Regulation (SSMR). \u00a0\u00a0 The BRRD introduced early intervention measures (EIMs) to expand the existing set of powers available to supervisors when institutions are experiencing difficulties. The EBA monitored the application of EIMs in 2015-2018 and observed their limited use across the European Union. Instead of resorting to EIMs, competent authorities often preferred to apply other pre-BRRD supervisory powers available to them. The EBA investigated the reasons for these supervisory practices and in June 2020, published a Discussion Paper including its preliminary findings on the most important implementation issues in the area of EIMs and possible solutions on how to address them. The Report published today concludes the EBA\u2019s work on EIMs and also provides an overview of the feedback received from public consultations as well as the EBA conclusions. Key conclusions and next steps The EBA observed supervisory consensus on the need to eliminate existing overlaps between EIMs and other supervisory powers, as well as to remove the formal sequencing of EIMs specified in Articles 27-29 of the BRRD. In addition, the EBA observed that competent authorities supported the importance of amending Article 27(1) of the BRRD that includes an example of a quantitative early intervention trigger. For early intervention triggers specified in regulatory technical standards (e.g. based on SREP scores or monitoring of key risk indicators), the EBA will conduct further work and amend its current Guidelines on the EI triggers upon finalisation of the ongoing review of the BRRD. Legal basis and background The EBA has drafted this discussion paper and report on early intervention in accordance with Article 27(5) of the BRRD in relation to the monitoring of the application of the EBA Guidelines on early intervention triggers (EBA/GL/2015/03). The DP on EIMs brought the key challenges in the implementation of the EIMs framework to the attention of the EU legislators and the European Commission is currently working on revising the existing BRRD provisions on EIMs. Documents Report on the application of early intervention measures in the EU ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-issues-report-application-brrd-early-intervention-framework"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0061", "date": "2021-05-27", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA provides a comparison of provisioning in the United States and the European Union in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic", "text": " The cost of risk (CoR) of EU banks rose from 0.45% in December 2019 to 0.82% in June 2020 while the CoR of US banks jumped from 0.54% to 2.16% in the same period. Differences in the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic across the two regions, in the loan portfolio composition of US and EU banks and in accounting frameworks for the recognition of expected credit losses (ECL) help explain the different evolution of the CoR. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a thematic note comparing provisioning practices in the US and the EU during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The note looks into the differences in the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic, in banks\u2019 loan portfolios, and in accounting rules that might explain why the CoR of US banks was much higher compared to their EU peers in the first half of 2020 and fell at a faster pace afterwards. Looking at data over the past 13 years, following an economic shock, loan loss provisions of EU banks tend to be less volatile than those of US banks. In a similar vein, in the first two quarters of 2020, the CoR of US banks was much higher compared to EU banks. However, in the second half of 2020, the CoR of US banks fell more rapidly compared to their EU peers. The impact of the pandemic on macroeconomic variables helps explain some of the differences in CoR. The US suffered a higher increase in unemployment in the early stages of the pandemic that might contribute to the sharper rise in CoR compared to EU banks. Similarly, a faster economic recovery in the US might explain the faster fall in the second half of 2020. A preliminary analysis also reveals a riskier loan portfolio composition of US banks. The share of the portfolios potentially more affected by social distancing and containment measures such as commercial real estate or consumer credit over total loans granted is higher in the US. This could be a further explanation for the higher CoR at the onset of the pandemic. Different accounting rules can also lead to differences in CoR. Under CECL, banks recognise lifetime ECL for all financial assets whereas under IFRS 9 the 12-month ECL is recognised for Stage 1 loans. At the onset of a crisis, the IFRS 9 impairment model presumably resulted in a rise in CoR because of loan migrations from Stage 1 to Stages 2 or 3, for which lifetime ECL were recognised. However, this effect seems to be less material than the impact of applying the CECL approach to all financial assets. Notes to editors To ensure comparability between EU and US data, the CoR figures provided in this note do not include the amounts written off directly to the statement of profit or loss. Thus, they could differ from the CoR figures provided in other EBA publications such as the Risk Dashboard or the Risk Assessment Report.

Cooperation and information exchange is key to ensuring the prudential soundness and viability of institutions, to protecting the EU\u2019s financial system from financial crime and to safeguarding its stability and integrity. This consultation runs until 27 August 2021. In accordance with Article 117(5) of the CRD, prudential supervisors, AML/CFT supervisors and financial intelligence units (FIUs) must cooperate closely within their respective competences and provide each other with information relevant for their respective tasks. These Guidelines put in place the practical modalities of cooperation and information exchange among prudential supervisors, AML/CFT supervisors and FIUs, both at the level of Member States, and across the EU\u2019s Single Market. The Guidelines facilitate and support the cooperation and information exchange throughout the supervisory life cycle covering authorisations of new institutions, on-going supervision including the risk assessment, and, where relevant, the imposition of supervisory measures and sanctions, including the withdrawal of the authorisation. In particular, the Guidelines help authorities exchange information in a more effective way and bring clarity on which information to exchange with whom and at what stage. While each authority has its own role and responsibilities in the fight against ML/TF, there are areas where their tasks complement each other and therefore effective cooperation and information exchange among them is essential to identify, address and mitigate ML/TF risks. Such effective cooperation and information exchange is essential to ensure the prudential soundness and viability of institutions and the stability of the financial system as a whole. These Guidelines complement the\u00a0ESAs\u2019 AML/CFT Colleges Guidelines, which were published in 2019 and form part of the EBA's wider work to strengthen the link between prudential and AML/CFT supervision.

The Report shows that as of December 2019, the largest institutions have made good progress in reducing MREL shortfalls and that smaller institutions tend to lag behind. This Report reflects existing MREL policies applicable as at December 2019 and estimates the impact of BRRD II only for global systemically important institutions (GSIIs) and top-tier banks via the subordination levels. An estimated 80% of the EU\u2019s domestic assets are covered by a strategy other than liquidation \u2013stable compared to 80% last year on a comparable basis. the number of decision has increased, thus reflecting the continued progress by resolution authorities in agreeing on resolution strategies and setting MREL, but also highlights the fact that more than six years after the adoption of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), authorities are still in the process of rolling-out resolution strategies and MREL requirements. As at December 2019, out of the 238 resolution groups captured in this Report, 111 EU resolution groups showed an MREL shortfall estimated at EUR 102 bn, down from EUR 172 bn as of December 2018. In terms of total assets, institutions with a shortfall represent about 28% of EU total domestic assets. Note to the editors The Report is based on data as of 31 December 2019 provided by resolution authorities and covers the actual population of banks covered by an MREL decision, the actual level of this requirement and the level of resources effectively eligible in the relevant jurisdictions. BRRD II was adopted in July 2019 and resolution authorities have now started to take new decisions reflecting the revised framework. These decisions will be reported to the EBA starting as of 31 May 2021 and the EBA will update on the progress by year-end.

Since their entry into force, the RTS on own funds have significantly enhanced regulatory harmonisation of prudential rules and contributed to strengthening the quality of regulatory capital. With the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) introducing new criteria and requirements for eligible liabilities, these amended RTS capture several aspects of eligible liabilities as well as the changes to the own funds framework. The draft RTS align existing provisions to changes introduced in the revised CRR in the area of own funds. This is the case, in particular, for provisions relating to the regime of supervisory prior permission for the reduction of own funds. In addition, the draft RTS specify some of the newly introduced criteria for eligible liabilities instruments derived from the own funds regime. These include the absence of direct or indirect funding for the acquisition of ownership of eligible liabilities, the absence of incentives to redeem, the need for the resolution authority\u2019s prior permission for the reduction of eligible liabilities. For some of these aspects, the mandates attributed to the EBA explicitly require to ensure full alignment between eligible liabilities and own funds. Following the feedback received during the public consultation, the calibration of the threshold for determining the predetermined amount for the general prior permission for reducing eligible liabilities instruments was increased from 3% to 10% of the total amount of outstanding eligible liabilities instruments. Moreover, the final draft RTS have been revised in order to recognise some relief for the renewal of general prior permission both for own funds and eligible liabilities and for introducing a proportionate approach for liquidation entities for which their minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) does not exceed the loss absorption amount. Legal basis and background The EBA has updated the RTS on own funds, in accordance with the original RTS mandates granted to the EBA under Articles 28(5), 29(6), 52(2), 76(4), 78(5) and 79(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (\u2018CRR\u2019).

The findings give a clear picture of banks\u2019 data gaps and highlight the sense of urgency to remedy them if they are to achieve a meaningful and smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. It is only through a more harmonised approach and common metrics that banks\u2019 efforts will prove meaningful in addressing and mitigating the potentially disruptive impacts of environmental risks. The findings also show big differences in banks\u2019 application of the EU taxonomy. A first estimate of the starting point of their green asset ratio (GAR) estimated with a top-down tool currently stands at 7.9%. Summary of key results Overall, the findings show that more disclosure on transition strategies and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would be needed to allow banks and supervisors to assess climate risk more accurately. In addition, the results highlight the importance for banks to expand their data infrastructure to include clients\u2019 information at activity level. This is particularly crucial as for the 29 banks in the sample, more than half of their exposures to non-SME corporates (58% of total) are allocated to sectors that might be sensitive to transition risk. A parallel analysis, based on GHG emissions, reveals that 35% of banks\u2019 total submitted exposures are towards EU obligors with GHG emissions above the median of the distribution. Banks\u2019 disclosures will be reinforced following the EBA draft technical standards on Pillar 3 disclosures on climate-change and ESG related risks, including the definition of the green asset ratio (GAR), currently under consultation[1], which will allow stakeholders to assess bank\u2019s ESG related risks and sustainability strategy[2] and to promote market discipline. Regarding the EU taxonomy classification, banks are currently in different development phases to assess the greenness of their exposures. Two estimation techniques, banks\u2019 bottom-up estimates and a top-down tool, are considered in the exercise and the report highlights the differences in outcomes. Given the outlined constraints and based on a first estimate coming from a top down tool, an EU aggregated GAR stands at 7.9%. The scenario analysis shows that the impact of climate-related risks across banks has different magnitudes and is concentrated in some particular sectors. Tools for scenario analysis are quickly developing and further progress should be made on modelling the transmission channels of climate risk shocks to banks\u2019 balance sheets.\u00a0 Despite the appreciated efforts made by the volunteer banks in the sample, given the data gaps and the various approaches used, the findings presented in the Report should be considered as starting point estimates for future work on climate risk. The EBA will continue to work actively on measuring and assessing climate related risks in the banking sector and these findings are a key starting point in view of building up consistent and comparable climate risk assessment tools, which will help banks quantify the amount of exposures that might require managerial attention from a transition perspective. Notes to the editors The EU-wide pilot exercise was run by EBA on a sample of 29 volunteer banks from 10 countries, \u00a0representing 50% of the EU banking sector\u2019s total assets, which provided raw data on non-SME corporate exposures to EU domiciled obligors[3]. The exercise focused on the identification and quantification of exposures from a climate perspective, in particular, on transition risk. The scope of the exercise is narrowed to EU corporate exposures, for which climate related information are expected to be easier to retrieve at this stage. Banks\u2019 exposures were mapped and evaluated according to different classification approaches, including the EU taxonomy. The latter was applied by banks directly and complemented with a top-down classification tool run by the EBA. Finally, a scenario analysis based on a joint EBA/ECB tool was also used to explore modelling options regarding the transmission mechanism between the shocks coming from climate risk scenarios, as defined by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and banks\u2019 balance sheets. \u00a0\r \t [1]https://www.eba.europa.eu/implementing-technical-standards-its-prudential-disclosures-esg-risks-accordance-article-449a-crr [2] https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-launches-public-consultation-draft-technical-standards-pillar-3-disclosures-esg-risks [3] Exposures to obligors located in Norway and United Kingdom are also included in the analysis.

The Report is meant to provide guidance to the European Commission in the context of its review of the functioning of the SECR. It also provides initial inputs to the ongoing discussion on the efficiency of the securitisation framework given the role that securitisation could play in the recovery post the Covid-19 pandemic. The SECR, which became applicable in January 2019, has been useful in increasing the overall soundness of the EU securitisation market and in reducing the stigma of securitisation products. However, some adjustments could be considered to further improve the overall consistency of the existing framework. In particular, the Report highlights: Transparency requirements: given the trend in increasing issuances of private securitisations and considering the SECR objectives of access of information and investor protection, a more precise legal definition for private securitisations should be specified in the SECR in order to clearly identify private securitisations that should comply with the transparency requirements. Data reported for those private securitisations should also be made available by means of a securitisation repository in order to ensure high quality data and facilitate the supervision of the compliance with the transparency requirements. Due diligence requirements: regulatory guidance would be useful to specify how proportionality could be implemented in the area of due-diligence to facilitate entrance of new investors in the EU securitisation market. Criteria for simple, transparent and standardised (STS) securitisation: targeted amendments in the STS criteria would be needed to facilitate the use of the STS label for ABCP programmes. In addition, in the medium term, as more STS issuances are executed and the STS market reaches a stable pace, further analysis should be performed by the European Commission with ESAs\u2019 support to determine how the STS criteria could be simplified without reducing the quality of the standard. Supervision of securitisation requirements: in order to further enhance the supervision of securitisation requirements, it is deemed necessary to explore i) how to develop common EU supervisory tools, ii) potential alternatives to the current STS supervisory framework, in particular for those jurisdictions with limited STS securitisation issuances and, iii) the relevance of a common EU approach to the ongoing supervision of authorisation conditions for third-party verifiers (TPVs). Legal Basis This Report has been developed in accordance with Article 44 of the SECR (Reg. EU 2017/2402) which requires that the JC of ESAs delivers a first report on the implementation and the functioning of the SECR by January 2021. In accordance with the mandate, the analysis focuses on the implementation of the general requirements applicable to all securitisations, including the risk retention, due-diligence and transparency requirements as well as on the specific requirements related to STS securitisations. The Report also includes further analysis to cover material risks and new vulnerabilities that may have materialised.

Based on a survey among EU banking supervisors, no mechanistic reliance on external credit ratings was identified. Furthermore, using EBA supervisory reporting data, the Report shows that the use of external credit ratings in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts (RWEA) under the standardised approach, and under the External Ratings Based Approach (SEC-ERBA) of the securitisation framework is limited. The EBA\u2019s assessment will ensure a comprehensive overview of the reliance on ratings for regulatory purposes ahead of the implementation of Basel III reforms into the EU legislative framework. Based on the quantitative evidence collected, the EBA recommends to remove the mandate laid down in Article 161 (3) of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) to publish bi-annually a Report on the extent to which Member State\u2019s law refers to external credit ratings, and how Competent Authorities are encouraging internal credit risk assessment capacity, promoting internal models for own funds requirements, and reducing reliance on external credit ratings . The recommendation is made on the basis of the limited references to external credit ratings found in Member States\u2019 national law, together with developments in international regulation, namely \u00a0the provisions to reduce mechanistic reliance on external credit ratings in the standardised approach of the credit risk framework in the final Basel III reforms, and in the new securitisation framework introduced in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). In addition, the Report stresses that the \u201cenhanced due diligence\u201d introduced in the final Basel III framework should be implemented in the EU framework. To collect the relevant information, in December 2020, the EBA launched a survey among EU banking supervisors, which showed that Member States\u2019 national law does not introduce mechanistic references to external credit ratings, and that the CRD-related requirements to reduce reliance have been transposed into national legislation. Legal basis The Report has been developed in accordance with Article 161 (3) of the CRD, which requires the EBA to analyse the extent to which Member States' national law refers to external credit ratings and how Competent Authorities are encouraging internal credit risk assessment capacity, promoting internal models for own funds requirements whenever proportional, and reducing reliance on external credit ratings.

Notwithstanding a refocusing of supervisory practices towards the areas impacted by the COVID 19 crisis, in line with the EBA Guidelines\u00a0\u00a0on the pragmatic 2020 supervisory review and evaluation process in light of the COVID\u201019 crisis, overall, the Report finds that supervisors converged in using the key topics of the EBA 2020 Convergence Plan in their supervisory work in 2020 and good progress in supervisors\u2019 efforts could be achieved across the EU.\u00a0 The Report forms part of the EBA\u2019s work to actively foster and promote supervisory convergence across the Union and ensure the consistent, efficient and effective application of the Union law. The EBA actively drives the convergence efforts by establishing the annual Convergence Plan, the implementation of which is then followed up by the EBA, together with other aspects of the supervisory review process. Overall, the Report finds that in 2020, increased supervisory attention was given to the assessment of profitability and the business model (closely linked to asset quality), as well as to selected areas of ICT risk and operational resilience, while the loan origination key topic received less supervisory attention as COVID-19 shifted the focus within the \u2018life cycle\u2019 from loan origination to the management of distressed debtors and to the monitoring of risk exposures. Therefore, loan origination practices should remain an area of attention for supervisors in 2021 and onwards. The EBA also observed continued efforts by competent authorities to cooperate with their resolution authority counterparts and prudential supervisory practices have also been converging in the context of money laundering and terrorist financing risk. Nevertheless, some differences remain in supervisory practices both in the context of the Convergence Plan as well as in the broader Pillar 2 framework, affecting the setting of Pillar 2 Requirements and Pillar 2 Guidance.\u00a0 Another key element of the Report is the convergence in supervisory colleges, where the EBA observed increased interaction in 2020, compared to 2019, due to the close cooperation among college members during the pandemic and the colleges definitely becoming the natural platform for exchanges when it comes to cross-border banks. Under \u00a0the 2021 Convergence Plan, the EBA also published four key topics, which in 2021 will require heightened supervisory attention: i) asset quality and credit risk management; ii) ICT and security risk, operational resilience; iii) profitability and business model; and iv) capital and liability management. The selection of these key areas for 2021 were primarily driven by the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic while they also ensure continuity in other areas to enhance supervisory efforts towards further convergence. Note to the editors According to its founding regulation, the EBA shall contribute to enhancing supervisory convergence across the internal market and building a common supervisory culture. Specifically in the context of the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), the EBA is mandated to annually report to the European Parliament and the Council on the degree of convergence of the application of the supervisory review as mandated by Article 107 of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD).

The EBA publishes this data on a yearly basis to enhance the transparency and public accountability of deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) across the European Economic Area (EEA) to the benefit of depositors, markets, policymakers, DGSs and Members States. AFM is the amount of funds raised by DGSs from credit institutions and its main purpose is to reimburse depositors in case of bank failures. The data as of 31 December 2020 shows that 34 of 36 DGSs in EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway had increased their funds since the previous year by more than 12%*. In general, the increase stems from levies paid by banks that are members of those DGSs. In some cases, a significant increase in AFM in 2020 was the result of the DGS receiving recoveries from a previous intervention. In other instances, DGSs experienced a significant drop in AFM following bank failures where they had to use their AFM to reimburse depositors. Covered deposits, in turn, are guaranteed up to 100,000 Euro or the equivalent in other currencies per depositor at each bank. In 2020, they increased significantly throughout the European Economic Area, reaching a year on year growth rate of 8.6%*, which is twice the annual growth rate for the period from 2015-2019 of 4.3%*. About half the DGSs even saw double-digit growth rates of the covered deposits they protect. The increase could be a consequence of the global COVID-19 pandemic as households may have delayed purchases due to commercial restrictions or sought to store their savings safely. Changes in the AFM and covered deposits are relevant, because the ratio of AFM to covered deposits is the measurement for the target level of 0.8% of covered deposits set out in the DGSD, which the DGSs needs to reach by 3 July 2024. As of 31 December 2020, 18 DGSs have already reached the target level while 16 DGSs have yet to reach it. The above-average increases in covered deposits mean that the ratio of AFM to covered deposits increased by less than it would have otherwise. The consequence might be that the DGS contributions might need to be higher in the coming years, particularly where the DGS has not yet reached the target level of 0.8% of AFM to covered deposits. Legal basis and background The EBA is collecting this data in accordance with Article 10(10) of the DGSD. On 23 July 2018, the EBA issued a decision to explain that it will make this data publicly available on its website. \u00a0 (*) The growth rates in this press release are measured based on the aggregate for the EU 27, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway in Euros at constant exchange rates as of 31 December 2019. \u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-updates-data-deposit-guarantee-schemes-across-eea"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0074", "date": "2021-05-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The EBA consults on its proposals for a central AML/CFT database", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on a central database on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) in the EU. This database will be a key tool for the EBA\u2019s recently enhanced mandate to lead, coordinate and monitor AML/CFT efforts in the European Union. The consultation runs until\u00a017\u00a0June 2021.\u00a0 The revised EBA Regulation that came into effect in January 2020 requires the EBA to establish and keep up to date a central database with information on AML/CFT weaknesses that competent authorities (CAs) across the EU have identified in respect of individual financial institutions. The database will also contain information on the measures competent authorities have taken to rectify those material AML/CFT weaknesses. Information from this database will be used by individual competent authorities and the EBA to make the fight against ML/TF in the EU more targeted and effective in the future. The draft RTS proposed in this Consultation Paper specify the definition and the materiality of weaknesses identified by competent authorities, the type of information collected, and how such information will be communicated to the EBA. It also sets out how the EBA will analyse and disseminate the information contained in the AML/CFT central database. Moreover, the draft RTS set out the rules to ensure the effectiveness of the database, the confidentiality of the data contained in the database, as well as how the database will interact with other notifications that competent authorities are required to provide to the EBA and the provisions to ensure the protection of personal data. The AML/CFT central database will be a key tool in coordinating efforts to prevent and counter ML/TF in the Union. It will serve as an early warning tool to enable the competent authorities to act before the ML/TF risks crystalise and help them plan their on-site inspections and perform off-site monitoring. Consultation process\u00a0 The Consultation Paper is composed of the draft RTS as well as an Annex that sets out, firstly, the technical specifications with the data points that will be contained in the database and, secondly, the list of authorities that will be indirectly submitting to the AML/CFT database in accordance with article 13(7) of the draft RTS. As those technical specifications are not part of the draft RTS, the EBA is not required to consult on them but has decided to offer the respondents the possibility to provide comments also on those.

The response of the EDPS will be taken into consideration when the final report on this draft RTS will be developed. Legal basis\u00a0and background\u00a0 The proposed RTSs have been developed in fulfillment of the mandates conferred on the EBA in Articles 9a(1) and (3) of the EBA Regulation. As part of the mandate to lead, coordinate and monitor AML/CFT in Europe, said Articles require the EBA to develop two RTSs to establish and keep up to date an AML/CFT central database. The mandate foresees for the AML/CFT central database to contain information on AML/CFT weaknesses that have been identified by competent authorities and on the measures taken by them in response to those material weaknesses. Given the complementary character of those RTS, the EBA has drafted them as a single instrument. The EBA has performed a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) in accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 (EUDPR). The DPIA analyses the risks arising from the processing of personal data and establishes the controls that will be put in place by the EBA to mitigate the risks identified. A summary of this draft DPIA is published on the EBA\u2019s website for full transparency alongside the Consultation Paper.

The NPL templates are being streamlined to help banks better prepare as part of their NPL management strategies in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, whilst addressing information asymmetries to promote price discovery between buyers and sellers. The revised templates take into account the experience of market participants on the buyer and seller side and this consultation is a critical opportunity to hear from all relevant stakeholders to facilitate the future widespread use of the templates across the single market The European Banking Authority (EBA) publishes today a discussion paper to facilitate the review of the standardised NPL data templates. The discussion paper invites all stakeholders and NPL market participants on the buyer and seller side to provide their input. The consultation runs until 31 August 2021. The NPL data templates play an important role in providing a common basis for data exchange in secondary markets, which is part of the overall strategy to tackle NPLs in the EU since 2017. The current revision of the template is based on the user experience and feedback from various market participants and responds to the European Commission\u2019s Communication on tackling NPLs in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2020) that, amongst others, requests the EBA to review the templates based on a consultation with market participants in the course of 2021. With this consultation, the EBA opens a discussion with market participants a number of aspects of the templates such as the design, data fields to be included, as well as their criticality and availability. The objective of this revision is to make these voluntary data templates simpler, more proportionate and more effective and make them available to all market participants by the end of 2021. \u00a0This will enable price discovery in a consistent way across the single market. However, the EBA notes that the adoption of the proposed Directive on credit servicers, purchasers and recovery of collateral may mandate the EBA to turn these data templates into implementing technical standards (ITS), for which the EBA would have to publish a consultation paper. Background The EBA developed standardised NPL data templates in 2017 to help facilitating financial due diligence and the valuation of NPL transactions. These templates aimed to reduce information asymmetries and barriers to entry in EU NPL markets, and provide a benchmark for a common data standard for transactions, enabling NPLs to be compared, also across jurisdictions. \u00a0This will address inefficiencies associated with information asymmetries and fragmented approaches across the single market. The EBA\u2019s initiative on the NPL data templates is part of the wider action plan to tackle NPLs in Europe and to provide additional tools for banks in the management and reduction of NPLs on their balance sheets. In its Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures, the EBA requires banks to introduce and operationalise NPL reduction strategies. While there are several tools available to banks to manage and reduce NPLs, secondary market transactions is one of these tools. To this end, the data templates aim to support banks\u2019 strategies to manage and reduce their NPLs, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The latter are then encouraged to take corrective actions and to better comply with applicable requirements, thus eventually enhancing the protection of consumers. The European Banking Authority (EBA)\u00a0published today a Report on the mystery shopping activities of NCAs. The EBA collated mystery shopping activities by NCAs with a view to share experiences, learn valuable lessons, and identify good practices for the benefit of the EBA and NCAs that use or intend to use mystery shopping in the future. The Report covers mystery shopping initiatives of NCAs in respect of products that fall within the scope of action of the EBA\u2019s consumer protection mandate, which are consumer credit, mortgage credit, deposits, payment services, electronic money, and payment accounts. It summarises the most common approaches used by the NCAs, based on the information collated primarily covering the period from 2015 to 2020. It does so by reviewing three key characteristics of mystery shopping activities: their objective, subject matter and product scope, the methodologies used by NCAs, and the follow-up actions after the mystery shopping was concluded. The Report also identify some lessons learned and sets out good practices. At this stage, only a limited number of NCAs carried out such mystery shopping activities in their jurisdiction. Moreover, some NCAs reported that discussions are currently taking place at national level on the possibility of adding such powers to relevant competent authorities\u2019 mandate, for some of them as part of the implementation of the EU Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation. Regarding the lessons learned, the Report explains that mystery shopping allows NCAs to obtain greater insight into the conduct of financial institutions. This, in turn, encourages them to take corrective actions better to comply with applicable requirements, and eventually enhances the protection of consumers. Among the good practices identified by the NCAs, most of them concern common procedural aspects such as organising training for NCAs\u2019 inspection and supervisory staff,\u00a0 identifying target customer profiles, and defining agreed \u2018rules\u2019 of customer\u2019s behaviour.

Additional amendments to the templates are introduced with the aim of streamlining reporting requirements, filling in data gaps and further clarifying the reporting instructions. \u00a0In particular, small and non-complex institutions could be exempted from reporting metrics regarding concentration of funding by product type (C 68.00), the funding price for various lengths of funding (C 69.00) and information on roll-over of funding (C 70.00). The liquidity metrics and related reporting are thus reduced to the maturity ladder-monitoring tool, concentration of funding by counterparty and by counterbalancing capacity.

The EBA proposes to delineate clearly that only funds contributed by credit institution to the ex-ante funds of DGSs will count towards reaching the target level of said funds. The EBA proposes to expand the current reporting requirements from DGSs to the EBA and to publish more information about DGS funding on the EBA website. The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on its draft Guidelines on the delineation and reporting of available financial means (AFM) of Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGSs). The purpose of the Guidelines is to ensure that only funds that credit institutions contributed, or that stem indirectly from such contributions such as recoveries or investment income, will count towards reaching the target level of the DGS fund. Conversely, funds that stem directly or indirectly from borrowed resources should not count towards the target level. This clarification aims at preventing the situation where a DGS could meet the target level by taking out a loan. By developing these Guidelines, the EBA follows up on its recommendations made in the EBA Opinion on deposit guarantee scheme funding and uses of deposit guarantee scheme funds (\u201cthe Opinion\u201d) published on 23 January 2020. In the Opinion, the EBA identified differences across Member States in relation to the interpretation of the concept of AFM. The Opinion recommended clarifying Directive 2014/49/EU (DGSD) that borrowed funds or funds stemming from borrowed funds should not count towards reaching the minimum target level for DGS funds. Given that a review of the DGSD is still several years away from being proposed, negotiated and finalised, the proposed Guidelines provide such a clarification ahead of any such changes, using the existing DGSD as a legal basis. More precisely, the draft Guidelines clarify that AFM are comprised of two subsets: Qualified AFM (QAFM) \u2013 funds stemming directly or indirectly from contributions of DGS member institutions, which qualify towards reaching the target level of the DGS fund; Other AFM \u2013 funds, which are not QAFM, including borrowed funds that stem from liabilities such as loans, and hence do not count towards reaching the target level of the DGS fund. In terms of reporting, the proposed Guidelines will extend the reporting requirements from DGSs to the EBA in order to reflect the clarified concept of AFM, QAFM and other AFM proposed earlier in the Guidelines. They also require the reporting on outstanding liabilities of DGSs, unclaimed repayments, and high-level information on alternative funding arrangements that are in place. That information would be published on the EBA website annually and should provide more transparency and comparability of the financial position of DGSs across the EU.

These RTS are part of the phase 3 deliverables of the\u00a0EBA roadmap for the new market and counterparty credit risk approaches. The consultation runs until 2 July 2021. Institutions using the alternative standardised approach to determine own funds requirements for market risk are required to compute the equity risk stemming from their trading book positions in accordance with a prescribed set of risk factors and corresponding risk weights. To determine the appropriate risk-weight, institutions are to identify whether a risk factor refers to an advanced economy or an emerging market. Risk factors mapped to the advanced economy bucket benefit from a lower risk weight compared to those mapped to the emerging market bucket. To ensure compliance with the international standards, the consultation paper proposes a list of advanced economies corresponding to the list provided in the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB). In this context, the EBA seeks feedback on whether the list is comprehensive, in particular, whether there are additional EU countries where the equity risk can be considered similar to the countries\u2019 already included in the FRTB list of advanced economies. Furthermore, the EBA seeks stakeholders\u2019 views on sources of data and criteria that could be designed to identify advanced economies and emerging markets for the purpose of FRTB-SA equity risk own funds requirements.

The report highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic continues to weigh heavily on short-term recovery prospects. It also highlights a number of vulnerabilities in the financial markets and warns of possible further market corrections. Macroeconomic conditions improved in the second half of 2020, supported by ongoing fiscal and monetary policy efforts, but the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic since the last quarter of 2020 has led to increasing economic uncertainty. The start of the rollout of vaccinations provides a crucial anchor for medium-term expectations, but insufficient production capacities, delays in deliveries as well as risks related to mutations of the virus are weighing heavily on short-term recovery prospects. Macroeconomic uncertainty was generally not reflected in asset valuations and market volatility which have recovered to pre-crisis levels, highlighting a continued risk of decoupling of valuations from economic fundamentals. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the ESAs advise\u00a0national competent authorities, financial institutions and market participants to take the following policy actions: Prepare for an expected deterioration of asset quality: banks should adjust provisioning models to adequately address the impact of the economic shock of the pandemic and to ensure a timely recognition of adequate levels of provisions. They should engage to restructure over indebted but viable exposure efficiently. To supervisors, banks\u2019 provisioning policies should continue to be a point of particular attention; Continue to develop further actions to accommodate a \u201clow-for-long\u201d interest rate environment and its risks: while low interest rates are important to support economic activity, they negatively impact banks\u2019 interest income and remain the main risk for the life insurance and pension fund sector. For insurers, it is important that the regulatory framework also reflects the steep fall in interest rates experienced in recent years and the existence of negative interest rates. Financial institutions should also continue to monitor, and be prepared for, changes in interest rates, especially in light of the recent upward shifts of long-term interest rates and the consequent concerns about re-emerging inflationary pressures; Ensure sound lending practices and adequate pricing of risks: banks should continue to make thorough risk assessments to ensure that lending remains viable in the future, and this should be closely monitored by supervisors. Banks should continue to make thorough risk assessments to ensure that lending remains viable, including after public support measures such as loan moratoria and public guarantee schemes will expire; Follow conservative policies on dividends and share buy-backs: any distributions should not exceed thresholds of prudency; and Investment funds should further enhance their preparedness in the face of potential increases in redemptions and valuation shocks: to this end the alignment of fund investment strategy, liquidity profile and redemption policy should be supervised, as well as funds\u2019 liquidity risk assessment and valuation processes in a context of valuation uncertainty. Background The three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board. The Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the ESAs.

While non-performing loans (NPLs) declined on average, the NPL ratio shows first signs of deterioration in exposures to sectors that are most affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The share of stage 2 loans rose across the board. The rise was particularly pronounced for loans still under moratoria. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its Risk Dashboard for the last quarter of 2020. The data show a rise in capital ratios, a contraction of the NPL ratio and a return on equity (RoE) significantly below banks\u2019 cost of equity. Besides asset quality and profitability, operational risks remain a key concern going forward. Capital ratios continued to improve in Q4, driven by an increase in capital, which more than offset a slight rise in risk weighted assets. The CET1 ratio reached a new all-time high of 15.5% on a fully loaded basis, up by 40bps QoQ. The leverage ratio (on a fully loaded basis) increased to 5.8% from 5.5% in the previous quarter. This was supported by growing capital, but also a decline in total assets. The NPL ratio decreased by 20bps to 2.6%. The decline was due to a contraction in NPLs, which exceeded the decrease in loans and advances. NPL ratios declined for both households and non-financial corporates (NFCs). While the NPL ratio improved for most economic sectors it increased for accommodation and food services (up from 7.8% to 8.5% QoQ) and arts, entertainment and recreation (up from 6.7% to 7.3%). The share of stage 2 loans reached 9.1% in Q4, showing a 110bps increase QoQ. Loans under EBA eligible moratoria nearly halved in Q4. They declined from around EUR 590bn in Q3 to around EUR 320bn in Q4. The decline was more pronounced for NFC exposures than for loans to households. The share of stage 2 loans under moratoria (26.4%) is above that for loans under expired moratoria (20.1%) and nearly three times the ratio for total loans (9.1%). This might indicate that loans, which are still under moratoria, might be those with higher risks looking forward. Loans under public guarantee schemes (PGS) reached about EUR 340bn, up from around EUR 290bn in Q3. Whereas for PGS loans the share of stage 2 loans (11.7%) was above the overall average of 9.1%, the NPL ratio (1.1%) was less than half of the overall average (2.6%). Profitability remained strongly subdued. RoE declined from 2.5% in Q3 to 2% in Q4. The rise in net fee and commission income could not compensate for the decline in net interest income. The latter was due to the contraction in interest bearing assets, amid a flat net interest margin. Cost of risk remained high and nearly unchanged at 75bps, but with high dispersion, indicating different situations among individual banks. The cost to income ratio rose by 40bps to 65.1% in Q4. Pressure on profitability is expected to remain persistently high. The deterioration of asset quality and uncertainty on the recovery might keep the cost of risk elevated, while strong competition continues to add pressure on net interest margins and fee income. In the short-term, the repricing of wholesale funding might be faster than that of the asset side, hence, adding pressure on margins. Banks will need to streamline their operational structure not least because their clients are increasingly using digital channels. Banks\u2019 liquidity position further improved. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) reached 173.1% in Q4 (171.2% in Q3). The loan to deposit ratio declined from 113.6% in Q3 2020 to 112.2% in Q4, supported by a rise in client deposits from households and NFCs. The asset encumbrance ratio remained unchanged at 27.9%. Phishing attempts and other types of cyber-attacks are becoming more common. The increase in remote customer on boarding and a rising participation in virtual currency transactions may expose banks to additional money laundering (ML) / terrorist financing (TF) risks. Risks of new types of misconduct and of potentially fraudulent activities related to COVID-19 support measures have not abated. Notes to editors The figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 130 banks, covering more than 80% of the EU/EEA banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates also include large subsidiaries (the list of banks can be found here).

The Joint Opinion aims to clarify the potential obligations of those third-country parties, as well as related compliance aspects of a transaction under SECR, and is intended to help improve the functioning of EU securitisation markets. The ESAs, in their Joint Opinion, set out their common view on the practical difficulties faced by market participants in connection with the jurisdictional scope of application of various provisions in the SECR in the following four scenarios: securitisations where some, but not all, of their sell-side parties i.e. originator, original lender, sponsor and special purpose entity issuer etc., are located in a third country; securitisations where all sell-side parties are located in a third country and EU investors invest in them; investments in securitisations by subsidiaries of EU regulated groups, where those subsidiaries are located in a third country; and securitisations where one of the parties is a third country investment fund manager The Joint Opinion recommends that these difficulties should be addressed, where possible, through interpretative guidance from the European Commission.

The instruments clarify that compliance with anti-money and countering terrorist financing (AML/CTF) obligations in EU law does not require financial institutions to refuse, or terminate, business relationships with entire categories of customers that they consider to present a higher ML/TF risk. In these documents the EBA also set out steps that financial institutions and competent authorities should take to manage risks associated with individual business relationships in an effective manner. De-risking refers to decisions taken by financial institutions not to provide services to customers in certain risk categories. This can leave customers without access to the financial system. De-risking can be a legitimate risk management tool in some cases but it can also be a sign of ineffective ML/TF risk management, with severe consequences. The EBA referred to particular aspects of de-risking in its previous work, such as in the Opinion in 2016 to mitigate risks of financial exclusion of asylum seekers in situations where they were unable to provide the standard Customer Due Diligence documentation. However, it has become apparent that more comprehensive action is needed to address unwarranted de-risking, given its impact on consumers and competition in the single market. In May 2020, the EBA therefore launched a Call for Input to the wider public so as to better understand the drivers, scale and the impact of de-risking across the EU. The EBA subsequently assessed the extensive feedback received and, issued three legal instruments this month to address this issue. First, the EBA published its 2021 Opinion on ML/TF risks in the EU financial sector, in which it observes that de-risking is a continuing trend that has implications from an ML/TF risk, consumer protection and financial stability point of view and sets out a number of actions the competent authorities should take to understand the drivers, scale and impact of de-risking in their sectors. Secondly, the EBA issued its revised ML/TF Risk Factors Guidelines, which clarify that the application of a risk-based approach to AML/CFT does not require financial institutions to refuse, or terminate, business relationships with entire categories of customers that are considered to present higher ML/TF risk. Instead, the Guidelines provide guidance on the steps financial institutions should take effectively to manage ML/TF risks associated with individual business relationships. Finally, the EBA launched a public consultation on changes to its existing Guidelines on risk-based AML/CFT supervision. The proposed Guidelines require competent authorities to take stock of the extent of de-risking in their jurisdiction and address de-risking in their ML/TF risk assessments. The proposed Guidelines also require competent authorities to pay particular attention to the way financial institutions manage ML/TF risks and encourage them to engage with their sectors to ensure that financial institutions have a good understanding of the regulatory expectations of how ML/TF risks should be managed. Throughout the remainder of this year, the EBA will continue to monitor and assess the scale and impact of, as well as the reasons for, de-risking, and consider the extent to which the current legal and regulatory framework is sufficient to address the issues associated with de-risking. Legal basis The EBA is carrying out its work on de-risking to fulfil its mandates to lead, coordinate and monitor the EU financial sector\u2019s fight against ML/TF, to contribute to the protection of consumers across the EU, and to bring about supervisory convergence in the implementation of the competition enhancing objective of PSD2.

The EBA issued the existing\u00a0Guidelines on recovery plan indicators\u00a0in 2015 but decided to amend them based on practical experience acquired in recovery planning.\u00a0 The revised Guidelines provide additional guidance on the calibration of thresholds of recovery indicators to ensure that recovery options are implemented early enough to be effective. The amendments also emphasise the importance of constant monitoring of recovery indicators and timely notification of their breaches to supervisors. Lastly, three new recovery indicators (MREL/TLAC, asset encumbrance and liquidity position) have been added to the minimum list of recovery indicators and one (cost of wholesale funding) has been removed.

The dial-in details will be communicated in due course. Legal basis, background and next steps In accordance with Article 9(1) of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), a recovery plan should include a framework of indicators established by each institution with the aim of identifying the points at which the escalation process should be activated and to assess what appropriate actions referred to in the recovery plan may be taken. Under the mandate of Article 9(2) of BRRD, in 2015 the EBA issued Guidelines to specify the minimum list of quantitative and qualitative indicators for the purposes of recovery planning (EBA-GL-2015-02). Since the development of the Guidelines in 2015, significant practical experience in developing and assessing recovery plans has been acquired. Against this background, the EBA has concluded that, while limited amendments to its existing Guidelines are needed, it is necessary to introduce additional guidance on certain parts of the indicator framework. The revised Guidelines are published for a three-month public consultation where the EBA is consulting only on changes to the existing Guidelines on the minimum list of qualitative and quantitative recovery plan indicators. There is no consultation on the text of the original Guidelines, which remains unchanged. The EBA will finalise these Guidelines once the consultation responses have been assessed. Upon publication of the final Guidelines, the original ones on the minimum list of qualitative and quantitative recovery plan indicators will be repealed.

They aggregate existing international standards, leverage on existing EU best practices and implement them into an EU-wide legal document. The consultation runs until 17 June 2021. These Guidelines take stock of the best practices developed so far by EU resolution authorities on resolvability topics. In particular, these Guidelines set-out requirements to improve resolvability in the areas of operational continuity in resolution, access to Financial Market Infrastructure, funding and liquidity in resolution, bail-in execution, business reorganisation and communication. While not covering all topics relevant to resolvability either because (i) those are covered elsewhere (e.g. the calibration and eligibility of loss absorbing capacity is extensively covered in BRRD) or (ii) because those topics will be further specified in future EBA regulatory products (e.g. transferability), these Guidelines aim to be the policy point of reference for both authorities and institutions on resolvability related topics in the EU. The aim is to ensure consistent progress on resolvability for all institutions and facilitate resolvability work for cross-border groups and its monitoring in resolution colleges.

These economic activities are defined by the EU Regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (Taxonomy Regulation). The proposed draft RTS aim to: facilitate disclosures to end investors regarding the investments of financial products in environmentally sustainable activities.; and create a single rulebook for sustainability disclosures under the Regulation on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (SFDR) and the Taxonomy Regulation. This will be done by amending the draft RTS under the SFDR, \u00a0to minimise overlapping or duplicative requirements between the two regulations. The consultation paper includes additional taxonomy-related disclosures concern information about which environmental objectives the investments of the product contribute to, and information about how, and to what extent, the activities funded by the product are Taxonomy-aligned. The ESAs\u2019 proposal on how and to what extent activities funded by the product are taxonomy- aligned, consist of two elements: a graphical representation of the taxonomy-alignment of investments of the financial product and a key performance indicator calculation for that alignment; and a statement that the activities funded by the product that qualify as environmentally sustainable, are compliant with the detailed criteria of the Taxonomy Regulation. The ESAs also propose to standardise the presentation of the disclosures by amending the templates for the pre-contractual and periodic disclosures proposed in the draft RTS under the SFDR, by adding a new section that includes the disclosures required under the Taxonomy Regulation. By amending the SFDR, the Taxonomy Regulation empowered the ESAs to develop draft RTS on additional pre-contractual, and periodic disclosure, obligations for financial products making sustainable investments with environmental objectives. Next steps The closing date for responses to the consultation is 12 May 2021. Following the consultation period, the draft RTS will be finalised and submitted to the European Commission.

The proposed changes\u00a0address the key obstacles to effective AML/CFT\u00a0supervision that the EBA has identified during its review of the existing Guidelines, including the effective use of different supervisory tools to meet the supervisory objectives.\u00a0The Guidelines are central to the EBA\u2019s mandate to lead, coordinate and monitor the EU financial sector\u2019s fight against money laundering and\u00a0terrorist financing.\u00a0The consultation runs until\u00a017 June 2021.\u00a0 The Guidelines on risk-based AML/CFT supervision\u00a0were originally published\u00a0by the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) in 2016 and set out\u00a0steps that competent authorities should take to ensure compliance by credit and financial institutions with their AML/CFT obligations. Since their publication, the EBA has observed that supervisors across the EU were finding the\u00a0implementation\u00a0of the risk-based approach to AML/CFT supervision difficult, which meant that AML/CFT supervision was not always as effective as the legal framework set out in Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AMLD) and the ESAs\u2019 Guidelines had envisaged. The changes the EBA is proposing include practical step-by-step approaches to addressing those aspects of AML/CFT supervision that competent authorities have found particularly challenging. The revised Guidelines focus on helping the supervisors identify and manage ML/TF risks more effectively, including the risks that may arise from de-risking practices in some sectors or Member States by providing greater detail on ML/TF risk assessments and by requiring to develop a robust\u00a0supervisory strategy and plan\u00a0that are based on those risk assessments. The Guidelines also set out how supervisors can choose the most effective supervisory tools to support different supervisory needs and objectives, and stress the importance of cooperation between different supervisory authorities, and between supervisors and other stakeholders, such as Financial Intelligence Units and financial institutions. In addition, the Guidelines emphasise the importance for supervisors to develop a good understanding of ML/TF risks associated with tax crimes, which may involve a cooperation with tax authorities in their Member State.\u00a0 Once implemented, the proposed changes will foster greater convergence of supervisory practices in areas where supervisory effectiveness\u00a0has been hampered, so far, by divergent approaches in the implementation of the same European legal requirements.\u00a0This means that they will significantly strengthen Europe\u2019s AML/CFT defences.

Legal basis\u00a0and background\u00a0 Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AMLD) puts the risk-based approach at the centre of the EU\u2019s AML/CFT regime. It recognises that the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing may vary between countries, sectors and financial institutions and that Member States, competent authorities and credit and financial institutions should identify and assess these risks in order to decide how\u00a0to best manage\u00a0them.\u00a0 Article 48(10) of AMLD mandates the EBA\u00a0to issue Guidelines addressed\u00a0to competent authorities on\u00a0the characteristics of a risk-based approach to supervision and the steps to be taken when conducting supervision on a risk-based basis. The mandate requires the EBA to take specific account\u00a0of the nature and size of the business, and, where appropriate and proportionate, specific measures shall be laid down.\u00a0The revised Guidelines\u00a0also propose to take into consideration changes in the EU legal framework that came into force since the original guidelines\u00a0were first issued,\u00a0as well as new international guidance by the Financial Action Taskforce (FATF) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on this topic.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-consults-changes-its-guidelines-risk-based-amlcft-supervision"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0106", "date": "2021-03-16", "text_type": "PR", "title": "The EBA will make its Basel III monitoring exercise mandatory", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a decision, which will change the Basel III monitoring exercise from its current voluntary nature to a mandatory exercise from December 2021. This change stems from the need to expand the sample to more jurisdictions and credit institutions, making it more representative, as well as to reach a stable sample over time by providing authorities with a sound legal basis that frames institutions\u2019 participation. This decision will assist the EBA to represent, effectively, the interests of EU institutions in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and to provide informed opinions and technical advice to the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council regarding the implementation of the BCBS standards into the Union law. The initiative introduces a clear, transparent and fair methodology on how institutions should be included in the sample, and guarantees enhanced stability of the sample over time by taking into account the proportionality principle. In addition, this decision provides competent authorities and institutions of the Member States with provisions for a reduced frequency of reporting Basel III data, i.e. annually, and for mandatory submission of only a part of the Basel templates. These provisions intend to offload some of the reporting burden that participating credit institutions might bear otherwise. The decision applies clear selection criteria for defining the country samples. Specifically, each member state should apply, sequentially, the following criteria: all Global and Other Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs and O-SIIs) are included in the country sample at the highest level of EU consolidation, irrespective of their size; If 80% RWA coverage is not exceeded, and the sample is smaller than 30 banks, additional large banks (Tier 1 capital > EUR 3 billion or Total Assets > EUR 30 million), that are not O-SIIs, are included until 80% RWA coverage is exceeded; If 80% RWA coverage is not exceeded, additional medium-sized and small banks, that are not O-SIIs, are selected from the eligible population of three different broad business models according to predefined percentages per business model. \u00a0Additionally, the decision intends to limit the burden on small jurisdictions, as a whole (member state\u2019s RWA < 0.5% of the total EU RWA), by limiting the participation to O-SIIs only, irrespective of whether the 80% RWA coverage is exceeded or not. \u00a0Note to the editors The eligible population is the population of credit institutions per business model after excluding those whose individual RWA is below 0.1% of the member state\u2019s total RWA; Broad business models are those of credit institutions that provide (a) universal services, (b) retail-oriented services, and (c) corporate-oriented and other services; The predefined percentages per business model are: 20% of the number of institutions that provide universal services, 2% of those providing retail-oriented services, and 20% of those providing corporate-oriented and other services. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-will-make-its-basel-iii-monitoring-exercise-mandatory"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0107", "date": "2021-03-15", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA releases its annual assessment of the consistency of internal model outcomes for 2020", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today two Reports on the consistency of risk weighted assets (RWAs) across all EU institutions authorised to use internal approaches for the calculation of capital requirements for 2020. The Reports cover credit risk for high and low default portfolios (LDPs and HDPs), as well as market risk. The results confirm that the majority of risk-weights (RWs) variability can be explained by fundamentals. These benchmarking exercises are a fundamental supervisory and convergence tool to address unwarranted inconsistencies and restoring trust in internal models. Credit Risk exercise The horizontal analysis of the data collected in the course of the 2020 Benchmarking (BM) exercise is summarised as usual in the credit risk Report. The results of the 2020 regular benchmarking analyses for credit risk are largely comparable to those of the last exercises. This can be seen as an indication of the general stability of bank portfolios and internal model outcomes. As in the past years, the observed variability (in terms of Global Charge ) of institutions\u2019 overall IRBA exposure can mostly be explained by the different share of defaulted and non-defaulted exposures and by the portfolio mix of the individual institutions (i.e. the different distribution of IRB-exposures over exposure classes). For HDP as well as for LDP, around 60% of the total variability is explained via these two drivers. Furthermore, the Report includes an analysis on the newly introduced portfolios on specialised lending exposures (SLE). This analysis reveals that variability of RWAs calculated under the IRB approach for SLE stems primarily from an unequal distribution across banks in terms of type and volume of investment into SLE. Of particular interest may be the variability stemming from the use of the four different regulatory approaches available for SLE (SA, FIRB, AIRB and the supervisory slotting approach). In line with the expectation, the analysis shows that the average RW consumption of SLE exposures is lower for exposures under AIRB than for FIRB exposures or those under the supervisory slotting approach. Equally, analysis is provided on the newly introduced split for the large corporates (LCOR) portfolios, which confirms that about three quarters of the exposure at default (EAD) of this benchmarking exposure class is expected to be under the FIRB approach under the revised Basel reform. Market Risk exercise\u00a0 The 2020 exercise considered the same instruments applied in 2019, which are mostly plain vanilla financial instruments. This stability facilitated the understanding of the benchmarking portfolio and contributed to an observed reduction in overall dispersion.\u00a0 However, at portfolio level, the variability increases with the risk metric\u2019s complexity, and stressed value at risk, incremental risk charge and all price risk show higher levels of dispersion. Across asset classes, except for commodity exposures, the overall variability for value at risk (18%, it was 21% in 2019 exercise) is lower than the observed variability for stressed VaR (29% it was 30% in 2019 exercise). More complex measures such as incremental risk charge (IRC) and all price risk (APR) show a higher level of dispersion (49% and 45% respectively, compared with 54% and 37% in 2019). The quantitative analysis, was complemented by a questionnaire to competent authorities on banks participating in the exercise. Although the majority of the causes were identified, and actions put in place to reduce the unwanted variability of the hypothetical RWAs, the effectiveness of these actions can be evaluated only with on-going analysis. Note to the editors These annual benchmarking exercises contribute to the work the EBA is conducting for improving the regulatory framework, increase convergence of supervisory practices and, thus, restoring confidence in internal models. For credit risk internal models, the EBA has followed its\u00a0roadmap for the implementation of the regulatory review of internal models. This exercise should be read in parallel with other efforts to reduce undue levels of variability. In particular, the \u00a0EBA roadmap to repair IRB models\u00a0is a key component of the review of the IRB framework, along with the enhancements brought by the\u00a0final Basel\u00a0III framework\u00a0assessed by the EBA in a set of recommendations as an\u00a0answer to the call for advice of the European Commission. The exercises provide a regular supervisory tool based on benchmarks to support competent authorities' assessments of internal models and produce comparisons with EU peers.

This Report, which complements the one published on 12 July 2019, highlights areas in which further guidance is deemed useful for banks and supervisors in order to foster a common understanding and harmonisation of the application of the liquidity standard across the EU, as well as to reduce some level playing field issues. The EBA will continue regularly monitoring the implementation of the LCR for EU banks and will update these reports on an ongoing basis to set out its observations and provide further guidance, where necessary. The general objective of the EBA monitoring work in the area of liquidity is to foster a higher degree of harmonisation in the implementation of the LCR in the areas where divergent practices have been observed, partly due to insufficient clarity of the regulatory provisions. In particular, this second Report provides guidance on the treatment of fiduciary deposits, LCR optimisation risk, interdependent inflows and outflows and assessment of deposit guarantee schemes (DGS) conditions for a 3% outflow rates in stable retail deposits. In addition, the Report discusses a number of items in the context of a crisis, in particular in view of the COVID 19 pandemic: the usage of liquidity buffers, guidance on unwinding mechanism waivers, recourse to central bank support and additional outflows from derivatives. Finally, the Report assesses the effects of the guidance issued in the first Report. The EBA will further assess how the guidance provided in the Report will be used by banks and supervisors and consider taking further steps, if needed (including some fully fledged products such as guidelines, recommendations, etc.), while continuing its monitoring of the aspects mentioned in the Report.

These draft RTS are part of the phase 3 deliverables of the EBA roadmap for the new market and counterparty credit risk approaches. Both consultations run until 12 June 2021. Institutions using the alternative standardised approach (FRTB-SA) to determine own funds requirements for market risk are required to compute, on top of the own funds requirement under the sensitivities-based method, additional own funds requirements for default risk and for residual risks. The consultation papers published today provide technical specifications for the implementation of these two elements. In particular, the draft RTS on gross JTD amounts specify the key inputs needed for computing own funds requirements for default risk under the FRTB-SA. Gross JTD amounts determined in accordance with the draft RTS are intended to be consistent with those determined in accordance with international standards, while employing the formulae and requirements set out in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). The draft RTS on RRAO clarify the scope of the RRAO, i.e. for which instruments the own funds capital requirements for residual risks should be determined. In particular, these RTS specify a non-exhaustive list of instruments bearing residual risks, and a list of risks that, in themselves, do not constitute residual risks. These RTS also clarify that longevity risk, weather, natural disasters and future realised volatility should all be considered as exotic underlyings.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on\u00a0its revised Guidelines on the stress tests conducted by national DGSs under the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD). The proposed revision will extend the scope of the DGS stress testing, by requiring more tests that will cover additional aspects of DGS interventions. The proposed framework will also achieve greater harmonisation and comparability, to enable the EBA to carry out a robust peer review of national DGS stress tests in 2024/25. The EBA proposes to require DGSs to stress test their ability to perform all of the interventions allowed under their legal mandates, and to access all of their funding sources. The draft revised Guidelines strengthen the cooperation between DGSs and other authorities by testing scenarios where such cooperation is necessary. In addition, the proposed new provisions require DGSs to consider testing scenarios with additional business continuity challenges, such as the pandemic, ICT failures or other similar events. The proposed revisions are based on the findings of the first EBA peer review of the DGS stress tests and resilience of national DGSs, which the EBA published in a\u00a0report\u00a0in June 2020.

The discussion paper presents a range of options around the main areas needed for the development of an integrated and consistent reporting system: a data dictionary and a central data collection point, together with the related governance aspects. Each of the areas are essential components of a reporting process and their design, as part of an integrated system, would influence the way the current reporting process is conducted. The study builds on a fact-finding and research phase as well as on the experience of all relevant authorities in integrating reporting and private sector stakeholders\u2019 views on current challenges and potential solutions.

The Report identifies topical issues including irresponsible lending, creditworthiness assessments, and digitalisation, which the EBA has very recently addressed, as well as others, such as selling practices and access to bank account, which it has recently started to work on. The Report also explains the measures the EBA has taken to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumers. In this Report, the EBA observed that mortgages continue to have a big impact on consumers' personal finances, representing 79% of loans to households. During the same period, the volume of consumer credit has increased by 14%, and that of deposits by 14.6%. In both mortgages and consumer credit, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a heightened engagement between lenders and borrowers with a focus on the use of moratoria and government guarantees. The EBA has supported such initiatives, with the aim of supporting the short-term operational and liquidity challenges faced by borrowers. The Report also observes that the number of people holding a payment account within the EU has further increased and now covers a significant percentage of the EU population. However, issues have emerged regarding the impact of \u201cde-risking\u201d on customers who are denied access to such accounts. Regarding payment services, payment cards continue to be the most widely used payment instrument in the EU. The Report observes an increase in the use of contactless payments during the COVID-19 pandemic, which the EBA facilitated by calling on payment services providers to facilitate contactless payments, including by increasing the limit closer to the EUR50 threshold allowed under EU law. This Report is based on information provided by the national authorities of the 27 EU Member States, national and EU consumer associations, the members of the \u2018Financial Dispute Resolution Network' and EU industry associations. The Report also assesses quantitative data from the European Central Bank and the World Bank. Legal basis The Consumer Trends Report for 2020/21 has been developed in fulfilment of the EBA\u2019s mandate set out in Article 9 of the EBA founding Regulation, which requires the Authority to take a leading role in promoting transparency, simplicity and fairness in the market for consumer financial products or services across the internal market, including by collecting, analysing and reporting on consumer trends.

The final draft ITS take into account the different classes of investments firms to ensure requirements are proportionate to the nature, size and complexity of investment firms. Consistency and integration between both reporting and disclosures will facilitate the implementation of these new requirements. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on the supervisory reporting and disclosures of investment firms. These final draft ITS, which are part of the phase 1 mandates of the\u00a0EBA roadmap on investment firms, will ensure a proportionate implementation of the new prudential framework for investment firms taking into account the different activities, sizes and complexity of investments firms. The implementing technical standards included in this package set out the main aspects of the new reporting framework in relation to the calculation of own funds, levels of minimum capital, concentration risk, liquidity requirements and the level of activity in respect of small and non-interconnected investment firms. The ITS propose a different set of templates to cover small and non-interconnected investment firms, and to include information that is proportionate to their size and complexity. In addition, the ITS includes a standardised set of templates for the disclosures of own funds.

The ML/TF risks identified by the EBA include those that are applicable to the entire financial system, for instance the use of innovative financial services, while others affect specific sectors, such as de-risking. The list also includes ML/TF risks that emerge from wider developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic that has an impact on both firms\u2019 AML/CFT compliance and competent authorities\u2019 supervision. The Opinion, therefore, sets out recommendations to competent authorities aimed at closing these gaps. Some of the risks identified in this Opinion, such as those associated with virtual currencies and innovative financial services, had already been identified in the previous two Opinions on ML/TF risks and continue to be very relevant today. Others are included in the Opinion for the first time, such as differences in the treatment by competent authorities of financial institutions\u2019 involvement in facilitating or handling tax-related crimes (\u2018cum-ex/cum-cum\u2019). The EBA also observes a continuing trend of de-risking, which has implications from a ML/TF, consumer protection and financial stability point of view. The COVID19 pandemic illustrates how new ML/TF risks can emerge unexpectedly and that can impact firms\u2019 ability to ensure adequate AML/CFT compliance, and competent authorities\u2019 ability to ensure the ongoing supervision of firms in the current context of restrictions on movement. Risks associated with COVID19, thus, require immediate attention and monitoring by competent authorities. As a complement to this Opinion, the EBA has developed an interactive tool, which gives European citizens, competent authorities and credit and financial institutions access in a user friendly manner to all ML/TF risks covered in the Opinion. The interactive tool is available here.\u00a0 Legal basis The Opinion has been issued in accordance with Article 6(5) of (EU) 2015/849 (The Fourth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive), which requires the EBA to issue an Opinion on the risks of ML and TF affecting the EU's financial sector every two years.

Proportionality measures and policy recommendations to the Commission are advised in order to facilitate institutions\u2019 disclosures and eventually extend the scope of the KPIs. The EBA has developed this Advice in parallel and consistently with its Consultation Paper on Pillar 3 disclosures on ESG risks, including a common proposal for a Green Asset Ratio (GAR). The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today an Opinion in response to the Commission\u2019s call for advice on KPIs and related methodology for the disclosure by credit institutions and by investment firms of information on how and to what extent their activities qualify as environmentally sustainable in accordance with the EU Taxonomy. In the advice, the EBA underlines the importance of the green asset ratio, supported by other KPIs, as a key means to understand how institutions are financing sustainable activities and meeting the Paris agreement targets.

The EBA has also integrated proportionality measures that should facilitate institutions\u2019 disclosures, including transitional periods where disclosures in terms of estimates and proxies are allowed. Background The EBA is publishing this Advice following the Commission\u2019s call for advice received in September 2020. While the Commission\u2019s call for advice is addressed to the three ESAs, it includes separate questions for EBA, EIOPA and ESMA, related to the corporates under the jurisdiction of each Authority, banks and investment firms in the case of the EBA. For this reason, the three ESAs are providing separate answers to the call for advice (EMSA,\u00a0\u00a0EIOPA), although the responses have been coordinated in order to ensure consistent proposals. \u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-advises-commission-kpis-transparency-institutions%E2%80%99-environmentally-sustainable-activities"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0121", "date": "2021-03-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA launches public consultation on draft technical standards on Pillar 3 disclosures of ESG risks", "text": " The draft technical standards provide a framework for ESG disclosures to ensure stakeholders are informed about ESG exposures and strategies and can make informed decisions and exercise market discipline. The standards put forward comparable disclosures and KPIs, including a green asset ratio, as a tool to show how institutions are embedding sustainability considerations in their risk management, business models and strategy and their pathway towards the Paris agreement goals The EBA has developed the Consultation paper in parallel and consistently with its advice to the EU Commission on ESG disclosures under the EU taxonomy, including a proposal for a Green Asset ratio (GAR). The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a consultation paper on draft implementing technical standards (ITS) on Pillar 3 disclosures on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks. The draft ITS put forward comparable disclosures that show how climate change may exacerbate other risks within institutions\u2019 balance sheets, how institutions are mitigating those risks, and their green asset ratio on exposures financing taxonomy-aligned activities, such as those consistent with the Paris agreement goals. Disclosure of information on ESG risks is a vital tool to promote market discipline, allowing stakeholders to assess banks\u2019 ESG related risks and sustainable finance strategy. In line with the requirements laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the draft ITS proposes comparable quantitative disclosures on climate-change related transition and physical risks, including information on exposures towards carbon related assets and assets subject to chronic and acute climate change events. They also include quantitative disclosures on institutions\u2019 mitigating actions supporting their counterparties in the transition to a carbon neutral economy and in the adaptation to climate change.

The ITS will amend the\u00a0final draft ITS on institutions\u2019 public disclosures\u00a0with the strategic objective of defining a single, comprehensive Pillar 3 framework under the CRR that should integrate all the relevant Pillar 3 disclosure requirements. This will facilitate institutions\u2019 implementation and enhance clarity for users of such information, as expressed in the\u00a0EBA Pillar 3 roadmap. When developing these proposals, the EBA has built on the Financial Stability Board\u00a0 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (FSB-TCFD) recommendations, the Commission\u2019s non-binding guidelines on climate-change reporting, and on the EU Taxonomy.

The amendments to the revised Guidelines aim at strengthening the EU\u2019s AML/CFT defences by aligning the requirements with recent changes in the legal framework in the EU, and addressing new ML/TF risks. They also support effective and consistent supervision by competent authorities of financial institutions\u2019 risk-based approaches to AML/CFT. The EBA published today its final revised Guidelines on ML/TF risk factors. The revisions take into account changes to the EU Anti Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing (AML/CFT) legal framework and address new ML/TF risks, including those identified by the EBA\u2019s implementation reviews. In addition to strengthening financial institutions\u2019 risk-based approaches to AML/CFT, the revision supports the development of more effective and consistent supervisory approaches where evidence suggested that divergent approaches continue to exist. The Guidelines are central to the EBA\u2019s work to lead, coordinate and monitor the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. The Guidelines are addressed to both financial institutions and supervisory authorities. They set out factors that firms should consider when assessing the ML/TF risk associated with a business relationship or occasional transaction. In addition, they provide guidance on how financial institutions can adjust their customer due diligence measures to mitigate the ML/TF risk they have identified so as to make them more appropriate and proportionate.\u00a0Finally, they support competent authorities\u2019 AML/CFT supervision efforts when assessing the adequacy of firms\u2019 risk assessments and AML/CFT policies and procedures. In this revised version, the EBA strengthens the requirements on individual and business-wide risk assessments and customer due diligence (CDD) measures, adding new guidance on the identification of beneficial owners, the use of innovative solutions to identify and verify customers\u2019 identities, and how financial institutions should comply with legal provisions on enhanced customer due diligence related to high-risk third countries. In addition, the EBA included new sectoral guidelines for crowdfunding platforms, corporate finance, account information service providers (AISPs) and payment initiation services providers (PISPs), and firms providing activities of currency exchanges offices. The revised Guidelines also provide more details on\u00a0terrorist financing risk factors. Together, these changes will be conducive to the implementation by financial institutions of a more effective, risk-based approach to AML/CFT. The EBA reiterates that there is no requirement for financial institutions to discontinue services to entire categories of customers that they associate with higher ML/TF risk (so-called \u2018de-risking\u2019): Instead, financial institutions should balance the need for financial inclusion with the need to mitigate and manage ML/TF risk. The guidelines can help financial institutions to achieve this balance. The EBA also stresses the need for supervisory authorities and financial institutions to enhance their understanding of tax crimes, as set out last year in the EBA\u2019s Report on competent authorities\u2019 approaches to tackling market integrity risks associated with dividend arbitrage schemes (EBA/REP/2020/15). Legal Basis, background and next steps Articles 17 and 18(4) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, mandate the EBA to issue Guidelines addressed to both Competent Authorities and to credit and financial institutions on the risk factors to be considered and the measures to be taken in situations where simplified customer due diligence and enhanced customer due diligence are appropriate. In June 2017, the three ESAs issued Guidelines on customer due diligence and the factors credit and financial institutions should consider when assessing the money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with individual business relationships and occasional transactions (JC 2017 37). Since then, the applicable legislative framework in the EU has changed. On 9 July 2018, Directive (EU) 2018/843 (AMLD5) entered into force and has been applicable from 10 January 2020. Moreover, new risks have emerged and have been identified in the ESAs\u2019 2019 Joint Opinion. The European Commission\u2019s post mortem report and the EBA\u2019s implementation reviews have highlighted widespread challenges in the operationalisation and supervision of the risk-based approach to AML/CFT. Therefore, a review of the original Risk Factors Guidelines was warranted. The original risk factors Guidelines will be repealed and replaced with the revised Guidelines. The Guidelines will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the EBA website. The deadline for competent authorities to report whether they comply with the guidelines will be two months after the publication of the translations. The guidelines will apply three months after publication in all EU official languages. The EBA\u2019s role and mandate on AML/CFT is explained in a factsheet. The EBA regularly informs its stakeholders on its work and deliverables with a dedicated AML/CFT newsletter; all editions can be accessed via the EBA\u2019s website.

Both consultations run until 23 April 2021. The draft RTS on colleges of supervisors for investment firms groups specify the conditions under which colleges of supervisors exercise their tasks. The RTS target the investment firm groups falling under the remit of the Investment Firms Directive (IFD) and are built on the experience gained over the years in the colleges of supervisors of credit institutions and larger and more complex investment firms groups that have been established in accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). The draft RTS are structured around four main sections: establishment of colleges, functioning of colleges; planning and coordination of supervisory activities in going concern situations; planning and coordination of supervisory activities in preparation for and during emergency situations. The draft RTS and ITS on information exchange between the competent authorities of home and host Member States complement the RTS on colleges of supervisors and address situations where investment firms operate in another Member State through branches or the free provision of services, where colleges may not be established. In particular, the draft RTS specify the information that host Member State competent authorities and home Member State competent authorities shall exchange with each other, whereas the draft ITS establish standard forms, templates and procedures for sharing the information specified in the RTS. Consultation process Responses to the two consultations can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 23 April 2021. A public hearing will take place on 7 April 2021. Legal basis The draft RTS on colleges of supervisors for investment firms groups have been developed in accordance with Article 48(8) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034, which mandates the Authority to develop, in consultation with ESMA, draft RTS to specify the conditions under which the colleges of supervisors established for investment firms groups exercise their tasks. The draft RTS and ITS on information exchange have been developed in accordance with Articles 13(7) and Article 13(8) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034, which mandate the Authority to develop regulatory and implementing technical standards on the exchange of information between home and host competent authorities supervising investment firms operating through branches. Both mandates have to be delivered by the EBA in consultation with ESMA.

The Opinion sets out the EBA\u2019s expectations on the actions NCAs should take to ensure that remaining obstacles are removed from the interfaces of account servicing payment service providers (ASPSPs). National authorities should first assess the progress made by ASPSPs in their respective jurisdictions and, in cases where obstacles have not been removed, they should take supervisory actions by 30 April 2021. The EBA also expects that, in cases obstacles continue to exist following the said deadline, NCAs should take more effective supervisory measures to ensure compliance with the applicable law, including, but not limited to, by revoking exemptions from the contingency mechanism already granted to ASPSPs and/or by imposing fines. Background and legal basis The EBA issued the Opinion in accordance with Article 29(1)(a) of its Founding Regulation, which mandates the Authority to play an active role in building a common Union supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices, as well as in ensuring uniform procedures and consistent approaches throughout the Union. PSD2 applies since 13 January 2018. The Directive requires ASPSPs to establish the access interfaces through which third party providers can access the customers\u2019 payment accounts in a secure manner. Article 32(3) of RTS on SCA&CSC, which is applicable since 13 September 2019, requires ASPSPs that have implemented a dedicated interface to ensure that the latter does not create obstacles to the provision of payment initiation and account information services. In an Opinion published on 4 June 2020, the EBA identified a number of practices that are obstacles to the provision of third party provider services under the PSD2, which are, therefore, a breach of law and that have to be removed by ASPSPs. \u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-calls-national-authorities-take-supervisory-actions-removal-obstacles-account-access-under"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0126", "date": "2021-02-19", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes final draft technical standards on indirect exposures arising from derivatives underlying a debt or equity instrument", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today final draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) specifying how institutions should determine exposures arising from derivative and credit derivative contracts not entered directly into with a client but whose underlying debt or equity instrument was issued by a client. These draft RTS will ensure appropriate levels of consistency through different pieces of the regulatory framework for the calculation of large exposures. As part of the Risk Reduction Measures (RRM) package adopted by the European legislators, the large exposure framework under the Capital Requirements Regulation CRR) was amended to ensure greater alignment with the Basel standard (LEX). These draft RTS propose a methodology for the calculation of indirect exposures for different categories of derivative contracts and credit derivative contracts with a single underlying debt or equity instrument, namely: options on debt and equity instruments; credit derivative contracts; other derivatives having as underlying a debt or equity instrument. In addition, they provide a separate methodology for the calculation of exposures stemming from contracts with multiple underlying reference names. The proposed methodologies are expected to be easy to implement and applicable by all institutions in a standardised manner. The final draft RTS have been developed in a way to ensure that they are compatible with the jump-to-default (JTD) approach under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) and the CRR and the corresponding draft RTS on JTD that the EBA is currently developing. The basis of both draft RTS is the variation in price that would stem from the default of an issuer. The EBA consulted on the draft RTS for three months, and the feedback received led to a clarification, on the treatment of derivatives and credit derivatives allocated to the trading book or non-trading book. Furthermore, the draft RTS have been amended to align the proposed rules applicable to multi-underlying derivatives with a structure (i.e. an index and collective investment undertakings) or without a structure, as well as the introduction of a partial look-though approach for this type of derivatives.

The consultation paper also details the criteria to determine the period of time and the measures for institutions to return to compliance with those limits. The consultation runs until 17 May 2021. The guidelines clarify that any breach of the large exposure limits of Article 395(1) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) should always be considered as an exceptional case. To support competent authorities in their assessment and harmonise the approach across the Single Market, the EBA has developed guidelines with criteria to assess such breaches. Competent authorities should consider at least the following three criteria: whether the breach was a rare event; whether the institution could foresee the event when it had applied a proper and effective risk management; and whether it was caused by reasons beyond the institution\u2019s control. If the breach does not fulfil those criteria, the competent authority should not grant the institution more than three months to restore compliance with the large exposure limit. Likewise, the guidelines provide competent authorities with a set of criteria to determine the appropriate time that they could grant institutions to return to compliance with the large exposure limits. When an institution is granted more than three months to comply with the limits, it should present a compliance plan to the competent authority with a number of measures as listed in the guidelines.

The proposed RTS aim to strengthen protection for end-investors by improving Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosures to end-investors on the principal adverse impacts of investment decisions and on the sustainability features of a wide range of financial products. This will help to respond to investor demands for sustainable products and reduce the risk of greenwashing. Steven Maijoor, Chair of the ESAs Joint Committee, said: The significant set of rules issued today provide a strong basis to improve ESG reporting and combat greenwashing. They strike a careful balance between achieving common disclosures across the range of financial products covered by the SFDR and recognising that they will be included in documents that are very diverse in length and complexity. The ESAs have listened to the consultation feedback from stakeholders and have adjusted the proposed disclosures. Main proposals Entity-level principal adverse impact disclosures The principal adverse impacts that investment decisions have on sustainability factors should be disclosed on the entity\u2019s website. The disclosure should take the form of a statement showing how investments adversely impact indicators in relation to climate and environment; and social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery aspects. The ESAs have updated the list of indicators for principal adverse impacts. The principal adverse impact reporting in the SFDR is based on the principle of proportionality \u2013 for companies with fewer than 500 employees, the entity-level principal adverse impact reporting applies on a comply-or-explain basis. Product level disclosures The sustainability characteristics or objectives of financial products are to be disclosed in an annex to the respective sectoral pre-contractual and periodic documentation in mandatory templates and on providers\u2019 websites. Proposals relate to: Pre-contractual information should include details on how a product with environmental or social characteristics/ sustainable investment objective/ meets those/ that characteristics/ objective. Information on the entity\u2019s website on the environmental or social characteristics of financial products/ sustainable investment objective of the product and the methodologies used. Information in periodic reports specifying: (I) the extent to which products met the environmental and/or social characteristics by means of relevant indicators; and (II) for products with sustainable investment objectives, including products whose objective is a reduction in carbon emissions. Information in relation to the \u2018do not significantly harm\u2019 principle: specifying the details for how sustainable investments do not significantly harm sustainable investment objectives. As the ESAs were not empowered to differentiate the disclosures between financial market participants and products, the RTS contain a harmonised approach to all financial products. Therefore, the same disclosures are required for a very broad range of products attached as annexes to existing sectoral disclosure documents that have different levels of granularity and length. Next steps The EC is expected to endorse the RTS within 3 months of their publication. While financial market participants and financial advisers are required to apply most of the provisions on sustainability-related disclosures laid down in the SFDR from 10 March 2021, the application of the RTS will be delayed to a later date according to the EC letter to the ESAs. The ESAs have proposed in these draft RTS that the application date of the RTS should be 1 January 2022. The ESAs plan to issue a public supervisory statement before the application date of SFDR in order to achieve an effective and consistent application of the SFDR\u2019s requirements and consistent national supervision of the SFDR. The ESAs will also publish a consultation on taxonomy-related product disclosures under the Taxonomy Regulation which amends the empowerments in Articles 8(4), 9(6) and 11(5) of the SFDR. Background On 9 December 2019, the SFDR was published in the Official Journal. The Taxonomy Regulation was published in the Official Journal on 22 June 2020.

Following a request from the European Commission in December 2020, EIOPA\u2019s Board of Supervisors further analysed the draft RTS which was adopted today by a qualified majority of EIOPA\u2019s Board. While some national competent authorities at EIOPA\u2019s Board continued to express reservations on the draft RTS, they supported the proposal based on the further details provided by the European Commission on their approach to the broader review of PRIIPs Regulation, namely that the review will thoroughly examine the application of the PRIIPs framework, including: how to achieve better alignment between PRIIPs, Insurance Distribution Directive and Markets\u00a0in Financial Instruments Directive II regarding provisions on costs disclosure; the scope of products as foreseen by the PRIIPs Regulation; how to ensure that the KID contains the key information necessary for retail investors while avoiding too much or too complex information for these investors; how to allow the creation of a digitalised KID allowing layered information and reviewing the default paper basis of the KID, taking into account the specific challenges for different types of products (e.g. multi-option products (MOPs)); the need for a more tailored approach, such as for MOPs, in order to maximise understanding and use of the information, while continuing to allow for comparability of similar products. Background In July 2020 the ESAs informed the European Commission of the outcome of a review that had been conducted on the PRIIPs key information document. This followed an ESA consultation paper published on 16 October 2019 on draft RTS to amend the technical rules on the presentation, content, review and revision of KID (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653). At that stage, the draft RTS was adopted by the Board of Supervisors of ESMA and EBA, but did not receive the support of a qualified majority at the Board of Supervisors of EIOPA. In December 2020, the Commission invited the ESAs to submit an RTS to amend the KID within a six week period referring to the need to make urgent amendments to European Commission\u2019s Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653. Following the submission to the European Commission, the ESAs draft RTS is now subject to adoption.

Legal basis and background The proposed revised draft ITSs have been developed according to Article 136 (1) and (3) of Regulation 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation) and of Article 109 (a) of Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II Directive), which state that revised draft ITS\u00a0 shall be submitted by the ESAs, where necessary. This change follows a second amendment to the Implementing Regulations, which was proposed by the ESAs in May 2019 and adopted by the European Commission on 29 November 2019. The first amendment reflected the withdrawal of the registration of one CRA and the recognition of five additional CRAs since the adoption of the Implementing Regulations in October 2016. The second amendment, on the other hand, reflected the outcomes of a monitoring exercise on the adequacy of existing mappings, namely changes to the Credit Quality Steps (CQS) allocation for two ECAIs and the introduction of new credit rating scales for ten ECAIs. Two ECAIs, Creditreform and ACRA Europe, have not consented to the publication of their mapping reports. In the absence of a consent, the ESAs published only the outcome of the revision, i.e. the relevant mappings in Annex III of the draft amended ITS (\u201cMapping tables\u201d) together with two documents listing the applicable credit rating scales and credit rating types for each of the concerned ECAI.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today the 2021 EU-wide stress test and released the macroeconomic scenarios. Following the postponement of the 2020 exercise, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year\u2019s EU-wide stress test will provide valuable input for assessing the resilience of the European banking sector. Accordingly, the adverse scenario is based on a narrative of a prolonged COVID-19 scenario in a \u2018lower for longer\u2019 interest rate environment, in which negative confidence shocks would prolong the economic contraction. The EBA expects to publish the results of the exercise by 31 July 2021. Key features of the exercise The exercise assesses the impact of an adverse macroeconomic scenario on the solvency of EU banks. The stress test allows supervisors to assess if banks\u2019 capital buffers, which have been accumulated in recent years, are sufficient to cover losses and support the economy in stressed times. Moreover, the exercise fosters market discipline through the publication of consistent and granular data at a bank-by-bank level, which is crucial particularly at times of increased uncertainty in the markets. The results of the exercise are an input to the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). The EU-wide stress test will be conducted on a sample of 50 EU banks \u2013 38 from countries under the jurisdiction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) \u2013 covering roughly 70% of total banking sector assets in the EU and Norway, as expressed in terms of total consolidated assets as of end 2019. Given the specific macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemics coupled with a high degree of uncertainty, this year, the focus on the different objectives will depend on the conditions closer to the publication date. The outcome might also provide valuable input to make informed decisions on possible exit strategies from the flexibility measures granted to banks due to the COVID-19 crisis, or on the need for additional measures, should the economic conditions deteriorate further. Key elements of the scenarios The baseline scenario for EU countries is based on the projections from the national central banks of December 2020, while the adverse scenario assumes the materialisation of the main financial stability risks that have been identified by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and which the EU banking sector is exposed to. The adverse scenario also reflects recent risk assessments by the EBA. The narrative depicts an adverse scenario[1] related to the ongoing concerns about the possible evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with a strong drop in confidence leading to a prolongation of the worldwide economic contraction.[2] The worsening of economic prospects is reflected in a global decline of long-term risk-free rates from an already historically low level and results in a sustained drop in GDP and an increase in unemployment. Slowing growth momentum would cause a drop in corporate earnings leading, together with a re-assessment of market participants\u2019 expectations, to an abrupt and sizeable adjustment of financial asset valuations as well as a significant drop in residential and commercial real estate prices. A decline in economic growth and rising risk premia could further challenge debt sustainability in the public and private sectors across the EU. The adverse scenario is designed to ensure an adequate level of severity across all EU countries. By 2023, at EU level, the real GDP would decline by 3.6% cumulatively, unemployment rate would rise by 4.7 percentage points, residential real estate prices would decline by 16.1 %, and commercial real estate prices would decline by 31.2%. Equity prices in global financial markets would fall by 50% in advanced economies and by 65% in emerging economies in the first year. \u00a0The 2021 adverse scenario is very severe having in mind the weaker macroeconomic starting point in 2020 as a result of the severe pandemic-induced recession. Notes for editors The EBA\u2019s 2021 stress test methodology was published in November 2020 and is to be applied to the scenarios released today. The full sample[3] of 50 EU banks participating in this year exercise can be found in the following link. The exercise will be run at the highest level of consolidation. This exercise will involve close cooperation between the EBA and the competent authorities (including the SSM, the ECB and the ESRB). Detailed information about the adverse scenario can be found in the note produced by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB)[4]. \u00a0 [1] The convention used in the calibration of adverse scenarios for EBA stress tests is one of \u201cno policy change\u201d. This means that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy reactions are assumed under the adverse scenario over and above what is already embedded in the baseline scenario. [2] These confidence shocks could be triggered by a mutation of the virus, significant setbacks in the distribution or acceptance of vaccines, possible further lockdowns following re-emerging waves of infections and/or other unexpected negative developments in the containment of the pandemic.

The objective of these RTS is to define and harmonise the criteria for the identification of such staff and the use of instruments or alternative arrangements for the purposes of variable remuneration so as to ensure a consistent approach across the EU. RTS to identify material risk takers Risk takers will be identified based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative criteria specified in the RTS. To ensure that all risk takers are identified, members of staff are identified as having a material impact on the institution\u2019s risk profile as soon as they meet at least one of the qualitative or quantitative criteria in the RTS or, where necessary because of the specificities of their business model, additional internal criteria. Following the feedback received during the consultation phase, the\u00a0qualitative criteria\u00a0have been revisited to enhance the application of proportionality. The final draft RTS also clarify how the criteria should be applied on a consolidated and individual basis. Finally, some flexibility in calculating the amount of remuneration for the application of the quantitative requirements has been introduced similarly to the remuneration framework applicable under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). In addition, the 0.3% of staff with the highest remuneration criterion has been included to be applied only by firms that have more than 1 000 staff in order to reduce the burden for small firms. The quantitative criteria are based on the rebuttable assumption that the professional activities of those staff would have a material impact on the investment firm\u2019s risk profile or asset it manages. RTS on the use of instruments and possible alternative arrangements for risk takers\u2019 variable remuneration The final draft RTS introduce requirements for investment firms regarding Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 and other instruments used for the purposes of variable remuneration, to ensure that they appropriately reflect the credit quality of the investment firm as well as, to specify possible alternative arrangements for the pay out of variable remuneration where investment firms do not issue any of the instruments referred to in Article 32 of the Investment Firms Directive (IFD). The provisions in the RTS are aligned with Commission Delegated Regulation 527/2014 on classes of instruments that are appropriate to be used for the purposes of variable remuneration under the CRD to ensure that, in particular, groups of credit institutions and investment firms are able to use a common set of instruments for remuneration purposes. Legal Basis The EBA has been mandated, under Articles 30(4) and 32(1)(j) of the Directive (EU) 2019/2034, to develop, in cooperation with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), final draft RTS to specify the appropriate criteria to identify the categories of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the investment firm or asset it manages; and to develop draft RTS to specify the classes of instruments that satisfy the conditions set out in point (j)(iii) of paragraph 1 of Article 32 and to specify possible alternative arrangements set out in point (k) of paragraph 1 of Article 32.

In the first half of 2020, the volume of total assets and collateral received rose by almost 10% while encumbered assets and collateral increased by more than 20%. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its annual report on Asset Encumbrance. As COVID-19 spread across Europe and activity in primary markets froze, banks made extensive use of central bank liquidity facilities to build precautionary liquidity buffers. In this context, the asset encumbrance ratio rose substantially in the first half of 2020. Overview of key figures Asset Encumbrance ratio Encumbrance ratio of central bank eligible assets Q2 2020 27.5% 49.3% Q4 2019 25.0% 44.4% Q4 2018 25.8% 44.9% \u00a0 The extensive use of the extraordinary central bank liquidity facilities in 2020 has driven up the share of central bank funding over total sources of encumbrance. In contrast, the attractive conditions of central bank facilities have led many banks to reduce their reliance on covered bonds. Repos, whose share has remained roughly stable, were the most important source of encumbrance in 2020. Almost half of total central bank eligible assets were encumbered in June 2020. Nonetheless, banks increased their stock of unencumbered central bank eligible assets and collateral by more than 10% in the first half of 2020. Supervisory authorities should pay special attention to the increased reliance on central bank funding. Although the recent increase in the asset encumbrance ratio is not a concern by itself, banks\u2019 capacity to further make use of central bank funding when necessary should be monitored.

In its decision, the Board of Appeal dismisses the Appellant\u2019s claim as manifestly inadmissible as the facts described do not seem to involve a subject-matter within the remit of the EBA nor of the Board of Appeal. The Board of Appeal finds that Mr Howerton\u2019s appeal merely reiterated the very same complaints which had been raised in the past by the Appellant towards the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), which the Board of Appeal determined to be inadmissible in their respective contexts. As in the ESMA and EIOPA Decisions, the Board of Appeal fails to see how the facts described by the Appellant, and previously filed in a complaint directed to the EBA, may involve subject-matter within the remit of the EBA and of the Board of Appeal. In addition, the Board of Appeal notes that the Appellant, at the time of filing this new appeal, was fully aware of the reasons of inadmissibility of the appeal filed against ESMA and EIOPA. The Board of Appeal, therefore, considers the appeal as manifestly inadmissible and does not allow for any further consideration. Background On 4 August 2020, Mr Howerton sent several requests to the EBA to investigate eight national competent authorities under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. The EBA assessed the content of the requests to investigate and concluded that the facts were outside the scope of the EBA\u2019s remit because they did not fall under any of the Union acts referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. The Appellant was informed of this conclusion by the EBA on 21 December 2020. The appeal against EBA\u2019s communication of 21 December 2020 was filed with the Board of Appeal on 22 December 2020.

This guidance specifies the methodology to calculate the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country groups and clarifies how to monitor this value in order to meet the IPU requirement. The consultation runs until 15\u00a0March 2021. In accordance with Article 21b of the CRD, institutions belonging to third-country groups with a total value of assets in the Union of the group equal to or greater than EUR 40 billion must establish an intermediate EU parent undertaking (IPU). In order to take into account the fluctuation in the value of assets, these Guidelines specify that the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group should be calculated as an average over the last four quarters. Institutions belonging to third-country groups should monitor the total value of assets in the Union on a quarterly basis and communicate the outcomes to relevant competent authorities. In addition, in order to meet the IPU requirement in a timely manner, they should apply a forward-looking approach by assessing, at least annually, whether the threshold is expected to be breached within the three-year horizon, based on the strategic planning of the third-country group and the projections of assets. The guidance is provided also on certain procedural aspects related to the application of the IPU requirement, including exchange of information between the institutions, third-country branches and competent authorities, as well as appropriate timelines for the establishment of an IPU.

Forborne loans were further on the rise while non-performing loans declined. Share of stage 2 exposures kept on growing for loans under moratoria. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its quarterly Risk Dashboard together with the results of the Risk Assessment Questionnaire (RAQ). The Q3data shows a rise in capital ratios, and an improvement in the NPL ratio, while the return on equity (RoE) remained significantly below banks\u2019 cost of equity. The Risk Dashboard includes, for the first time, data on moratoria and public guarantee schemes. Capital ratios continued to improve in Q3 2020. Due to a further increase in capital and contraction in risk-weighted assets, the CET1 ratio grew by 40bps to 15.1%. The leverage ratio similarly increased from 5.2% in Q2 to 5.5% in Q3 (both based on a fully phased in definition). The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio continued its decline, from 2.9% in Q2 to 2.8% in Q3, supported by a contraction in the NPL volume and rising total loans and advances. The forborne loan ratio remained unchanged at 2% and volume of forborne loans rose by around 2.5% QoQ. The share of stage 2 loans in total loans contracted in Q3 by 20bps to 8%, whereas the share of stage 1 loans increased by 20bps. According to the RAQ results, more than 75% of banks expect a worsening in asset quality for corporate portfolios as well as consumer credit. While 60% of the banks expect their cost of risk for the current financial year will not exceed 100bps, most of the analysts estimate it will be in the range of 100-150bps. Loans under non-expired moratoria declined from around EUR 810bn in Q2 to around EUR 587bn in Q3. The share of stage 2 loans under moratoria increased from 16.7% to 20.2% in contrast with the declining trend recorded for total loans. Loans under public guarantee schemes increased from around EUR 185bn to EUR 289bn in Q3. The coverage through public guarantees was nearly 70% for these exposures. RoE increased from 0.5% to 2.5% in Q3. The rise was driven by the contraction of the cost of risk (74bps, down from 86bps in Q2). Total net operating income increased slightly, supported by lower losses in net trading income. The cost to income ratio declined from 66.6% to 64.7% in Q3, mainly due to a further decline in costs. Banks indicate that extension of remote working and the strengthening of related infrastructure, including cyber-security levels, were key reactions to the COVID-19 crisis. Banks also suggest that enhanced teleworking arrangements will probably remain in place in the long-term (around 80%) and they expect increased spending on digital innovation and new technologies in order to attract new business channels (around 60% plan a significant or slight increase of respective spending). The loan to deposit ratio further declined from 116% to 113.6% driven by strongly rising client deposits. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) rose to new heights, reaching 171.3% (166% in Q2). Focusing on the next 12 months, banks intend to attain more senior unsecured and senior non-preferred / holdco debt (close to 50% of respondents for both categories). A rising share of banks also intends to issue subordinated debt including AT1/T2 (around 30%).

The Report presents the results of the EBA monitoring on how competent and resolution authorities have applied the principle of proportionality for recovery and resolution planning in their respective jurisdictions, and describes the current level of convergence in this area. The EBA observed an increase in a number of authorities applying simplified obligations for less significant banks, especially for resolution planning purposes. There was a higher convergence when assessing which institutions are eligible for simplified obligations. However, significant divergences remained in determining reduced requirements for institutions benefiting from simplified regimes where the regulatory framework does not provide detailed guidance. The Report highlights that the vast majority of competent and resolution authorities have used their discretion to grant simplified obligations by introducing less strict requirements for some credit institutions and investment firms. The proportion of credit institutions under simplified obligations within particular jurisdictions varied although the highest was typically observed in those Member States with the largest number of banks in Europe. Just a few EU authorities granted waivers to credit institutions as this is allowed only in those jurisdictions with specific regulatory frameworks for institutional protection schemes (IPS) and credit institutions affiliated to central bodies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The Report also highlighted a significantly improved level of harmonisation in the simplified obligations eligibility assessment methodologies applied by competent and resolution authorities compared to 2017. This was mainly driven by the application of the EBA Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) specifying the conditions for applying simplified obligations that replaced the Guidelines previously issued on the same topic. Finally, the EBA observed significant differences in the determination by the authorities of the reduced level of BRRD requirements for recovery and resolution plans. Divergent practices have been applied in relation to all possible areas in which such reductions could be introduced by the authorities (i.e. a deadline for preparing the first simplified plans, the frequency of updating the plans, content of the simplified plans, information required from institutions and the simplified resolvability assessment), as the regulatory framework does not provide detailed guidance in this respect. Note to the editors and background Article 4(7) of the BRRD requires competent authorities and resolution authorities to inform the EBA of the way they have applied simplified obligations and waivers for recovery and resolution planning to institutions in their jurisdiction. Based on that information the EBA is monitoring the application of simplified obligations and waivers across the European Union. The BRRD introduces an obligation to prepare and maintain recovery and resolution plans, which in principle is applicable to all credit institutions and certain investment firms.

The proposed methodology included in the Report aims at\u00a0 strengthening the stability of the banking sector and avoiding the under-calibration of O-SII capital buffer rates, while allowing the relevant authorities to consider national banking sector specificities. The proposed methodology will inform the European Commission\u2019s further legislative initiatives that could shape the introduction of such an EU-wide floor. With the proposed floor methodology, all EU institutions identified as O-SII will be assigned a non-zero percent buffer rate. National authorities will still retain the ability to set higher O-SII buffer rates than the prescribed floor and are encouraged to do so where deemed appropriate. At the moment, there is no harmonised methodology at EU level to calibrate O-SII buffer rates. Therefore, the recommendations included in the Report do not bear immediate consequences for the EU banking sector and should be seen as a preparatory step to inform EU co-legislators in view of legislative initiatives to design and operationalise an EU-wide methodology for the calibration of O-SII buffer rates. The EBA also published a user-friendly data visualisation tool that will allow stakeholders to better understand and navigate the charts, tables and most of the country-level data contributing to the findings and conclusions included in the Report. Note to the editors The EBA is mandated in article 131 of fifth Capital Requirement Directive (CRD V) to report to the European Commission, by end 2020, on the appropriate methodology to calibrate O-SII buffer rates. The publication of this Report and submission to the Commission fulfils this mandate. The rationale for this mandate is the heterogeneity of O-SII buffer rates set at the national level by relevant authorities. Similar O-SII scores computed according to the EBA Guidelines of 2014 have often led to different levels of O-SII buffer rates, which under the CRD IV could range from 0% to 2%.

The study is based on a sample of 99 banks and has a reference date of December 2019. Under the full implementation of Basel III and conservative assumptions, the updated impact is meaningfully lower than previously estimated, using June 2018 data and a consistent sample.\u00a0 In addition, the Report presents some qualitative reflections on the potential interactions between different elements of Basel III framework and the estimated adverse impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The EBA reaffirms its policy recommendations put forward in its previous\u00a0advice and supports the full implementation of the final Basel III standards in the EU, which will contribute to the credibility of the EU banking sector and ensure a well-functioning global banking market. Key findings of the quantitative analysis The overall impact is presented under two implementation scenarios: the first one, called \u201cBasel III scenario\u201d, updates the impact presented in the previous CfA Reports; the second one, called \u201cEU-specific scenario\u201d, considers the additional features requested by the European Commission in its CfA.. The updated impact in terms of Tier 1 minimum required capital (MRC) is +18.5% under the Basel III scenario, which is meaningfully lower than previously estimated using June 2018 data for the consistent sample (24.1%). The lower impact is due to a reduction in the impact of CVA risk (+2.1% compared to +4.3%) as a result of the introduction of the revised CVA framework and the lower impact of the output floor (now +6.7%, compared to +9.5% using 2018 data). The estimated total capital shortfall is about EUR 52.2 billion (EUR 30.2 billion in terms of CET1), down from the EUR 109.5 billion shortfall in total capital (EUR 74.6 billion in CET1), using June 2018 data for the consistent sample. The reduction in shortfall is driven by a combination of institutions\u2019 improved capital positions and lower MRC. Under the EU-specific scenario, the MRC impact would reduce further to +13.1%, resulting in a total capital shortfall of EUR 33.0 billion, of which EUR 17.4 billion of CET1. The impact differs significantly across the sample. Large and systemically important institutions experience a materially higher impact than medium-sized and small ones and account for almost the entire total capital shortfall.\u00a0 The main drivers of the impact remain the output floor, followed by credit risk and operational risk.

As requested by the Commission, the Report also presents results under different implementation approaches, which, however, according to the EBA have significant drawbacks or are not considered compliant with the Basel agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 This Report also provides an update of\u00a0the EBA\u2019s\u00a0previous impact of the Basel III framework on MREL. Bearing in mind the limited size of the sample and the difficulty to estimate future MREL decisions laid down in the revised Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD2), under the Basel III scenario, the total estimated MREL shortfall, attributable to the final Basel III framework, is within the range of EUR 7bn to EUR 8.6bn. Under the EU-specific scenario, the MREL shortfall would account for around EUR\u00a02\u00a0billion.\u00a0 Complementary analysis on the potential effects of Covid-19 on Basel III There is still uncertainty around how banks\u2019 balance sheets will change as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. A complete assessment of how the Basel III reforms interact with the effects of the crisis is not possible in the absence of data that illustrate the actual impacts once these effects materialise. Therefore, the Report includes an analysis that is mainly qualitative in nature and reflects on the potential interactions between the different elements of Basel III framework and the expected shocks. Note to the editors The \u201cEU-specific\u201d scenario considers the application of SME supporting factors on top of the Basel SME preferential risk weight treatment; maintains EU CVA exemptions and exercises the jurisdictional discretion contemplated in the Basel III framework to exclude the bank-specific historical loss component from the calculation of the capital for operational risk (ILM=1). In addition,\u00a0this scenario considers two measures\u00a0that have been\u00a0frontloaded\u00a0to mitigate the\u00a0effect of Covid-19: the change in prudential treatment of software assets and the change in Pillar 2 composition rules. The methodology used in this Report is based on the previous\u00a0CfA\u00a0methodology. However, some differences with previous\u00a0CfA methodology\u00a0exist mainly due to data availability.\u00a0The main differences include the different (reduced) sample and the use of proxies for selected impacts (e.g. revised CVA framework). In addition, the impact for market risk in this report is based on a \u2018reduced bias estimation\u2019 in line with the baseline scenario analysis in the regular EBA Basel III monitoring exercise. The results should be read in conjunction with a set of conservative assumptions, in particular the assessment does not consider any adjustments in banks\u2019 balance sheets nor authorities\u2019 response to the implementation of Basel III. On 10 December 2020, the EBA also published its regular Basel III monitoring report, based on the same reference date (December 2019). The cumulative results of the present CfA Report are not directly comparable to those of the Basel III monitoring report, as they are based on slightly different samples by composition and size and on two key methodological differences. The more important methodological difference relates to the application of different buffers. Another, less significant, difference is the sequence of estimating the capital requirements for the output floor and leverage ratio, respectively. The latter difference has an impact on the minimum required capital assigned to these two categories, but not on the cumulative impact.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its first Report on progress made by competent authorities with the setting up of colleges to enhance supervisory cooperation for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) purposes. The EBA\u2019s work on monitoring colleges is part of its new role to lead, coordinate and monitor the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) in all EU Member States as set out in the EBA Regulation. Cooperation between AML/CFT supervisors within the EU and globally is key to ensuring effective AML/CFT supervision of financial institutions that operate on a cross-border basis. To that effect, in December 2019, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) published guidelines that require competent authorities to cooperate and exchange information through AML/CFT colleges. Between the publication of the Guidelines in December 2019 and October 2020, AML/CFT colleges for 10 EU banks were established. The EBA staff attended all these colleges to monitor their functioning and share observations with competent authorities on their approach to AML/CFT supervision. This Report provides examples of good and poor practices drawing on the lessons learnt from these first colleges, \u00a0with the aim of supporting the effective and efficient setting up and operation of new colleges going forward. In particular, the Report highlights that there was a good level of interaction and willingness to share the information through a mix of presentations and round-table discussions within the colleges, which contributed to enhancing the supervisors\u2019 understanding of the group\u2019s exposure to ML/TF risks in different jurisdictions. The EBA also found some challenges, which were mainly related to the timely invitation of some observers. This meant that limited or no participation by third country authorities or prudential supervisors was observed in some colleges. Legal basis and background Directive (EU) 2018/843 (AMLD) introduced an explicit requirement for competent authorities to cooperate with each other but did not provide a framework of how this cooperation should happen in practice. To overcome this challenge, the three ESAs published Guidelines in December 2019 (JC 2019 81) on cooperation and information exchange between competent authorities supervising credit and financial institutions. These Guidelines provide details how competent authorities should give effect to the cooperation requirements set out in AMLD, by establishing a framework for AML/CFT colleges. The colleges framework is broadly based on, and consistent with, the framework of colleges of prudential supervisors of banks. However, the framework of AML/CFT colleges extends beyond the banking sector and it is the first time that colleges of AML/CFT supervisors are established in the EU. In line with the Guidelines, AML/CFT colleges are permanent structures that provide a mechanism for cooperating and exchanging information between the competent authorities responsible for the supervision of financial institutions that operate on a cross border basis in different EU and non-EU jurisdictions. The Guidelines recognise that establishing AML/CFT colleges from scratch is not an easy process and therefore provide a 2-year transition period during which competent authorities are required to put in place all elements and set up all necessary colleges on a risk sensitive basis, before the Guidelines fully apply as of 10 January 2022.\u00a0 \u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-observes-improved-cooperation-between-authorities-through-newly-established-amlcft-colleges"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0167", "date": "2020-12-15", "text_type": "PR", "title": "The EBA continues to call on banks to apply a conservative approach on dividends and other distributions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic", "text": " In its 12 March statement, the EBA urged banks to follow conservative distribution policies and use capital for ensuring the continuous financing of the economy. Banks in the European Union have been able to continue supporting businesses and mostly remained with strong levels of capitalisation. However, given that the COVID-19 crisis and the uncertainty on its impact on the economy are likely to continue, with possible further deterioration of asset quality metrics over the next quarters, the EBA urges banks to refrain from distributing capital outside the banking system when deciding on dividends and other distribution policies, including share buybacks, unless extreme caution is applied. Banks envisaging any dividends or other distribution should carefully take into account the resulting impact on the capital trajectory. The supervisory dialogue with banks in this context should, in particular, consider banks\u2019 income generation capacity based on prudent projections, to ensure that banks retain ample resources to withstand a possible further deterioration of asset quality while continuing to support the economic recovery and the financing of households and corporates. Continuing to apply conservative distribution policies is fundamental to ensure the preservation of sound capital levels within the European banking sector and forms the basis to provide the needed support to the economy. The EBA also considers that ensuring the efficient and prudent allocation of capital within banking groups remains crucial and should be monitored by competent authorities. Capital distributions within a banking group should serve the need to support the local and the broader European economies as well as to ensure the proper functioning of the Single Market, particularly crucial in this time of crisis. Taking into account that the stressed conditions are likely to continue in 2021, the variable remuneration of material risk takers[1] for the performance year 2020 should be set at a conservative level. To achieve an appropriate alignment with risks stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic a larger part of the variable remuneration of material risk takers should be deferred for a longer period and a larger proportion should be paid out in instruments. Competent authorities should continue to monitor banks\u2019 remuneration policies, in particular to ensure that they are consistent with an effective risk management and long-term interest of the bank. The EBA will promote coordination among competent authorities as appropriate to ensure a level playing field within the EU. \u00a0\r \t [1] Staff, whose professional activities have a material impact on the institutions risk profile.

The EBA sets out its views on how to enhance cooperation between AML/CFT and DGS authorities. The EBA identifies what information national authorities should receive from failing credit institutions, and how the authorities should communicate with depositors in such cases. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today an Opinion on how to strengthen the connection between the EU legal frameworks on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing, and deposit protection. The proposals set out in the Opinion are addressed to the European Commission and aim at informing its ongoing reviews of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD) and the Deposit Protection Schemes Directive (DGSD). The Opinion is also addressed to the national authorities, to implement some changes already under the current legal framework and ahead of the potential future revisions of the AMLD and DGSD. In its Opinion, the EBA assessed how information about potential money laundering or terrorist financing risks of depositors is identified and transmitted to deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) ahead of them repaying depositors. In particular, the EBA assessed how authorities have cooperated in such cases, and how effective such information sharing and cooperation mechanisms have been in real-life cases \u2013 including where the relevant authorities identified systemic issues with the way credit institutions have complied with their AML duties. The EBA also looked at how depositors, whose payout has been suspended or deferred, or who have been excluded from the payout, have been informed of their situation. The EBA has used the outcomes of its assessments to set out how the EU legal framework should be strengthened to enable and enhance effective cooperation between relevant AML/CFT and DGS authorities in the run-up to, and during, bank failures, where there are money laundering concerns. The Opinion also sets out what relevant authorities should do to minimise the risk of repaying money launderers in the course of DGS payouts, including the requirement to ensure traceability of funds in such payouts. For the time until the EU legal framework is changed, the Opinion also indicates the type of information national authorities should receive from the failing credit institutions, and how the authorities should communicate with depositors in such cases. Legal basis This Opinion has been drafted in accordance with Articles 1(2), (5)(h), 8(1)(h),(i) and (l), 9a(1), 16a(1), 26, and 29(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 as the topic of the correct application of the DGSD, including issues relating to DGS payouts in connection with the AMLD, is in the EBA\u2019s area of competence and as part of the EBA\u2019s objective to play \u2018an active role in building a common Union supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices, as well as in ensuring uniform procedures and consistent approaches throughout the Union.\u2019. In addition, Article 19(6) DGSD requires the EBA to support the EU Commission in its development of a report on the progress towards the implementation of the DGSD. This Opinion builds on the EBA\u2019s existing publications in fulfilment of the mandates above, which are the three EBA Opinions on the implementation of the DGSD, published between August 2019 and January 2020 (available here). On 3 March 2020, the European Commission issued a call for advice to the European Banking Authority (EBA) on \u2018defining the scope of application and the enacting terms of a Regulation to be adopted in the field of preventing anti\u2010money laundering and terrorist financing\u2019. The EBA published the response to the Commission\u2019s request for technical advice on improvements to the AML/CFT framework on 10 September 2020 (available here).

These RTS are an important part of the EBA\u2019 regulatory review of the IRB approach, as they harmonise the supervisory assessment methodology on the IRB approach across all Member States in the European Union (EU). The EBA has identified a number of substantive changes in the Commission\u2019s version of the RTS compared to the final draft RTS submitted in July 2016. The most important change is related to the flexibility for competent authorities to apply any other tests and verifications when assessing institutions\u2019 compliance with the IRB approach. The EBA is in particular concerned about the Commission\u2019s amendments in this regard, as this could potentially hampers supervisory efforts to ensure harmonized use of IRB models. Other substantive changes identified by EBA relate to the assessment of the institutions\u2019 validation of internal models, approaches towards grade assignment and risk parameter estimation as well as any governance and procedural aspects required in the context of the IRB approach. In these areas, the EBA also notes that the amendments change the policy that was developed and agreed by the EBA. As regards the Commissions\u2019 amendments that make it mandatory for third parties involved in model development to provide input into the validation, the EBA has now concerns. The amendments continue to ensure that institutions still comply with the principle of independence between model development and model validation. Finally, the Opinion also highlights a number of editorial and structural changes that are needed to ensure consistency if taking on board the changes proposed by the Commission. It should be stressed, that the EBA work on the comparability of risk weighted exposures (RWAs) have in the past demonstrated that significant differences in supervisory practices can contribute to non-risk-based differences in capital requirements for institutions using the IRB approach. Consequently, the EBA fully supports the Commission\u2019s progress to adopt these RTS. Legal basis and background The EBA has delivered this Opinion in accordance with Article 10(1), subparagraph 6, of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, which requires the Authority to submit its response in the form of an opinion to amendments proposed by the European Commission.

Total assets increase by 7% YoY on the back of a rise in lending and surge in cash balances. Most banks expect their cost of risk levels to stand between 50 and 100 bps for the current financial year. COVID-19 has aggravated the need for measures to reduce operating costs. Banks will need\u00a0to make further efforts to adapt their systems to a challenging technological environment. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its annual Risk Assessment of the European banking system. The report is accompanied by the publication of the 2020 EU-wide transparency exercise, which provides detailed information, in a comparable and accessible format, for 129 banks across 26 EEA / EU countries and for 6 banks from UK. Despite the COVID-19 shock, banks have maintained solid capital and liquidity ratios and have increased their lending to the real economy. However, economic uncertainty persists, profitability is at record low levels, and there are several early signs for a deterioration in asset quality. Overview of key figures CET1 ratio (transitional) CET1 ratio (fully loaded) Liquidity coverage ratio NPL ratio Share of Stage 2 loans RoE Leverage ratio (fully phased-in) Q2 2020 15.0% 14.7% 166.0% 2.9% 8.2% 0.5% 5.2% Q1 2020 14.6% 14.4% 148.9% 3.0% 7.0% 1.3% 5.2% \u00a0 Banks have maintained strong capital and liquidity positions while they have increased lending to the real economy. Capital and liquidity ratios well above regulatory minimum allowed banks to provide necessary financing to non-financial corporations at the beginning of the crisis. Public guarantees and regulatory relief measures helped CET1 levels to recover from the initial hit after the outbreak of the pandemic, while extraordinary central bank facilities helped banks to maintain ample liquidity buffers despite tensions in wholesale funding markets. However, the leverage ratio fell slightly as total assets grew more than capital. Asset quality is expected to deteriorate materially over the next quarters. Banks have booked significant provisions on performing loans that have resulted in a material increase in cost of risk. Although NPL ratios have continued to decline, other asset quality metrics already show signs of deterioration. Loans classified under IFRS 9 stage 2 and forborne exposures have increased markedly. The phasing out of COVID-19-related measures, such as moratoria on loan repayments and public guarantees, will also likely affect asset quality. In the long term, it is noteworthy that, according to an EBA preliminary analysis, more than 50% of exposures to large corporates are to sectors potentially vulnerable to climate risk. Banks\u2019 operational resilience has been broadly unaffected despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. Nonetheless, the usage of information and communication technology (ICT) has grown further, increasing technology-related risks. Money laundering cases still pose important legal and reputational risks. Banks\u2019 structural profitability challenges remain. Low interest rates, which may stay lower for longer than expected prior to the pandemic, and strong competition from both banks and non-banks, like FinTech firms, are adding pressure to banks\u2019 core revenues. The recent fall in operating expenses has offset somewhat the pressure on pre-provision profits, yet these costs might bounce back once the pandemic is over. COVID-19 might at the same time be the catalyst for many clients to become digital customers, hence increasing branch overcapacity. Banks might opt for M&A deals to exploit potential cost synergies. Notes to editors Following the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) departure from the EU, banks domiciled in the United Kingdom are not included in the figures based on supervisory reporting data for the current year in the Risk Assessment Report. For previous years, EU-27/respective EEA pro-forma data are accordingly used to make consistent comparisons. Stage 2 loans as referred to above are exposures for which the credit risk has increased significantly after their initial recognition.

The results do not reflect the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on participating banks as the reference date of this impact assessment is December 2019. Overview of the results Overall, the results of the Basel III capital monitoring exercise show that European banks' minimum Tier 1 capital requirement would increase by 15.4% at the full implementation date (2028), without taking into account EU-specific adjustments. Excluding the leverage ratio contribution, the impact of the reforms is 18.3%, of which the leading factors are the output floor (6.2%) and credit risk (5%).\u00a0 The minimum Tier 1 capital requirement for large and internationally active banks (Group 1) would increase by 16.2%.

These estimates are based on the assumption that Basel III requirements are implemented in full. Notes to the editors The Basel III monitoring Report assesses the impact on EU banks of the final revisions of credit risk, split into four sub-categories, operational risk, and leverage ratio frameworks, as well as of the introduction of the aggregate output floor. It also quantifies the impact of the new standards for market risk (FRTB) and credit valuation adjustments (CVA).\u00a0 The cumulative impact analysis of the Basel III monitoring exercise report uses a total sample of 106 banks. The Basel III capital monitoring report shows the results separately for Group 1 and Group 2 banks. Group 1 banks are those with Tier 1 capital in excess of EUR 3 billion and are internationally active. All other banks are categorised as Group 2 banks.\u00a0 For three Global Systemically Important institutions, that are outliers owing to overly conservative assumptions under the revised market risk framework, the results showing \u2018reduced estimation bias\u2019 assume zero change between the current and the revised market risk framework. According to the \u201cconservative estimation\u201d, based on the original conservative assumptions, the total impact would be 16.7%, with a total risk-based impact of 19.7% and market risk impact of 2.3%.

Under the Withdrawal Agreement reached between the EU and UK, EU law applies in the UK during a transition period until 31 December 2020. This means that EU law will stop to apply in the UK as of 1 January 2021, and from that date onwards, UK financial institutions not holding a valid authorisation from the supervisory authorities in the EU will lose the right to provide financial services in the EU. This statement clarifies previous EBA statements regarding the UK withdrawal from the EU (Brexit) for the benefit of consumers across the EU. Preparedness of financial institutions In order to continue to provide financial services in the EU, UK financial institutions will need to ensure that they offer these services through entities that are duly authorised in the EU. Based on the assessment of the supervisory authorities in the EU, most of the UK financial institutions that are actively planning to continue offering their services in the EU have obtained adequate authorisations for their EU-based activities and are in the process of \u2018ramping up\u2019 their EU operations. This includes ensuring that those entities have adequate staff, management and risk management capabilities, and that they move EU customers and their contracts into their EU entities, where relevant. In situations where the authorisation process would not be finalised before the end of the transition period, supervisory authorities in the EU have requested institutions to implement contingency plans setting out alternative actions until they receive authorisations. Where the UK financial institutions have chosen to cease their activities in the EU, they are required to finish off-boarding of the affected customers by the end of the transition period without causing detriment to consumers. Changes in cross-border payments between the EU and UK After the end of the transition period, EU-based payment service providers will need to provide more information regarding the payer for cross-border payments and direct debits from the EU to the UK, compared to intra-EU transfers, which is how payments to the UK have so far been treated. In addition to the payer's payment account number or unique transaction identifier, the information will include also details on the payer's name and either the payer's address, official personal document number, customer identification number or the date/place of birth. As a result, the consumers transferring funds between the EU and UK may be asked by their payment service providers to provide these additional details. Access to bank accounts in UK and protection of depositors Under EU law, after the end of the transition period, consumers in the EU may maintain their existing bank accounts held with UK financial institutions, subject to the relevant UK legal requirements. However, consumers need to consider the following: If the consumer\u2019s bank account is held with a UK financial institution authorised in the UK, the deposit protection rules applicable in the UK will apply, and these may be different to those applicable to bank accounts held in the EU. If the bank account is held with an EU-based branch of a UK financial institution, \u00a0it will no longer \u00a0be\u00a0 covered by the UK deposit guarantee scheme (as explained by the UK authorities), consumers are advised to check with their financial institution (branch) or national supervisory authorities in their Member State whether such deposits will be protected by the deposit protection scheme in the relevant Member State. If the consumer\u2019s bank account is held with a UK-based branch of an EU-authorised institution, it will be covered by the UK deposit scheme based on the information currently available. However, this could change after the end of transition period and such deposits may or may not be protected by the UK or a national deposit protection scheme in the EU. Should consumers hold such accounts and not yet be aware of the applicable deposit protection arrangements, they are recommended to contact their financial institutions they are holding deposits with or national supervisory authorities to obtain more information. Consumers to seek more information from their financial institutions The EBA has been calling on all financial institutions affected by Brexit, and in particular UK financial institutions offering financial services to consumers in the EU, to adequately and timely inform consumers regarding the availability and continuity of the services they currently provide, including whether institutions plan to cease offering services to consumers in the EU. In case of the latter, the institutions are expected to explain to consumers the impact of the discontinuation of services and the way to exercise consumer rights. Should consumers have concerns about the availability of financial services offered to them by UK financial institutions after the end of the transition period they may wish to contact their financial institutions directly and seek information regarding the continuity of financial services. Further EU sources of information in relation to Brexit Consumers are also encouraged to consult the websites of the EBA, the EU Commission (e.g. European Commission Notice to stakeholders) and national supervisory authorities for communications and guidance about the UK withdrawal from the EU and its impact on the provision of financial services in the specific Member States.

For a securitisation transaction to qualify as an STS securitisation, the Securitisation Regulation[1] requires that the originator, sponsor and the securitisation special purpose vehicle (SSPE) be established in the Union[2]. Accordingly, those securitisation transactions currently labelled as \u201cSTS securitisations\u201d will lose the STS status where one or all the securitisation parties (originator, sponsor and/or the SSPE) are established in the UK after the end of the transition period. This will apply to STS asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) securitisations and STS non-ABCP securitisations. ESMA is working with national competent authorities to ensure that ESMA\u2019s STS securitisation public register is up to date on 1 January 2021. The loss of the STS status implies that the preferential capital treatment available for investments in this type of securitisations will come to an end. This will affect EU institutional investors, such as credit institutions and insurance entities, holding positions in STS securitisations where the originator, sponsor or the SSPE are established in the UK.

The final draft standards specify the value that institutions are to use when computing the own funds requirements for market risk for banking book positions. In this respect, the standards require institutions to use the last available accounting value or the last available fair value for positions attracting foreign-exchange risk. In addition, institutions are not required to perform a daily re-valuation of banking book positions attracting foreign-exchange risk. However, they must reflect the changes in the position\u2019s foreign-exchange component on a monthly basis under the standardised approach and on a daily basis under the internal model approach. For positions attracting commodity risk, institutions are required to use the fair value as a basis of their calculations. In addition, the final draft standards lay down a prudential treatment for the calculation of the own funds requirements for market risk of non-monetary items held at historical cost that may be impaired due to changes in the foreign-exchange rate. In this respect, the standards identify a specific methodology that institutions should use when capitalising the foreign-exchange risk stemming from those items under the standardised approach. Furthermore, the standards require institutions to model directly the risk of impairment due to changes in the relevant exchange rate in the case of an internal model approach being used. Finally, the standards specify an ad-hoc treatment with respect to the calculation of the actual and hypothetical changes associated to banking book positions for the purpose of the backtesting and the profit and loss attribution requirements. This is to address the issue of jumps in the value of banking book positions that may lead to over-shootings in the backtesting that are not due to changes of market risk factors.

This reactivation will ensure that loans, which had previously not benefitted from payment moratoria, can now also benefit from them. The role of banks to ensure the continued flow of lending to clients remains of utmost importance and with the reactivation of these Guidelines, the EBA recognises the exceptional circumstances of the second COVID-19 wave. The EBA revised Guidelines, which will apply until 31 March 2021, include additional safeguards against the risk of an undue increase in unrecognised losses on banks\u2019 balance sheet. With the continued unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that banks continue to provide lending to the real economy while recognising any solvency issues in order to ensure that problematic loans are well reflected in their balance sheets. Consequently, as part of the re-activation of its Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria, the EBA has introduced two new constraints to ensure that the support provided by moratoria is limited to bridging liquidity shortages triggered by the new lockdowns and that there are no operational restraints on the continued availability of credit. Only loans that are suspended, postponed or reduced under general payment moratoria not more than 9 months in total, including previously granted payment holidays, can benefit from the application of the Guidelines. Credit institutions are requested to document to their supervisor their plans for assessing that the exposures subject to general payment moratoria do not become unlikely to pay. This requirement will allow supervisors to take any appropriate action. The EBA is continuously monitoring the use of moratoria and the evolution of credit quality for loans benefitting from the use of such moratoria. Together with the inclusion of the requirement for banks to document their plans on assessing the unlikeliness to pay of exposures under moratoria, these measures will allow supervisors, if necessary, to take action to ensure appropriate recognition of losses. Furthermore, the EBA has enhanced the disclosure requirements related to the use of public moratoria and will soon release, as part of its annual EU-wide Transparency Exercise, additional information on the use of moratoria across the EU banking sector. Background The EBA Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative loan repayments moratoria were published on 2 April 2020 to ensure that banks, while maintaining comparable metrics, would be able to grant payment holidays to customers avoiding the automatic classification of exposures under the definition of forbearance or as defaulted under distressed restructuring. This regulatory measure, which was triggered by the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, acknowledged the crucial role played by banks in supporting ongoing liquidity and the challenges faced by European businesses. With the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic, in June 2020, the EBA extended the application date of its Guidelines by three months, from 30 June to 30 September 2020, and on the 21 September, communicated its phasing-out.

ESMA has also published a final report with new draft RTS proposing to amend the three Commission Delegated Regulations[1] on the clearing obligation under EMIR. Intragroup transactions The amendments included in these draft RTS propose to extend the temporary exemption for 18 months for intragroup transactions. The bilateral margin Delegated Regulation and the clearing obligation Delegated Regulations originally introduced temporary exemptions for intragroup transactions with third-country group entities to facilitate centralised risk management-procedures for groups, while the relevant equivalence decisions are being assessed. Equity options The amendments included in the draft RTS on bilateral margin propose to extend the temporary exemption for single-stock equity options or index options (equity options) for three years. The bilateral margin Delegated Regulation originally introduced a temporary exemption for equity options so as to facilitate international regulatory convergence with regard to risk-management procedures. The new draft RTS for intragroup transactions and equity options are proposing to extend the abovementioned temporary exemptions to avoid undue costs and an unlevel playing field situation for EU counterparties. Novations from UK counterparties to EU counterparties In the context of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the ESAs and other EU authorities and institutions have highlighted the importance for market participants to be prepared for the end of the transition period. These draft RTS reintroduce a regulatory solution to support these preparations. The draft RTS allow UK counterparties to be replaced with EU counterparties without triggering the bilateral margin and clearing obligation requirements under certain conditions. This limited exemption would ensure a level playing field between EU counterparties and the preservation of the regulatory and economic conditions under which the contracts were originally entered into. Counterparties should start negotiating as soon as possible the novation of their transactions which are in the scope of these amending regulations, given the twelve month timeframe to benefit from this measure. Next steps The ESAs have developed the draft RTS on bilateral margining under Article 11(15) of EMIR, while ESMA has developed the draft RTS on the clearing obligation under Article 5(2) of EMIR. The ESAs have now submitted this new version of the draft RTS on bilateral margin to the Commission for endorsement in the form of a Commission Delegated Regulation, i.e. a legally binding instrument applicable in all Member States of the European Union. It replaces the version submitted and published on 4 May 2020. ESMA has also submitted to the Commission at the same time the draft RTS on the clearing obligation, also for endorsement in the form of a Commission Delegated Regulation.

The EBA proposals aim to enhance the efficiency, consistency and predictability of the supervisory SRT assessment within the current securitisation framework. The SRT Report makes recommendations in three key areas where greater harmonisation of supervisory practices would enhance the efficiency and improve convergence outcomes of the supervisory SRT assessments: \u00a0 assessment of structural features of securitisation transactions; application of the SRT quantitative tests; supervisory process for assessing SRT in individual transactions. The recommendations on supervisory process are aimed at facilitating and speeding up supervisory decision-making on SRT, without compromising the quality and thoroughness of the assessment. \u00a0The clear classification of complex structural features between those ineligible for SRT, and those that need to comply with a set of safeguards for a fast-track assessment, will provide clarity to market participants and support an effective supervisory assessment. In addition, the EBA has identified shortcomings in certain CRR provisions currently in force that are significantly detrimental to the effectiveness of the supervisory assessment of SRT.\u00a0 Accordingly, the Report sets out several recommendations on desirable amendments to the CRR that could correct those shortcomings and improve the SRT framework. Legal basis and background This Report has been prepared in accordance with the mandate laid down in the respective paragraphs (6) of Articles 244 and 245 of the CRR. This Report, which builds on the EBA's monitoring activity of supervisory practices in the area of SRT since 2014 and on the EBA Discussion Paper on SRT published in September 2017, informs the Delegated Act that the European Commission may adopt to harmonise the interpretation of those provisions and, thus, the substantive aspects of the EU supervisory SRT framework.

Loans under moratoria on loan repayments were significant in many countries, and were particularly widespread for loans to SMEs. It is expected that upon expiry of EBA-compliant moratoria there might be increases in forborne loans and non-performing loans and therefore institutions and supervisors should monitor closely this effect. Public guarantee schemes (PGS) have supported mainly loans to non-financial corporations (NFC) and were material in a few countries. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a first assessment of the use of COVID-19 moratoria and public guarantees across the EU banking sector. COVID-19 related moratoria on loan repayments provided breathing space to borrowers across many countries with many banks reporting that loans under moratoria represented a significant share of their total loans. The use of moratoria was particularly widespread for SMEs and commercial real estate but were also important for mortgage loans in some countries. While public guarantees were used to a lesser extent, they allowed banks to provide new lending to many companies impacted by the crisis. The EBA will be closely monitoring the evolution of moratoria and public guarantee schemes (PGSs) in the following quarters. As COVID-19 spread in Europe and worldwide, Member States deployed relief measures such as moratoria on loan repayments and PGSs as well as fiscal measures, in order to mitigate the immediate impact of the sudden freeze in economic activity, support new lending and provide breathing space to borrowers. This thematic note provides the first insights into the use of moratoria and public guarantees based on data banks submitted in accordance with the guidelines on the reporting and disclosure of COVID-19 measures, using information as of 30\u00a0June 2020. As of June 2020, a nominal loan volume of EUR\u00a0871\u00a0billion was granted moratoria on loan repayments, comprising about 6% of banks\u2019 total loans and close to 7.5% of total loans to households (HHs) and NFCs. In total, 16% of SME loans were granted moratoria, followed by 12% of commercial real estate (CRE) loans and 7% of residential mortgage loans. The use of moratoria was widely dispersed across countries and banks, with a few banks reporting that almost 50% of their total loans to NFCs and HHs were subject to moratoria. Cypriot, Hungarian and Portuguese banks reported the highest share of loans subject to moratoria. French, Spanish and Italian banks reported the highest volumes of loans subject to moratoria. As of June 2020, around 50% of the loans under moratoria were due to expire before September 2020, while 85% of the loans were due to expire before December 2020. However, due to the second wave of COVID-19, some countries have already announced an automatic extension of the moratoria beyond the year-end. The EBA \u00a0monitors closely the developments. Loans under moratoria are likely associated with increased credit risk. Stage\u00a02 allocation and non-performing loan (NPL) ratios are key monitoring metrics for assessing potential risks. While the NPL ratio for loans subject to moratoria was 2.5% (slightly lower than the EU average of 2.9% for all loans), around 17% of loans under moratoria were classified as stage\u00a02, which is more than double the share for total loans.\u00a0 Banks should remain vigilant and continuously assess the asset quality of these exposures. As of June 2020, newly originated loans subject to PGSs amounted to EUR\u00a0181\u00a0billion, representing 1.2% of the total loans. These loans were granted predominantly to NFCs, which account for about 95% of the total loans subject to PGSs. Banks in Spain had the highest share of new loans subject to PGSs relative to total loans, while banks in France, Italy and Portugal also reported material volumes. Banks in other European countries reported very low volumes, and some countries had none. PGSs also have the potential to significantly reduce banks\u2019 risk-weighted assets (RWAs). The reducing effect of PGSs on RWAs varied significantly across banks and countries. On average, banks reported the RWAs to be 18% of the exposure value for loans subject to PGSs. This compares with an average risk weight of 54% for banks\u2019 overall loans to NFCs. Note to the editors The report provides evidence on the use of COVID-19 measures as of end June 2020 as reported by a sample of ca. 130 banks. The use of such measures has evolved since this cut-off date. Given sample limitations and differences in definitions of reported values, the figures cannot be directly compared with other reports that make use of data published by various central banks and ministries on the use of such measures in respective countries. The analysis of the note looks at the banking sector as a whole and is not intended to provide any bank-by-bank or country assessment. On 11 December 2020, the EBA will publish the results of its Transparency Exercise, and provide detailed bank-by-bank data.

Overall, the empirical evidence does not support the hypothesis that the unwind mechanism has a detrimental impact on the business and risk profile of credit institutions. As the EBA\u2019s analysis shows that the specific impact of the unwind mechanism on the LCR is practically null, it is also not possible to affirm that it could have an effect on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets. Also at country level, the data suggests that the unwind mechanism would not lead to any specific effect on the LCR, except for one EU country. As regards the possible impact on the functioning of the monetary policy, the Report, which is built under the assumption that the amount of central bank reserves has been substantially cut, shows that the specific effect of the unwind mechanism would be immaterial. The EBA also analyses possible modifications to the unwind mechanism and the Report shows that their impact is limited as well. Legal basis and background This Report was drafted in accordance with Article 17(5) of the LCR Regulation, which mandates the EBA to report to the Commission, by 19 November 2020, on the technical suitability and possible unwarranted side effects of the unwind\u00a0 mechanism envisaged in the computation of the LCR. The empirical analysis is based on common reporting (COREP) data covering a sample of about 120 credit institutions in each year, representative of the 26 EU Member States and 2 EEA/EFTA states.

The Report introduces for the first time a set of benchmarks for bank loan recovery and identifies areas where the divergence in the national insolvency regimes is wider.\u00a0 In addition, the Report provides an overview of the characteristics of insolvency regimes that help explain the differences across the EU. The Report provides a rich and unique set of benchmarks on national insolvency frameworks across 27 EU countries, based on loan-by-loan data. Benchmarks are calculated by asset class for recovery rates (gross and net), time to recovery and judicial cost to recovery. The dispersion among different categories of loans and across the EU27 is high for most of the benchmarks in most loan categories. \u00a0 Collateralised lending, including RRE and CRE, generally present higher recovery rates while retail credit cards generally show the lowest recovery rates, but are characterised by the shortest recovery times. Retail loans, in general (credit cards and other consumer loans), show the highest levels of judicial cost to recovery relative to the size of the receivables. Loans to large corporates always present higher recovery rates than loans to SMEs, whereas the time to recovery tends to be similar for the two loan categories. Loans to SMEs also show one of the highest judicial costs to recovery. The legal system that forms the basis of the enforcement framework (referred to as \u201clegal origin\u201d throughout the Report) is a significant factor explaining the recovery rates and time to recovery. The results also indicate that the existence of certain characteristics related to both the legal framework and the judicial capacity are important to improve the recovery outcomes. Positive characteristics of the enforcement frameworks that are common to three or more asset classes are for example: (i) legal instruments to enable out-of-court enforcement of collateral available; (ii) the possibility for creditors to influence the proceedings through creditor committees; and (iii) the existence of triggers for collective insolvency proceedings taking into consideration the debtor's future positive/negative cash flow. Positive characteristics of the judicial capacity that seem important to improve the recovery outcomes include, for instance, the existence of courts and judges who are specialised in insolvency cases, as well as the possibility of electronic communication between the courts and the insolvency administrators. Note to the editors In January 2019, the EBA received a Call for Advice from the EU Commission to benchmarking national loan enforcement frameworks across individual EU Member States. For the analysis, in 2019-20 the EBA and the National Competent Authorities collected loan-by-loan data on loans under insolvency proceedings from more than 160 banks located in 27 Member States. The sample of loans under enforcement comprises of more than 1.2 million loans and is divided in the following asset classes: corporate, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), commercial real estate (CRE), residential real estate (RRE), retail-credit cards and retail-other consumer loans. The reference date for the data is the period before December 2018. The ratio of total assets of the banks participating in the exercise over the total assets of the respective banking sectors is, on average, above 30% for all asset classes considered. This is the first time that individual loan-level information was collected by the EBA across the EU. Some remaining data quality issues, which are highlighted in the Report, suggest some caution in the analysis of the results.

The EBA also reminds institutions to ensure adequate communication regarding their preparations and possible changes to any affected EU customers. Finalisation of preparations and effective establishment in the EU as agreed with relevant competent authorities In order to continue to provide services in the EU, UK-based financial institutions need to finalise their authorisations from the EU competent authorities and fully establish their EU-based operations in accordance with the conditions and establishment plans agreed with the relevant competent authorities. In particular, financial institutions should ensure that associated management capacity, including appropriate risk management capabilities, is effectively in place in the EU, and is commensurate to the magnitude, scope and complexity of their activities and the risks they generate in their EU operations. Financial institutions are reminded of the need to have clearly articulated and appropriate booking arrangements, to meet the outsourcing requirements as provided in the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements, and not to outsource activities to such an extent that they operate as \u2018empty shell\u2019 companies as also provided in the EBA Opinion on preparations for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. Despite significant action by many financial institutions, and the steps taken by EU public authorities to address financial stability concerns (notably the European Commission\u2019s time-limited equivalence decision to give financial institutions 18 months access to UK central counterparties (CCPs) and call upon them to reduce their exposures to and reliance on those CCPs), even the institutions that have already obtained all necessary authorisations and permissions should remain vigilant. In this regard, financial institutions are also reminded to complete the necessary actions regarding the repapering of contracts with their EU clients. The EU supervisory authorities continue to pay specific attention to the preparations of payment and electronic money institutions, where many services in the EU have been provided by UK-based institutions on a cross-border basis benefiting from the EU\u2019s Single Market passporting arrangements. In their preparations for the end of the transition period and ramping up of their EU operations, financial institutions should duly comply with all applicable EU legislation and pay particular attention to prudential, consumer protection and AML/CFT requirements. Payments and payment services The EBA draws to the attention of market participants that any eIDAS certificate issued to UK-based third party providers under the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) - in particular to account information service providers and payment initiation service providers, or TPPs - for the purpose of identification towards EU-based account servicing payment service providers (ASPSPs) will, as of the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, no longer meet the legal requirements of Article 34 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/389, since these providers will no longer have an EU authorisation number and no longer be authorised/registered by a competent authority of an EU Member State. In that regard, the EBA also calls upon qualified trust service providers in the EU that have issued eIDAS certificates to the UK-based TPPs for the purpose of identification under the aforementioned Delegated Regulation to revoke said certificates at the end of the transition period in order to prevent unauthorised access to customer payment accounts held at EU-based ASPSPs. Furthermore, the EBA highlights to EU-based payment service providers (PSPs) their obligations under the Regulation (EU) 2015/847 (the Wire Transfer Regulation or \u2018WTR\u2019) and reminds them that, as of the end of the transition period, transfers of funds to/from the UK will be subject to the WTR requirements concerning payments from/to outside the EU. In particular, under the WTR, PSPs need to provide more detailed information on the payer and the payee for transfers of funds from/to outside the EU, compared to intra-EU transfers where all PSPs involved in the payment chain are established in the EU. This means that, as of the end of the transition period: for transfers of funds from the EU to the UK, EU-based PSPs of the payer will need to ensure that these transfers include, in addition to the information regarding the payer's payment account number or a unique transaction identifier, also information on the payer's name and either the payer's address, official personal document number, customer identification number or the date/place of birth (see Article 4(1) of the WTR). The payer's PSP will also need to verify the accuracy of the information obtained (Article 4(4) of the WTR). This is without prejudice to the requirements applicable to PSPs under Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 (the SEPA Regulation); for transfers of funds from the UK into the EU, EU-based PSPs of the payee will need to ensure that they have the necessary procedures in place to detect whether the required information on the payer is included in the transfer message, and to implement effective risk-based procedures for determining whether to execute, reject or suspend transfers of funds lacking the complete payer and payee information that is required (Articles 7-8 of the WTR). The EBA also notes that as of 1 January 2021, the SEPA rules applicable to SEPA credit transfers (SCT) and SEPA direct debits (SDD) from/to non-EEA jurisdictions will become applicable to SCT/SDD transactions with the UK. In this regard, the industry should take note of the statements issued by the European Payment Council. Communication to customers The EBA is calling on all financial institutions affected by the end of the transition period, and in particular, those offering financial services to EU-based customers on a cross-border basis and benefiting from the passporting arrangement, to adequately and timely inform their EU-based customers of any actions they are taking as part of their preparations for the end of the transition period affecting the availability and continuity of the services they provide, or whether institutions plan to cease offering services to EU-based customers. Information on the cessation of the services to the EU-based customers should explain the impact of the cessation on the provision of services and the way to exercise customer rights, in order to avoid any detrimental effects for customers. The EBA also notes that, should EU-based customers have concerns about whether they may be impacted by the end of the transition period, and they have not been contacted by their financial service providers, they may contact financial institutions. Where practically possible, customers, specifically large corporates and institutions, may consider checking with their UK-based financial service providers to confirm whether they have obtained all necessary authorisations from EU competent authorities to continue to providing services to EU-based customers after the end of the transition period. Financial institutions\u2019 customers are also invited to consult the websites of their national competent authorities for communications and guidance about the UK withdrawal from the EU and its impact on the provision of financial services in specific jurisdictions.

In its decision, the Board of Appeal dismisses the Appellant\u2019s claim as inadmissible as the facts described do not seem to involve insurances and occupational pension funds or any other subject-matter within the remit of EIOPA nor of the Board of Appeal. The Board of Appeal finds that Mr Howerton\u2019s appeal merely reiterated the very same complaints which had been raised in the past by the Appellant towards the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and which the Board of Appeal determined to be inadmissible in that context. As in the ESMA Decision, the Board of Appeal fails to see how the facts described by the Appellant, and previously filed in a complaint directed to EIOPA, may involve insurances and occupational pension funds or any other subject-matter within the remit of EIOPA and of the Board of Appeal. In addition, the Board of Appeal notes that the Appellant, at the time of filing this new appeal, was fully aware of the reasons of inadmissibility of the appeal filed against ESMA. The Board of Appeal, therefore, considers the appeal as manifestly inadmissible and does not allow for any further consideration. Background On 18 august 2020, Mr. Howerton sent several requests to EIOPA to investigate six national competent authorities under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010. EIOPA assessed the content of the requests to investigate and concluded that the facts were outside the scope of EIOPA\u2019s remit because they did not fall under any of the Union acts referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010. The Appellant was informed of this conclusion by EIOPA on 30 September 2020. The appeal against EIOPA\u2019s communication of 30 September 2020 was filed on 9 October 2020.

This Opinion forms part of the EBA\u2019s ongoing work to strengthen the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing in Europe. Money laundering and terrorist financing can have a significant, adverse impact on an institution\u2019s soundness and viability. It can also have an impact on the stability and integrity of the financial system in which an institution operates. This is why prudential supervisors need to develop a sufficient understanding of ML/TF risks to enable them to identify ML/TF risks and prudential concerns. ML/TF risks that are particularly relevant to prudential supervisors include\u00a0those that are indicative of broader deficiencies in the internal governance or internal controls framework, such as ICT-related weaknesses, that criminals can use. The EBA expects prudential supervisors to cooperate effectively and in a timely manner with AML/CFT supervisors to exchange information on ML/TF risks and to assess the implication of those risks for the safety and soundness of the institution they supervise. This applies to prudential and AML/CFT supervisors that form part of the same competent authority, as it does to prudential and AML/CFT supervisors from different competent authorities and in cross border situations. The EBA will include more detailed guidance on how ML/TF risks should be considered by prudential supervisors as part of their overall SREP assessment in the revised version of the SREP Guidelines that is planned to be published by end December 2021 as set out in the Pillar 2 roadmap. Legal basis and background The EBA has delivered this Opinion in accordance with Article 29(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, which mandates the Authority to play an active role in building a common Union supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices, as well as in ensuring uniform procedures and consistent approaches throughout the Union. This Opinion is part of the EBA's wider work to strengthen the link between prudential and AML/CFT supervision, and to lead, coordinate and monitor the EU financial sector\u2019s fight against ML/TF.\u00a0It reflects a specific request in the Council Anti Money Laundering Action Plan of 2018. The EBA has published guidance on supervisory cooperation in the AML/CFT context.

The need for this revision was prompted by the revised framework introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in July 2018 to identify global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) as well as by the new requirements laid down in the fifth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V), which recognise the importance of cross-border activities within the European Banking Union area. The list of EU G-SIBs identified by the BCBS and the global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) identified by Member States' authorities have remained identical. One of the key changes stemming from the BCBS\u2019 revised approach is the introduction of a new trading volume indicator, which adds up to the existing 12 indicators used to measure systemic importance. In addition, the revised standards include insurance activities in the indicators-based measurement approach. At EU level, CRD V has mandated the EBA to develop an additional methodology for the identification of G-SIIs that excludes the cross-border activities of EU banks in Member States of the European Banking Union. The rationale behind this request is to recognise the efforts made in recent years to create harmonised European banking regulation and a common approach to resolution. This additional EU methodology shall take into account the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), which could lead to the re-allocation of a G-SII from a higher to a lower sub-category, hence potentially translating into lower capital buffer requirements. These revised RTS will apply from the 2022 G-SII assessment exercise based on end-2021 information. As a result of the revised Basel framework, also the EBA Guidelines on G-SIIs disclosure requirements have been updated. These requirements apply not only to institutions that have already been identified as G-SIIs but also to other very large entities in the EU that have an overall leverage ratio exposure measure exceeding EUR\u00a0200\u00a0billion. The EBA Guidelines go beyond the requirements laid down in the Regulation and enable Member State authorities to perform the identification and scoring process and disclosure in a timely manner, and in particular before the identification of any G-SIIs. Both the RTS on the identification methodology for G-SIIs and the EBA guidelines on disclosure requirements will be under ongoing review, as the BCBS identification process is subject to regular reviews of the identification methodology. Legal basis The revised RTS have been drafted in line with the new BCBS\u2019 framework for the identification of G-SIBs introduced in July 2018 and in accordance with Article\u00a0131 of Directive (EU) 2019/878 (CRD V) which requires that the EBA designs an additional identification methodology for G-SIIs based both on the existing international standards and on the cross-border activities of the group. The Guidelines have been issued in accordance with Article\u00a016 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01093/2010 (EBA Founding Regulation), which mandates the Authority to establish consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the ESFS, and to ensure the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law.

The paper outlines recommendations for the incorporation of ESG risks into business strategies, governance and risk management as well as supervision. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a Discussion Paper on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks management and supervision aiming to collect feedback for the preparation of its final report on the topic. The Discussion Paper provides a comprehensive proposal on how ESG factors and ESG risks could be included in the regulatory and supervisory framework for credit institutions and investment firms. The consultation runs until 3\u00a0February\u00a02021. The main focus of this Discussion Paper is on the risks to which institutions are exposed via the impact of ESG factors on their counterparties. The Paper provides details on the risks stemming from environmental factors, especially climate change, and illustrates ongoing initiatives and progress achieved on this topic over the recent years. The EBA sees the need for enhancing the incorporation of ESG risks into institutions\u2019 business strategies and processes and proportionately incorporating them into their internal governance arrangements. This could be done by evaluating the long-term resilience of institutions\u2019 business models, setting ESG risk-related objectives, engaging with customers and considering the development of sustainable products. Adjusting the business strategy of an institution to incorporate ESG risks as drivers of prudential risks should be considered as a progressive risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of ESG risks. Also the existing supervisory review processes might not sufficiently enable supervisors to understand the longer-term impact of ESG risks on future financial positions and related long-term vulnerabilities. Therefore, the Discussion Paper proposes to enhance the existing supervisory reviews with ESG factors and, more importantly, to introduce a new area of supervisory analysis and evaluation of the long-term resilience of the business model against the time horizon of the relevant public policies or broader transition trends.\u00a0 Consultation process Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

Legal basis and background Article 98(8) of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRDV) and Article 35 of the Investment Firms Directive (IFD) mandate the EBA to develop a report providing uniform definitions of ESG risks, and appropriate qualitative and quantitative criteria (including stress test and scenario analysis) for the assessment of the impact of ESG risks on the financial stability of institutions in the short, medium and long term. They also mandate the EBA to elaborate on the arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies to be implemented by institutions to identify, assess and manage ESG risks and to assess the potential inclusion of ESG risks in the review and evaluation performed by competent authorities. The feedback received through the Discussion Paper will inform the EBA final Report on management and supervision of ESG risks for credit institutions and investment firms. It will be also taken into account for the EBA\u2019s ongoing work related to the fulfilment of its mandates to develop a technical standard implementing the ESG risks Pillar\u00a03 disclosure requirements included in Part Eight of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR2 - Article 434a and 449a) and to assess whether a dedicated prudential treatment of exposures related to assets or activities associated substantially with environmental and/or social objectives would be justified as a component of Pillar\u00a01 capital requirements (Article\u00a0501c of CRR\u00a0 2), as explained in the EBA Action Plan on Sustainable Finance. \u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-launches-consultation-incorporate-esg-risks-governance-risk-management-and-supervision-credit"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0192", "date": "2020-11-03", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA encourages financial institutions to put the required focus on consumers\u2019 interests when applying Product Oversight and Governance Arrangements", "text": " The Report identifies a range of good practices and encourages financial institutions to\u00a0 use them; Many financial institutions do not sufficiently put the required focus on ensuring that consumers\u2019 needs are met in line with the Guidelines; The EBA and relevant competent authorities will continue monitoring how financial institutions apply the EBA POG Guidelines and whether they make use of the good practices identified in this Report. The European Banking Authority (EBA)\u00a0published today its second report on how the industry has implemented the EBA Guidelines on Product Oversight and Governance Arrangements (POG). It identifies good practices of financial institutions and concludes that many of them do not sufficiently put the required focus on ensuring that consumers\u2019 needs are met in line with the Guidelines. Therefore, the EBA encourages financial institutions to ensure that the interests, objectives and characteristics of consumers are taken into account when applying POG arrangements, in order to avoid consumer detriment. This second Report aims again to examine the application of the EBA POG Guidelines by the industry, but this time based on a larger sample of financial institutions, and in a larger number of Member States, so as to come to more robust conclusions. The review was carried out with 78 credit institutions, payment and e-money institutions across 12 EU Member States. This Report identifies ways for financial institutions to further strengthen the application of the EBA POG Guidelines. It does so by outlining good practices identified in the sample concerning the scope of the EBA POG Guidelines and general governance, identifying the target market, product testing, product monitoring and remedial actions, and the POG arrangements for distributors. The Report confirms the conclusions reached in the first report and namely that while manufacturers surveyed had implemented the internal processes in relation to product oversight for retail products, this was not necessarily done in a way that put the required focus on ensuring that consumers\u2019 needs are met. Despite the objectives of the EBA POG Guidelines to enhance consumer protection and also to address the prudential risks arising from misconduct, financial institutions appeared to focus almost only on the requirements set out in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV). The EBA and relevant competent authorities will continue monitoring how financial institutions apply the EBA POG Guidelines and whether they make use of the good practices identified in this Report. Legal basis and background This Report has been drafted in accordance with Articles 1(5) and 9(2) of the EBA founding Regulation. Article 1(5) requires the EBA to \u201ccontribute to improving the functioning of the internal market, including, in particular, a sound, effective and consistent level of regulation and supervision. [\u2026], preventing regulatory arbitrage and promoting equal conditions of competition, [\u2026] enhancing customer and consumer protection, as well as supervisory convergence across the internal market\u201d. Article 9(2) states that the EBA \u201cshall monitor new and existing financial activities and may adopt guidelines and recommendations with a view to promoting the safety and soundness of markets, and convergence and effectiveness of regulatory and supervisory practices\u201d. In partial fulfilment of this mandate, the EBA decided to address some of the causal drivers of conduct failure that had been identified in the wake of the financial crisis 2008/9. Following initial work carried out in 2012/13 by the three European supervisory authorities, the EBA developed detailed Guidelines on POG arrangements for retail banking products. The EBA Guidelines were consulted in 2014/15, issued in March 2016 and are applicable since January 2017. In July 2019, the EBA published its first implementation report, at the time based on a small sample of credit institutions only.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-encourages-financial-institutions-put-required-focus-consumers%E2%80%99-interests-when-applying-product"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0193", "date": "2020-10-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA launches consultation on revised Guidelines on sound remuneration policies", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on revised Guidelines on sound remuneration policies. \u00a0This review takes into account the amendments introduced by the fifth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) in relation to institutions\u2019 sound remuneration policies and in particular the requirement that those remuneration policies should be gender neutral. The consultation runs until 29 January 2021. The principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is laid down in Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Institutions need to apply this principle in a consistent manner. In this context, the revised Guidelines specify that institutions should implement a gender-neutral remuneration policy. \u00a0The EBA will follow up on institutions\u2019 practices with a report to be published within two year after the publication of the final guidelines. All institutions are also required to apply sound and gender neutral remuneration policies to all staff. In particular, for the variable remuneration of staff, whose professional activities have a material impact on the institution's risk profile (identified staff), additional requirements apply. The revised Guidelines specify all those requirements, and the waivers, which apply to institutions based on their total balance sheet and to staff with a low variable remuneration. The waivers only apply to the deferral arrangements and pay out in instruments. The revised Guidelines also clarify how the remuneration framework applies on a consolidated basis to investment firms and others financial institutions that are subject to a specific remuneration framework (for example, firms subject to the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS), the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) or the Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)) and are not any longer subject to the so called bonus cap. Finally, the sections on severance payments and retention bonuses have been revised based on supervisory experience regarding cases of circumvention.

The purpose of this Report is to inform stakeholders about the implementation review performed by the EBA on TLAC / MREL instruments so far and to present its views and current recommendations on specific features commonly seen in these instruments. This Report follows the same approach of the reports regularly published on CET1 and AT1 monitoring of issuances. \u00a0The Report is based on the review of 27 transactions issued in 14 jurisdictions for a total amount of EUR 22,75bn. In particular, the Report includes EUR 21bn of senior non-preferred (SNP) issuances and EUR 1,75bn of senior holding company (HoldCo) issuances. \u00a0 The Report covers five main areas of assessment relevant to determine the quality of the TLAC / MREL instruments, namely: availability, subordination, capacity for loss absorption, maturity and other aspects including governing law, tax and regulatory calls, and tax gross-up clauses.

In its Opinion, the EBA proposes policy options to address the infection risk when created by such instruments. The EBA\u2019s recommendations aim at ensuring a high quality of capital for EU institutions and a consistent application of rules and practices across the Union. When reviewing EU institutions\u2019 legacy instruments and examining the clauses that led to their grandfathering, the EBA identified two main issues, which could create the so-called infection risk, i.e. the risk that other layers of own funds or eligible liabilities instruments are disqualified. The first issue relates to the flexibility of distribution payments principle, while the second one regards clauses that might contradict the eligibility criterion of subordination. Legacy instruments will need to be subject to different tests to be cascaded down into a lower category of capital or as eligible liabilities instruments without creating an infection risk. To address the infection risk and preserve the quality of regulatory capital, the EBA, in its Opinion, envisaged two main options. Institutions can either call, redeem, repurchase or buy-back the relevant instrument or, alternatively, amend its terms and conditions. In a limited number of cases, where institutions could demonstrate to their competent authorities that neither of these two options can be pursued, and taking into account all the relevant circumstances, the EBA also considered a third and last resort option. This option would allow institutions to keep the legacy instrument in their balance sheet while it would be excluded from regulatory own funds and TLAC / MREL eligible instruments. The EBA will monitor the situation of the legacy instruments until the end of the grandfathering period, and will place particular focus on the use of the proposed options across jurisdictions with a view to ensuring a consistent application. In addition, the EBA will consider the transposition of specific provisions of Directive 2014/59/EU into national legislation and how this might alleviate concerns about the existence of infection risk linked to subordination aspects. Legal basis and background The EBA issued this Opinion in accordance with Article 29(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (the EBA Founding Regulation), as part of its tasks of building a common Union supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices, ensuring uniform procedures and consistent approaches throughout the Union, including in the area of own funds and eligible liabilities requirements, and monitoring the quality of own funds and eligible liabilities instruments issued by institutions across the Union, in accordance with Articles 29(1), first subparagraph, of that Regulation and Article 80(1) of the Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation or CRR). When the CRR entered into force, grandfathering provisions were introduced. In order to ensure that institutions had sufficient time to meet the requirements set out by the new definition of own funds, certain capital instruments that, at that time, did not comply with the new definition of own funds were grandfathered for a transition period with the objective of phasing them out from own funds.

Based on the evidence submitted, the EBA does not object to the extension of such measure, which Finansinspektionen intends to apply to credit institutions that have adopted the Internal Rating-Based (IRB) Approach. The extension will be applied from 31 December 2020 until 30 December 2021. With the extension of the proposed measure, Swedish institutions adopting the IRB approach would be subject to a minimum level of 25% risk weight on Swedish retail loans secured by real estate. This risk weight floor will act as a backstop to ensure that these credit institutions fully capture the risk of credit losses stemming from a severe downward correction in real estate markets. In its Opinion, addressed to the Council, the European Commission and the Swedish Authorities, the EBA acknowledges, in line with the recommendation on medium-term vulnerabilities in the residential real estate sector in Sweden issued by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), that the combined increase in house prices and debt levels could pose a threat to the financial stability in Sweden in the event of a downturn. The EBA also encourages the Swedish authorities to monitor closely the developments during the COVID-19 pandemic and potential unintended consequences. In light of this conclusion, the EBA does not object to the extended deployment, by Finansinspektionen, of macroprudential measures, which will be applied from 31 December 2020 until 30 December 2021. Background Already in its Opinion issued on 28 June 2018, the EBA did not object to the adoption of this measure, taking into consideration its effect on increasing the resilience of the Swedish banking sector.

The proposal aims at optimising and simplifying the reporting process, capturing additional relevant security incidents, reducing the number of operational incidents that will be reported, and improving the meaningfulness of the incident reports received. The revision of the Guidelines also intends to decrease the reporting burden on payment service providers (PSPs). The consultation runs until 14 December 2020. The existing Guidelines on major incident reporting set out, inter alia, the criteria, thresholds and methodology to be used by PSPs to determine whether or not an operational or security incident should be considered major and how said incident should be notified to the CA in the home Member State. The consultation paper proposes the introduction of the new incident classification criterion \u2018breach of security measures\u2019 to capture security incidents where the breach of the security measures of the PSP has an impact on the availability, integrity, confidentiality and/or authenticity of the payment services related data, processes and/or systems. The consultation paper also introduces changes to the thresholds for the calculation of the criteria \u2018transactions affected\u2019 and \u2018payment service users affected\u2019. In addition, to improve the quality of the reports collected, the EBA suggests the use of a standardised file for reporting major incident reports, streamlining the reporting template, and adding further granularity to the reported causes of incidents and aligning those to other incident reporting frameworks in the EU. Finally, and crucially, as part of the changes introduced to reduce the reporting burden to PSPs, the EBA proposes to remove the regular updates on the intermediate report and to extend the deadline for submission of the final report. Legal basis and background Article 96(3) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on Payment Services in the Internal Market (PSD2) confers on the European Banking Authority (EBA) the mandate to develop, in close cooperation with the European Central Bank (ECB), Guidelines addressed to payment service providers on the classification and notification of major operational or security incidents, and to competent authorities on the criteria to assess their relevance and the details to be shared with other domestic authorities. Article 96(4) of PSD2, in turn, requires the EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, to review the Guidelines on a regular basis and in any event at least every 2 years. Consultation process Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

As the banking sector is moving towards a more digital environment, the aim of these draft RTS is to replace the current upfront full deduction prudential regime so as to strike an appropriate balance between the need to maintain sufficient conservatism in the prudential treatment of software assets and their relevance from a business and an economic perspective. The final draft RTS keep a simple approach based on a prudential amortisation of software assets calibrated over a period of maximum three years. These final draft RTS specify the methodology to be adopted by institutions for the purpose of the prudential treatment of software assets, following the amendments introduced as part of the Risk Reduction Measures (RRM) package\u00a0adopted by the European legislators.\u00a0In particular, these draft RTS envisage the application of a prudential treatment based on software amortisation, which is deemed to strike an appropriate balance between the need to maintain a certain margin of conservatism in the treatment of software assets as intangibles, and their relevance from a business and an economic perspective. Following the feedback received during the public consultation, the calibration of the maximum prudential amortisation period of software has been extended to three years. Moreover, the final draft RTS have been revised in order to envisage that prudential amortisation shall be calculated starting from the date on which the software asset is available for use. This would result in a better alignment between the starting date of the accounting and the prudential amortisation, facilitating the implementation of the new prudential treatment of software. Finally, in line with the recent targeted \u2018quick fix\u2019 amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) aimed at bringing forward the date of application of the new prudential treatment for software assets, the date of entry into force of the draft RTS has been anticipated to the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The EBA will closely monitor the evolution of the investments in software assets going forward, including the link between the proposed prudential treatment and the need for EU institutions to make some necessary investments in IT developments in areas like cyber risk or digitalisation.

The harmonised approach to creditworthiness assessment for all consumer credit should cover data and methodologies that build on the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring. The European Banking Authority (EBA) responded last week to the EU Commission\u2019s consultation on the proposed new consumer agenda where it called for harmonisation of the creditworthiness assessment process for consumer lending across the EU. The EBA response focuses on the revision of the Consumer Credit Directive (CCD) and builds on the recent EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring. In its response, the EBA calls for the introduction of binding principles on responsible lending such as an obligation to take into account \u00a0target consumer interests, objectives and characteristics when designing credit products. The response also calls for harmonisation of the creditworthiness assessment across the EU, including the introduction of standards for the data and creditworthiness assessment process. The EBA response builds on its recently published Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, which the EBA had developed in 2019 at the request of the EU Council. The response aims at reinforcing the requirements for assessing the borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness that are set out in those Guideless and, thus, contributing to the Commission\u2019s planned changes to the CCD. Background On 30 June 2020, the EU Commission launched a public consultation on the new consumer agenda that, among other topics, contained a number of questions in Section 3 regarding the Consumer Credit Directive (Directive 2008/48/EC). The questions also contained a series of proposals regarding the harmonisation of the creditworthiness assessment of a borrower \u2013 topic that has been addressed by the EBA in the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring (EBA/GL/2020/06). Legal basis The EBA responded to the Commission\u2019s consultation based on Article 9(4) of the EBA Regulation, which tasks the EBA to \u201cproviding advice [\u2026]\u00a0 to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission\u201d on matters related to the EBA\u2019 consumer protection mandate. The Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, in turn, had been developed by the EBA in accordance with the Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and in response to the European Council Action Plan on tackling the high level of non-performing loans. These guidelines specify the internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms, as laid down in Article\u00a074(1) of Directive\u00a02013/36/EU, requirements on credit and counterparty risk, as laid down in Article\u00a079 of that directive, and requirements in relation to the creditworthiness assessment of the consumer, as laid down in Chapter\u00a06 of Directive\u00a02014/17/EU and Article\u00a08 of Directive 2008/48/EC.

Whereas capital ratios held up well, there are indications that the crisis starts to have an impact on asset quality. With increasing cost of risk, profitability continued its declining trend. The CET1 ratio increased on a fully loaded basis by 30bps to 14.7%, recovering around half of the decline in the former quarter. The rise of the capital ratios was supported by a contraction in risk weighted assets (RWAs), which was due, among other reasons, to regulatory measures like the amendments in the SME support factor. The leverage ratio slightly contracted, from 5.2% in Q1 to 5.1%, on a fully loaded basis, driven by an increase in total assets. The declining trend of RWAs, despite a rise in total assets, indicates also that risk weights of new exposures tend to be lower, like for instance for deposits with central banks and guaranteed loans, which were key drivers for the increase of loans and advances in Q2. Non-performing loans (NPLs) stopped their multi-year declining trend, moving slightly up in the last quarter. However, due to the increase in total loans and advances, the NPL ratio remained roughly stable. The forbearance ratio increased slightly from 1.9% in the former quarter to 2.0%. The impact of rising forborne exposures was mitigated by a nearly similar rise in total loans and advances. Cost of risk also remains elevated during this quarter. The share of stage 2 loans rose from 7% in Q1 to 8.2% in Q2. Looking forward, asset quality remains a key risk amid the unfolding Covid-19 related crisis. Return on equity (RoE) declined further to 0.5% from 1.3% in Q1. Whereas impairments were the key driver for the contraction of profitability, also net interest income as well as fee and commission income declined. The cost to income ratio (CIR) declined significantly from 71.8% to 66.7%. Elevated impairments will presumably remain a key drag on banks' profitability, with Covid-19 impairment overlays playing a prominent role. Revenues might also remain under pressure, driven by the prolonged low rate environment and publicly-guaranteed new lending, which is presumably granted at lower rates than similar non-guaranteed loans. A resurgence of misconduct costs is a permanent risk, not least during times of crisis. Banks might also face challenges related to restructuring costs or the need for investments in information and communication technology (ICT), amid the growing relevance of digital banking. Notes to editors The figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 147 banks, covering more than 80% of the EU banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates also include large subsidiaries (the list of banks can be found here). Stage 2 loans, as referred to above, are exposures for which the credit risk has increased significantly after their initial recognition.

The Report highlights how the pandemic has led to further amplified profitability concerns across the board and heightened liquidity challenges in segments of the investment fund sector. It particularly points to economic and market uncertainty as a key challenge going forward. The impact of the crisis on EU banks\u2019 asset quality is a key concern as significant uncertainty about the timing and size of a recovery persists. The ESAs see a risk of decoupling of financial market performance from the underlying economic activity, and , a prolonged lower for longer interest rate environment which is expected to weigh on the profitability and solvency of financial institutions, as well as contributing to the build-up of valuation risks. Directly following the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, the ESAs\u2019 actions provided for regulatory flexibility, fostered operational resilience, and highlighed the importance of consumer protection. In light of ongoing uncertainties on the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory and supervisory cooperation between the ESAs, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the European Commission remains key. In particular, the ESAs highlighted the need to implement the following policy actions: monitor risks and perform stress testing: risks to valuation, liquidity, credit and solvency have increased across financial sectors. The use and adequacy of liquidity management tools in the investment fund sector should be continuously monitored; foster flexibility where and when needed: supervisors and banks are encouraged to make use of the flexibility in the existing regulatory framework, including use of capital and liquidity buffers to absorb losses; support to the real economy: capital relief should be used in support of continued lending to the real economy in the downturn; stay prepared: EU financial institutions need to be well-prepared for any disruptions they and their clients may face at the end of the UK\u2019s transition period of leaving the EU; supervise digital transformation: it is key for financial institutions and their service providers to carefully manage their ICT and security risks, including when outsourcing ICT activities.

The continued ability for banks to provide lending is of key importance and the EBA will keep monitoring the situation as needed. The payment moratoria have been an effective tool to address short-term liquidity challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the notification on general payment moratoria received by the EBA, the vast majority of EU banks participated in such schemes. Moreover, depending on the duration of the payment extensions, which in Europe has been on average between 6 and 12 months, payment moratoria will continue producing their effects for a while. The EBA guidelines helped banks to effectively \u00a0manage the large amounts of requests from customers wishing to participate in such schemes. However, the EBA does not consider adequate at this state the further extension of such an exceptional measure. It is opportune to return to the practice that any rescheduling of loans should follow a case-by-case approach. The regulatory treatment set out in the Guidelines will continue to apply to all payment holidays granted under eligible payment moratoria prior to 30 September 2020, thus avoiding cliff effects risks of having to reclassify existing loans abruptly at a later stage. Banks can continue supporting their customers with extended payment moratoria also after 30 September 2020, such loans should be classified on a case-by-case basis according to the usual prudential framework. \u00a0 Background The EBA Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative loan repayments moratoria were published on 2 April 2020 to ensure that banks, while maintaining comparable metrics, would be able to grant payment holidays to customers avoiding the automatic classification of exposures under the definition of forbearance or as defaulted under distressed restructuring.

In its advice, the EBA sets out how the EU legal framework should be strengthened to tackle vulnerabilities linked to divergent national approaches and gaps in the EU defences against money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF). Specifically, the EBA recommends that the Commission establish a single rulebook to: Harmonise the EU legal framework in a directly applicable Regulation where evidence suggests that divergence of national rules and practices has had a significant, adverse impact on the prevention of the use of the EU\u2019s financial system for ML/TF purposes. \u00a0This is the case for customer due diligence and wider AML/CFT systems and controls requirements, as well as for those rules governing key supervisory processes such as ML/TF risk assessments, cooperation and enforcement; Strengthen aspects of the current AML/CFT Directive where existing provisions are insufficiently robust or specific, for example in relation to competent authorities\u2019supervision powers in this area; Review the list of obliged entities currently within the scope of the EU\u2019s AML/CFT regime; Clarify provisions in sectoral financial services legislation to ensure they are compatible with the EU\u2019s AML/CFT objectives, for example by making sure that ML/TF risk is addressed consistently across all sectors. With this Opinion, the EBA complements its response to the European Commission\u2019s consultation on its AML/CFT Action Plan, which advises on how to be effective and efficient in establishing a new EU AML/CFT supervisor by building on existing AML/CFT infrastructures.

The Report sets out the EBA\u2019s observations on the efficiency, effectiveness and consistency of the functioning of resolution colleges during the year and the progress achieved in key areas of resolution planning. It also highlights the main areas that the EBA will monitor in 2020, which primarily address responses to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Overall, the Report shows that resolution colleges continue to be an active forum for resolution authorities in the development of resolution plans for cross-border banking groups, where the intensity and quality of cooperation and dialogue has also improved. Key findings of the Report In 2019, most of the resolution colleges focussed on the practical steps needed to make their individual plans more operational. In this respect, the Report shows that work should continue in areas such as the operationalisation of the bail in tool, determining and planning for liquidity and funding in resolution, operational continuity arrangements, maintenance of access to financial market infrastructures and introduction of management information capabilities to support resolution. In addition, the Report highlights that the written arrangements that underpin the functioning of each college should be reviewed to assess their suitability, in particular to reflect the increased prevalence of remote working and the accuracy of emergency contact details. Finally, the joint decision making process generally functioned well with decisions being take n within the prescribed timelines. Areas to be monitored in 2020 For the 2020 cycle of resolution college meetings, the EBA intends to monitor discussion and engagement on: The credibility and feasibility of the preferred resolution strategy in the current environment and the analysis of alternative resolution strategies; The extent to which supervisory authorities, finance ministries and administrators of deposit guarantee schemes are actively involved in consideration of their respective roles; Analysis of the suitability of written arrangements underpinning colleges; The extent to which colleges undertake reviews of \u2018Business Reorganisation Plans\u2019 to assess if changes are required in response to the economic effects of Covid-19. Note to the editors\u00a0 Resolution colleges are fora for ongoing interactive engagement between the relevant authorities (home and host resolution authorities, supervisors, finance ministries, administrators of deposit guarantee schemes)\u00a0in order to plan and be ready to execute the effective resolution of cross-border banking groups. Their role is wider and more significant than the simple process of holding physical meetings or conference calls. Joint decisions on resolution plans, impediments to resolvability and MREL represent core deliverables of the resolution college work as required by the BRRD.

The EBA is of the view that the several changes introduced by the Commission would alter the agreed policy and, therefore, suggests changes with the aim of maintaining the agreed consensus of the originally submitted text. The EBA\u2019s Opinion identifies three substantive changes introduced by the European Commission. The first one is about the deletion of the requirement, which states that the economic indicators relating to one downturn period should be significantly correlated. The EBA is of the view that such requirement should be re-introduced. The second substantive change relates to the introduction of a proportionality principle for the cost of data (Recital 10 and Article 2), which alters the agreed policy. Here, the EBA suggests some redrafting to clarify the relevant data sources. Finally, for the third substantive change, which is about removing the possibility of considering a shorter time series than 20 years for economic indicators relating to an EU member state that joined the EU less than 20 years ago, the EBA agrees to Commission\u2019s proposal despite the substantive nature of the change. In addition, the EBA identifies a number of non-substantive and drafting changes, which, in its view, may unintendedly hamper the clarity of the text. The EBA is, therefore, proposing alternative drafting suggestions. Legal basis and background The EBA has delivered this Opinion in accordance with Article 10(1), subparagraph 6, of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, which requires the Authority to submit its response in the form of an opinion to amendments proposed by the European Commission.

This end-2019 data contributes to the internationally agreed basis on which a smaller subset of banks will be identified as global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs), following the final assessments from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The EBA, acting as a central data hub in the disclosure process, will update this data on a yearly basis and will provide a user-friendly platform to aggregate it across the EU. For the first time this year, the EBA is including the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) of each institution, which will facilitate peer review exercises and broader data analyses. A stable sample of 33 institutions shows that the aggregate amount for total exposures, as measured for the leverage ratio, increased during 2019 by 3.2%, the fastest pace after 2014, and stood at EUR 25.6 trillion at the end of 2019. Underwriting and payments activities increased by 11.6% and 6.1%, respectively while aggregate values for trading and available-for-sale-securities increased by 7.6%. Similarly, total value for assets under custody increased by 6.2% reaching the highest combined value since 2013 (EUR 30 trillion). Conversely, the outstanding amount for level 3 assets decreased by 1% from end-2018, mildly offsetting the significant increase observed last year. Background legal basis and next steps The EBA Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) and Guidelines on disclosure of G-SIIs define uniform requirements for disclosing the values used during the identification and scoring process of G-SIIs, in line with the internationally agreed standards developed by the FSB and the BCBS. To promote a level playing field in the EU regarding these requirements and to increase transparency on the internal financial market, the current level of disclosure goes beyond the minimum standards required by the BCBS, both in terms of granularity of the disclosed information and applicable scope of institutions. Consequently, some of the group-specific templates currently published belong to institutions that have not contributed directly to the BCBS's G-SIB exercise. The Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the specification of the methodology for the identification and definition of subcategories of G-SIIs, and the ITS and Guidelines on disclosure of \u00a0G-SIIs have been developed in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD IV) on the basis of internationally agreed standards, such as the framework established by the FSB and the BCBS. The identification of a G-SII, which leads to a higher capital requirement, falls under the responsibility of national competent authorities and will be updated by December 15 every year. The identification will be based on the disclosure of global denominators and G-SIB exercise results, which are expected to be published by the BCBS and the FSB in November each year. The higher capital requirement will then apply after about one year from the publication by competent authorities of banks' scoring results, thus allowing institutions enough time to adjust to the new buffer requirement.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-updates-data-used-identification-global-systemically-important-institutions-g-siis"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0216", "date": "2020-08-19", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA supports the EU Commission\u2019s call for a more efficient and effective framework to tackle money laundering and terrorism financing", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its response to the European Commission\u2019s Action Plan for a comprehensive Union policy on preventing money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF). In its response, the EBA sets out technical points that policy-makers should consider when deciding on the scope and powers of an EU-level supervisor for Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). The EBA is of the view that a comprehensive assessment of the current EU AML/CFT framework is necessary to ensure that the EU and its component parts are equipped to tackle ML/TF more effectively and efficiently. Specifically, the EBA recommends that the Commission: harmonise the EU\u2019s legal framework to reduce the risk of gaps created by divergent approaches to incorporating EU AML/CFT law into national law; combine an ongoing role for national AML/CFT authorities with an EU-level AML/CFT supervisor in a hub and spoke approach that builds on national AML/CFT authorities\u2019 expertise and resources, and complement this with effective EU-level oversight for a consistent approach with comparable outcomes; leverage on the EU\u2019s existing AML/CFT infrastructure, including the EBA\u2019s policy, data and information technology resources as well as the EBA\u2019s European and international supervisory cooperation networks. The EBA will continue to provide technical input into the debate as it progresses, including on the details of the new supervisory architecture. \u00a0 The EBA will provide additional technical input through its forthcoming response to the Commission\u2019s separate call for advice in which the EBA is asked to define the scope of application and the enacting terms of a Regulation to be adopted in the field of preventing AML/CFT.

These standards cover information on the total loss absorbency capacity framework that global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) have to comply with, and on the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), that may apply to any institution, in an integrated manner. The disclosures aim to provide market participants with the information to understand both the loss absorbency capacity of the entity and their position if that entity is liquidated or resolved. The reporting framework will provide both resolution authorities and supervisors with the necessary information to monitor the compliance with the two requirements. The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on disclosure and reporting on the G-SII requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (TLAC) and the minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). This is the first time that the EBA has developed disclosure and reporting requirements in this area, thus expanding the scope of the existing Pillar 3 and supervisory reporting frameworks in the EU. The EBA sought to maximise efficiency for entities when complying with their disclosure and reporting obligations and to facilitate the use of information by authorities and market participants. For these purposes, MREL and TLAC are presented in an integrated manner, both in the reporting and disclosure templates. The reporting and disclosure requirements are enshrined in a single set of ITS and a mapping between the quantitative information that has to be disclosed and the data that has to be reported is provided. The ITS also seek to maximise the consistency and comparability of disclosures under these ITS with the templates and definitions included in the relevant Pillar 3 standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), in order to reinforce market discipline. The disclosure and reporting requirements on TLAC apply only to G-SIIs, entities that are part of G-SIIs and material subsidiaries of non-EU G-SIIs. The disclosure and reporting requirements on MREL apply to entities other than those whose resolution plan provides that they would be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. The final draft ITS were submitted to the European Commission for adoption. The publication of the technical package accompanying the reporting requirements and including the Data Point Model (DPM), validation rules and XBRL taxonomy is expected in the third quarter of 2020. Implementation and remittance date The provisions on the disclosures on TLAC apply immediately after the adoption and entry into force of the ITS. The provisions on disclosures on MREL apply from 1 January 2024 at the earliest. The first reference date for reporting in accordance with the ITS is the 30 June 2021 (reporting framework 3.0) both for MREL and TLAC.

The consultation runs until 31 October 2020.Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is crucial for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Therefore, uncovering any involvement of credit institutions and investment firms in money laundering and terrorist financing can have an impact on the viability and trust in the financial system. In this context, the draft joint Guidelines clarify that the knowledge, experience and skill requirements are important aspects in the fit and proper assessment of members of the management body and key function holders as they contribute to identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risks.These draft joint Guidelines also clarify that being a member of affiliated companies or affiliated entities does not in itself represent an obstacle for a member of the management body to acting with independence of mind.The Guidelines further specify that a gender-balanced composition of the management body is of particular importance. Institutions should respect the principle of equal opportunities for any gender and take measures to improve a more gender-balanced composition of staff in management positions.The draft joint Guidelines also take into account the recovery and resolution framework introduced by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and provide further guidance in this regard. As part of early intervention measures and during resolution, the suitability of newly appointed members of the management body and of the management body collectively is relevant and requires an assessment.\u00a0Finally, the draft joint Guidelines take into account the new legislative framework for investment firms adopted in 2019 for the identification of the investment firms subject to the various guidelines.Consultation processThe EBA and the ESMA invite stakeholders to send comments solely on the amendments to the joint EBA and ESMA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders as shown in the tracked changes version.

The updated data shows that the impact of COVID-19 was mainly reflected in a contraction of banks\u2019 capital ratios and profitability, the cost of risk increased, whereas non-performing loans (NPL) ratios remained stable, confirming that the impact of the pandemic on asset quality can be delayed. The EBA also published a thematic note on leveraged finance, which highlights that the expansion of this market segment in recent years has come along with a significant easing of credit standards. Key parameters and trends of the Risk Dashboard and RAQ The average CET1 ratio fell to 14.6%, which is 40bps down compared to EU27 pro forma data for Q4\u00a02019. The contraction was driven by a 1.8% increase in risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and a 1.4% decline in capital. The latter was mainly due to a reduction in the other comprehensive income (OCI) reserve as a result of valuation effects. The increase in RWAs was largely due to a rise in its credit risk component, not least supported by an increase in loans and advances, in particular those to non-financial corporates (+3% quarter over quarter [QoQ]). Loans to households fell by 1.3%. Banks\u2019 average return on equity (RoE) decreased to 1.3% (5.9% for EU27 pro forma data in Q4 2019). Total net operating income dropped by 5.4%, not least driven by a contraction in net trading income, and operating expenses increased by 5.2% QoQ. This resulted in a rise of the cost to income ratio to 71.7% (64.4% for EU27 pro forma data in Q4 2019), which is the highest value for years. According to the RAQ results, the outlook is similarly bleak, with nearly half of the banks not expecting any improvement in their profitability in the next 6 to 12 months, despite the already subdued RoE level. Costs of risk grew significantly from 50bps to 81bps on an annualised basis, showing a rising dispersion among banks. It came in parallel to a rise in stage 2 loans (from 6.5% for EU27 pro forma data in Q4 2019 to 7%) and in banks\u2019 coverage ratio of NPLs (from 45.8% for EU27 pro forma data in Q4 2019 to 46%). The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio remained broadly unchanged, at 3% in Q1 2020, slightly down from 3.1% for EU27 pro forma data in Q4. On a segment level, the NPL ratio for non-financial corporates (NFC) exposures was 5.1%, with CRE and SME loans at 7.6% (down from 7.7%) and 7.7% (down from 7.9%; all for EU27 pro forma data in Q4 2019), respectively. For mortgage loans, the NPL ratio was stable at 2.8%. The RAQ results show a substantial increase of banks\u2019 responses pointing to a deterioration in asset quality. This holds for all asset classes, with around 60% of banks expecting a worsening in the asset quality of SMEs followed by corporate, consumer credit and CRE (around 50% of the banks). Banks\u2019 liquidity positions did not show any deterioration in Q1 2020. Despite the increase in drawings of credit lines and market tensions, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) remained roughly stable at 148.9% (148.2% for EU27 pro forma data in Q4 2019). The massive use of central bank funding, for which collateral needs to be provided, has brought up the asset encumbrance ratio to 26.7% (25% for EU27 pro forma data in Q4 2019). Focusing on the next 12 months, banks intend to attain mainly more senior non-preferred and senior holding company (HoldCo) debt (both as one single category in the survey) and senior unsecured (around 40% of respondents for both categories), according to the RAQ results. Thematic note on leveraged finance The note highlights that borrowers\u2019 indebtedness has risen materially while loan maintenance covenants have been relaxed. These vulnerabilities and the inherent risks of leveraged finance led to a sharp contraction in the market during the COVID-19 outbreak. For a sample of 26 large EU/EEA banks, the overall exposure to leveraged finance amounts to EUR 400bn (2.5% of their total assets), concentrated in a few large and highly interconnected institutions. The main exposure is through leveraged loans while exposures to high yield bonds and CLOs are comparatively small. Banks might also be directly or indirectly exposed to leveraged finance investors to which they provide credit lines or prime brokerage services or to which they have legal or reputational ties. Notes to editors The figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 147 banks, covering more than 80% of the EU/EEA banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates also include large subsidiaries (the list of banks can be found here). The figures related to the Risk Dashboard refer to the EU27 for Q1 2020 and are compared, where appropriate, to EU27 pro forma data for Q4 2019. The results of the RAQ are significantly influenced by the timing of submission of the responses. In particular, some of the respondents prepared their answers at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe, while others responded at a time when the outbreak was rapidly spreading across Europe. As a result, some banks already partially considered the impact of the pandemic in their responses, whereas others did not.

Financial institutions wishing to operate in the EU and offer services to their EU customers should ensure they have obtained the necessary authorisations and effectively establish themselves before the end of the transition period. Financial institutions affected by the UK withdrawal from the EU, should provide adequate information to their EU customers regarding the availability of services after the end of the transition period. The European Banking Authority (EBA) recalls the importance of adequate preparations by financial institutions for the end of the transition period between the EU and UK. The EBA calls on the institutions to finalise the full execution of their contingency plans in accordance with the conditions agreed with the relevant competent authorities and ensure adequate communication to concerned EU customers. The EBA draws the attention of financial institutions that the transitional arrangements agreed by the EU and the UK in the context of the UK withdrawal from the EU will end on 31 December 2020. \u00a0 As also noted in the recent European Commission Notice to stakeholders, published on 7 July 2020, this means that starting from 1 January 2021 financial institutions based in \u00a0the UK and not holding valid authorisation from the EU competent authorities will lose their authorisation to provide services in the EU. Finalisation of preparations and effective establishment in the EU as agreed with relevant competent authorities In order to continue to provide services in the EU, relevant UK-based financial institutions need to ensure that they have appropriate authorisations from the EU competent authorities in place, including for their existing branches already operating in the EU, and fully establish those operations. \u00a0In particular, financial institutions should ensure that associated management capacity, including appropriate technical risk management capabilities, is effectively in place ahead of time, and is commensurate to the magnitude, scope and complexity of their activities, to allow for effective and efficient management of risks they generate. Moreover, financial institutions should not outsource activities to such an extent that they operate as \u2018empty shell\u2019 companies, but are expected to increase their EU footprint, including their local resources, proportionally to the amount of business carried out in and from the EU. Financial institutions should have clearly articulated and appropriate booking arrangements as also provided in the EBA Opinion on preparations for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. Despite significant action by many financial institutions, there is no room for complacency even for those institutions that have already obtained all necessary authorisations and permissions. Financial institutions should pay attention to a number of areas where further action stills needs to be taken. In particular these include changing and moving contracts and clients, systemic exposures to UK-based financial market infrastructures and access to funding markets, including possible related capital impacts. Institutions should also assess and take necessary actions to address any impacts on rights and obligations of their existing contracts, in particular derivative contracts. In their preparations for the end of \u00a0the transition period and ramping up their EU operations, financial institutions should duly comply with all applicable EU legislation and pay particular attention to prudential, consumer protection and AML/CFT requirements. Preparedness of payment and electronic money institutions Contingency plans remain especially relevant for payment and electronic money institutions, where many services in the EU have been provided by the UK-based institutions on a cross-border basis benefiting from the EU passporting arrangements. In particular, the EBA warns UK-authorised payment and electronic money institutions wishing to continue to offer services to EU-based customers that it is illegal for them to provide payment or electronic money services in the EU after 31 December 2020, unless they have been adequately authorised beforehand by an EU competent authority. As a condition of authorisation, relevant UK-based payment and electronic money institutions are required to submit application documents that are compliant with the EBA Guidelines on authorisation and registration under the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). The late submission of application does not guarantee that authorisation will be granted prior to 1 January 2021 as the timeline for the completion for a new authorisation may vary significantly based on the nature, scale and complexity of the service to be provided and the quality of the application submitted. Furthermore, the submission of an application alone without receiving actual authorisation does not grant rights to continue providing payment or electronic money services after 31 December 2020 on a cross-border basis. Therefore, UK-based payment and electronic money institutions that are not properly authorised will be required to cease their activities in the EU or otherwise risk enforcement actions. Furthermore, account information service providers (AISPs) and payment initiation service providers (PISPs) registered/authorised in the UK will no longer be entitled to access customers\u2019 payment accounts held at the EU payment service providers and their PSD2 eIDAS certificates under Article 34 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/389 will be revoked. Communication to customers The EBA is calling on all financial institutions affected by the UK withdrawal from the EU, and in particular, those offering financial services to the EU-based customers on a cross-border basis and benefiting from the passporting arrangement, to adequately inform their EU customers on any relevant actions undertaken as part of their contingency planning affecting the availability and continuity of such services, or whether institutions plan to cease offering services to the EU-based customers after the end of the transition period. Institutions ceasing their activity should inform their EU-based customers in due time before the cessation about the effect of cessation on the provision of services and the way to exercise their rights, in order to avoid any detrimental effects for clients. The EBA also notes that, should EU-based customers have concerns about whether they may be impacted by the UK withdrawal from the EU, and they have not been contacted by their financial service provides until now, they have the right to contact financial institutions and their respective competent authorities directly. To this end, financial institutions should ensure adequate support and communication channels for the EU-based customers requesting information or assistance. Background The EBA had supported the preparation of the financial institutions for the UK withdrawal from the EU, and in particular considering a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario through a series of dedicated Opinions and communication statements. All of the messages highlighted in these Opinions and communications remain valid in light of the end of the transition period: In October 2017, the Opinion on issues related to the UK withdrawal from the EU focused on the application of the EU prudential framework for the financial institutions affected by such withdrawal, in particular in relation to (i) authorisations; (ii) internal models (iii) internal governance, outsourcing, risk transfers and \u2018empty shell\u2019 companies (iv) resolution framework; and (v) deposit guarantee schemes. In June 2018, in the Opinion on preparations for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, the EBA focused on the risks posed by the seeming lack of adequate contingency preparations by financial institutions with a view to ensure that they (1) establish whether they have direct or indirect exposures to the UK, and (2) consider the risks concerned, and associated mitigating action and contingency plans, and duly execute their contingency plans. In December 2018, through a communication, the EBA noted progress made by the financial institutions in preparations for a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, but called for more action, in particular, in informing their EU-based customer. In March 2019, the third EBA Brexit-related Opinion focused on deposit protection issues and the need to ensure adequate coverage and protection of customers\u2019 deposits held in branches of UK credit institutions in the EU, as well as the provision of adequate information to such depositors. In October 2019, in a dedicated communication, the EBA stressed the need for financial institutions to ensure the execution of their contingency plans and their establishment in the EU in accordance with the plans agreed with their respective competent authorities. Furthermore, the EBA stressed the need for Brexit-affected institutions to ensure adequate communication of Brexit-related risks, plans and changes to their EU customers.

To fulfil this mandate the EBA launched a questionnaire addressed to all European banks and a call for case studies to collect evidence on reporting costs as well as industry views on ways to reduce such costs and make the supervisory reporting more efficient. The EBA expects the responses to the questionnaires and case studies in October 2020.The questionnaire addressed to all EEA credit institutions and the call for fact-finding case studies are essential elements in the EBA work of assessing the cost of compliance with the supervisory reporting requirements.The cost of compliance study focuses on (1) understanding the actual reporting costs incurred by institutions in relation to supervisory reporting, and in particular in relation to the EBA implementing technical standards (ITS) on supervisory reporting, (2) assessing the effects of a reduction of some specific reporting requirements on costs and supervisory effectiveness; and (3) assessing whether the reporting costs were proportionate with regard to the benefits delivered.The final report to be developed by the EBA following the analysis of the industry responses will include recommendations on how to reduce reporting costs for the banking industry as a whole and, in particular, for small and non-complex institutions by looking at both technological improvements and reducing some reporting requirements, where the costs outweigh the benefits.The questionnaire and next stepsTo deliver on mandate, the EBA needs to collect quantitative and qualitative information on the historical reporting costs and benefits of reporting, as well as the evidence-based views on possible changes to the reporting requirements or processes aimed at reducing the cost and increasing efficiencies.The questionnaire launched today aims to understand the reporting costs, their cost drivers as well as the benefits and to identify challenging areas of reporting. It also looks into the effectiveness of proportionality measures put in place in the past and first ideas on how to make reporting even more efficient and proportionate in the future.Following the discussion with various EU-level and national industry trade bodies, the EBA has split the questionnaire into two parts with different deadlines for responses, in order to take due account of the priorities and challenges faced by the institutions in the current COVID-19 environment. Responses to the qualitative questions are expected by 1 October 2020, while responses to the quantitative questions as well as the submission of case studies are expected by 31 October 2020.Answering the questionnaire and submitting case studies are of voluntary nature. The EBA, however, would appreciate wide industry participation to ensure that the input into the analysis, and thus the basis for developing the recommendations, is of good quality and representative for the EU banking sector.Legal basis and backgroundThe EBA is mandated by Article 430(8) of the CRR to measure the costs institutions incur when complying with the reporting requirements set out in the EBA\u2019s ITS on supervisory reporting. Such reporting costs should be assessed since the introduction of the common supervisory reporting in the EU in 2013. The EBA is also asked to assess whether these reporting costs are proportionate with regard to the benefits delivered for the purposes of prudential supervision and make recommendations on how to reduce the reporting cost at least for small and non-complex institutions. The findings from this analysis should be formulated in a report and delivered to the European Commission and European Parliament in 2021.The EBA has set up a dedicated page on its website \u00a0and email address cost.of.compliance@eba.europa.eu to support the cost of compliance exercise.

The data shows that in 2018, the number of high earners in EU banks receiving a remuneration of more than EUR 1 million increased slightly by 1.58%, from 4 861 in 2017 to 4\u00a0938 in 2018. Over a longer period of time, the number of high earners increased significantly (+44.09%), from 3\u00a0427 in 2010 to 4\u00a0938 in 2018. The average ratio of variable to fixed remuneration for all high earners in the EU/EEA increased over time from 127% in 2014 to 139% in 2018. The observed remuneration levels of high earners reached up to EUR 39 million.The number of identified staff decreased significantly from 53\u00a0382 in 2016 to 47\u00a0596 (\u201310.83%) in 2017 and 47\u00a0154 in 2018 (\u20130.93%). In 2018, overall only 1.73%, and in 2017 only 1.76%, of all staff in institutions were identified staff, which represents a material reduction compared to 2.00% in 2016.After an increase from 57.09% in 2016 to 66.62% in 2017, the average ratio of variable to fixed remuneration decreased to 62.84% in 2018. The average remuneration for identified staff increased by 12.59% from 2016 to 2017 and by 0.28% from 2017 to 2018. The strong increase in 2017 goes hand in hand with the reduction of the number of identified staff in a few institutions that resulted in an overall more senior composition of identified staff.The average effective ratio between the variable and fixed component for all identified staff increased strongly from 57.1% in 2016 to 66.62% in 2017 and decreased slightly in 2018 to 62.84% (2015: 62.2% and 2014: 65.5%). Overall, there was an increase in the number of institutions where shareholders had approved the use of ratios for the variable to fixed remuneration of above 100%.As in previous years, the Report shows that remuneration practices within institutions were not sufficiently harmonised. In particular, the application of deferral and pay out in instruments differed significantly across Member States and institutions. This is mainly due to differences in the national implementation of Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive \u2013 CRD) that in many cases allow for waivers of these provisions when certain criteria are met. Following the amendments of CRD, which will apply as of the end of 2020, a higher degree of harmonisation is expected.Legal basis and next stepsUnder Article 75 CRD, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is required to benchmark remuneration trends at Union level and to publish aggregated data on high earners earning more than one million euro per financial year.

The aim of these Guidelines is to establish a harmonised framework for the application of the structural FX waiver, which will allow its consistent application going forward. The Guidelines will be applicable from 1 January 2022, one year later than originally envisaged to ensure that institutions have time to prepare for the introduction of the requirements.The structural FX provision, as laid down in Article 352(2) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), allows Competent Authorities to authorise, on an ad hoc basis, the exclusion of FX-risk positions deliberately taken by firms to hedge against the adverse effect of exchange rates on capital ratios from the calculation of the net open currency positions where those positions are of a structural nature. Considering that the application of the waiver can have a significant impact on capital requirements, these Guidelines identify objective criteria to assist Competent Authorities in their assessment of the structural nature of a foreign-exchange position and to understand whether such position has been deliberately taken for hedging the capital ratio.The Guidelines have been developed considering also changes to the market risk framework introduced in the CRR2 and the new structural FX treatment envisaged in the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) standards. \u00a0As a result, these Guidelines have been designed in a way that institutions will not be required to ask for a new permission once they will switch to the FRTB framework for computing the own funds requirements for market risk.Legal Basis and backgroundThe EBA has developed the Guidelines on its own initiative, in accordance with Article 16 of its founding Regulation, which mandates the Authority to issue guidelines and recommendations addressed to competent authorities or financial institutions with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the ESFS, and to ensuring the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law.These Guidelines set out the criteria under which a position in the foreign currency should be considered as structural and taken for the purpose of hedging the capital ratio in accordance with Article 352(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR).In June 2017, the EBA published a Discussion Paper on Structural FX to gather feedback on current stakeholders' practices and interpretations of the Structural FX provision. In January 2019, the final Basel FRTB standards were published setting out a new provision with respect to the Structural FX treatment. In October 2019, the EBA published a Consultation Paper on which these Guidelines are based.

The EBA is committed to securing technology neutrality in regulatory and supervisory approaches and strongly supports the Commission\u2019s initiative towards a new Digital Finance Strategy. The EBA identifies in its response a wide range of possible EU-level actions to support the scaling of innovative technology cross-border whilst ensuring high standards of consumer protection and financial sector resilience. The EBA looks forward to the publication of the Digital Finance Strategy and stands ready to play its role in optimising the EU Single Market for digital finance.The EBA highlights in its response the importance of technological neutrality in regulatory and supervisory approaches as a means to facilitate innovation in the financial sector and support scaling cross-border. This requires comprehensive and ongoing monitoring of the application of innovative technologies to enable the timely identification of opportunities and risks and adjustments as appropriate to regulatory and supervisory approaches.In this context, the EBA supports proposed enhancements to coordination mechanisms, such as the EBA\u2019s FinTech Knowledge Hub and the European Forum for Innovation Facilitators (EFIF), to facilitate a stronger dialogue between industry and regulatory and supervisory authorities on innovation-related issues.The EBA also supports the European Commission\u2019s proposed initiatives, and identifies additional actions, to:promote consumer financial education and digital and financial literacy;develop a high-level AI principle-based framework to serve as an appropriate foundation for the wider use of AI in the financial services;support the scaling of RegTech and SupTech initiatives and facilitate \u2018machine readability\u2019 and the standardisation of concepts, definitions and reporting obligations across EU financial services legislation;further harmonise customer due diligence (CDD) processes where possible and investigate potential models (including public and private sector and hybrid models) for efficient, robust and trusted digital identity verification.Legal basis and backgroundThe response has been prepared pursuant to Article 9(4) of the EBA's Founding Regulation, which mandates the Authority to establish a Committee on financial innovation \u2018which brings together all relevant competent national and supervisory authorities with a view to achieving a coordinated approach to the regulatory and supervisory treatment of new or innovative financial activities and providing advice for the Authority to present to the European Parliament, Council and the European Commission'.In April 2020, the European Commission published its consultation on a new Digital Finance Strategy for Europe/FinTech Action Plan.

The objective is to further enhance crisis management tools available for competent authorities in addition to well-established and widely used supervisory powers laid down in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and in the Single Supervisory Mechanism Regulation (SSMR). \u00a0\u00a0The BRRD introduced early intervention measures (EIMs) to expand the existing set of powers available to supervisors towards institutions in difficulties. While monitoring the application of EIMs in 2015-2018, the EBA observed a limited use of EIMs across the European Union (EU) during that period. Instead of EIMs, the competent authorities often preferred to apply other pre-BRRD supervisory powers available to them.The EBA investigated the reasons for these supervisory practices. While recognising that EIMs could be successfully implemented under the existing regulatory framework, the EBA identified some challenges in their application, and is now putting for discussion potential solutions aimed at enhancing the framework.Consultation processIn order to broaden the supervisory discussion on EIMs conducted among the EU competent authorities, the EBA also invites views from external stakeholders.

The publication of the two ITS is a major step forward towards promoting market discipline through enhanced and comparable public disclosures for stakeholders, and towards keeping the reporting requirements in line with the evolving needs for Supervisory Authorities' risk assessments.CRR2 implements a number of key measures such as net stable funding ratio, leverage ratio and large exposures and introduces new disclosure requirements for institutions on all prudential topics. These comprehensive disclosure and reporting ITS are released in the context of the EBA Roadmaps on the Risk Reduction Package on disclosures and on supervisory reporting.The disclosure ITS optimise the Pillar 3 policy framework for credit institutions by providing a single overarching package that brings together all previous pieces of regulation and incorporates all prudential disclosures, thus facilitating implementation by institutions and improving clarity for users of such information. The ITS implement the disclosures in a way to ensure that market participants have sufficient and comparable information to assess the risk profiles of institutions, in line with the Basel Committee\u2019s Pillar 3 standards and with the increased standardisation of institutions' public disclosures. This reinforces the ultimate objective of market discipline. The CRR2 definitions for \u2018small and less complex institutions\u2019 and \u2018large institutions\u2019 support proportionality of Pillar 3 disclosures. In addition, the ITS include thresholds to trigger additional disclosures for large banks based on their risk profiles.The reporting ITS reflect the changes brought in by the CRR2 and the Prudential Backstop Regulation and include new reporting requirements on counterparty credit risk and net stable funding ratio, non-performing exposures minimum coverage and changes to different areas of reporting, including own funds, credit risk, large exposures, leverage ratio, FINREP and G-SII indicators.These ITS include several proportionality measures, including simplified net stable funding ratio reporting for small and non-complex institutions. These ITS are designed to replace the Commission's Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and they have been used as an opportunity to improve the consistency between the reporting and disclosure requirements, with a view to facilitate institutions' compliance with both requirements.Implementation and remittance dateThe first disclosure and reporting reference dates will be 30 June 2021.Legal basis and next stepsThe ITS on disclosure have been developed in accordance with the mandate included in Article 434a of Regulation (EU) N0 575/2013.The ITS on supervisory reporting have been developed in accordance with the mandate included in Article 430 of Regulation (EU) N0 575/2013.

With EU economies not yet fully opened, this extension shows the importance of a continued support to the measures taken by banks to extend loans in response to the extraordinary nature of the current situation. This extension would ensure that adequate treatment for borrowers is available across the EU, considering that the Covid-19 crisis has been affecting EU countries in a different way and at a different pace.Acknowledging the crucial role played by banks in providing financing to European businesses and citizens during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the EBA has decided to legally extend the application date of the Guidelines by three months. In granting this extension, the EBA is highly aware of the trade-off faced in making the extension, as persistent liquidity shortages under the current circumstances may develop into solvency issues that need to be properly assessed by banks on a case-by-case basis. .In addition, the EBA highlights that the implementation timeline envisaged in the EBA\u2019s IRB roadmap to repair internal models remains overall unchanged. The EBA, nonetheless, also recognises that there may be institution-specific circumstances requiring more flexibility. Consequently, the EBA notes that supervisors may want to use their supervisory discretion in line with Article 146 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has raised a significant number of policy challenges, both at the EU and national level. One of the main decisive EBA actions to apply the flexibility embedded in the regulatory framework, was the publication of the Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria on loan repayments (EBA/GL/2020/02, GLs on moratoria) on the 2 April 2020.

The objective of these RTS is to define and harmonise the criteria for the identification of such staff and to ensure a consistent approach across the EU. The identification process is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative criteria.\u201cRisk takers\u201d will be identified based on the criteria laid down in the revised Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and those specified in the RTS, once the final draft have been adopted. To ensure that all risk takers are identified, members of staff are identified as having a material impact on the institution\u2019s risk profile as soon as they meet at least one of the criteria, be it the criteria foreseen under the CRD, the qualitative or quantitative criteria in the RTS or, where necessary because of the specificities of their business model, additional internal criteria.Following the feedback received during the consultation phase, the qualitative criteria have been revisited to enhance the application of proportionality. The definition of managerial responsibility has been revised taking into account that institutions of different sizes have different layers of hierarchical levels. The final draft RTS also clarify how the criteria should be applied on a consolidated, sub-consolidated and individual basis. Finally, some flexibility in calculating the amount of remuneration for the application of the quantitative requirements has been introduced.In terms of quantitative criteria, the revised CRD set out a threshold of total remuneration of EUR 500\u00a0000 combined with the average of the remuneration of members of the management body and senior management. The final draft RTS retain the qualitative criterion that identify the staff high levels of remuneration above EUR 750 000. In addition, the 0.3% of staff with the highest remuneration criterion has been amended to be applied only by institutions that have more than 1\u00a0000 staff in order to reduce the burden for small institutions.

The purpose of the peer review was to assess the resilience of DGSs based on the results of the DGS stress tests, and to identify good practices and areas for improvement.In the Report, the EBA assessed the results of 135 DGS stress tests performed by 32 DGSs from 27 EU Member States. The priority tests covered DGS\u2019 operational and funding capabilities, credit institutions\u2019 single customer view (SCV) files containing depositor information to prepare for a DGS payout, and cross-border cooperation between DGSs in case of cross-border branches.The EBA concluded that such tests have become an established tool to prepare for DGS interventions. In addition, the EBA is of the view that using the grading system outlined in the Guidelines on stress tests of DGSs, the overall resilience of DGSs across the EU is \u2018fair\u2019, which is the second best result, after \u2018optimal\u2019. This means that the identified shortcomings are isolated and/or can easily be addressed by the DGSs at the point of failure, and are unlikely to affect the ability of DGSs to perform their tasks in line with the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD). The Report also identified good practices that were deployed by a number of DGSs and which can be considered by the other DGSs.The EBA also highlighted some shortcomings and provided early indications on how to improve and enhance the framework. In particular, the EBA found that the divergence in the type of exercises performed and in the way outcomes were reported, made it difficult for the EBA to compare the tests between DGSs, thus hampering the desired consistency. The EBA, therefore, provided early indications on how to enhance the comparability for future peer reviews. These early indications will also serve as input for any potential future revision of the EBA Guidelines on stress tests of DGSs.While the peer review performed by the EBA is a regular exercise required by the DGSD, it also includes provisions stemming from the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, the Report outlines lessons learnt from a real-life payout case in one EU Member State that coincided with the pandemic. The Report also includes early indications of how to improve the framework by exploring how to incentivise DGSs to perform \u2018special\u2019 tests, which would allow them to assess scenarios with severe business continuity problems, such as a pandemic, power outages or significant operational disruptions.Legal basisThe DGSD requires Member States to ensure that DGSs perform stress tests of their systems. In 2016, the EBA issued Guidelines on stress tests of DGSs that set out the scope, principle-based requirements and a list of four \u2018priority tests\u2019 that DGSs are required to perform and report on to the EBA by 3 July 2019, by means of a predefined reporting template. The DGSD, in turn, requires the EBA to use these reports to conduct a peer review of all DGSs across the EU, and to do so at least every five years.

The EBA carried out its annual EU wide transparency exercise, which confirmed the stronger capital position of European banks and the steady decline in non-performing loans (NPLs). Another fundamental achievement in the transparency domain was the finalisation of EUCLID and the strengthening of the EBA\u2019s role as an EU data hub for Competent Authorities.Throughout 2019, the EBA continued its work to protect consumers and depositors and contributed to secure and convenient retail payments in the EU.Financial innovation and digital finance were also at the core of the EBA\u2019s activities.

The consultation runs until 09 July 2020.As part of the Risk Reduction Measures (RRM) package adopted by the European legislators, the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) has been amended and introduced, among other things, \u00a0an exemption from the deduction of intangible assets from Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) items for prudently valued software assets, the value of which is not negatively affected by resolution, insolvency or liquidation of the institution. In addition, the EBA has been mandated to develop draft RTS to specify how this provision shall be applied.These draft RTS specify the methodology to be adopted by institutions for the purpose of the prudential treatment of software assets. In particular, these draft RTS introduce a prudential treatment based on their amortisation, which is deemed to strike an appropriate balance between the need to maintain a certain margin of conservatism in the treatment of software assets as intangibles, and their relevance from a business and an economic perspective. The proposed approach is expected to be easy to implement and applicable to all institutions in a standardised manner. \u00a0The EBA will closely monitor the evolution of the investments in software assets going forward, including the link between the proposed prudential treatment and the need for EU institutions to make some necessary investments in IT developments in areas like cyber risk or digitalisation.Consultation processComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

This additional data disclosure comes as a response to the outbreak of COVID-19 and provides market participants with bank-level data as of 31 December 2019, prior to the start of the crisis. The data confirms the EU banking sector entered the crisis with solid capital positions and improved asset quality, but also shows the significant dispersion across banks. \u00a0CET1 ratio\u00a0NPL ratioLeverage ratio(transitional) (fully loaded) (fully phased-in)25th pct13.9%13.4%1.2%4.9%Weighted average15.1%14.8%2.7%5.5%75th pct18.5%18.4%4.3%8.4%Commenting on the publication of the results, Jose Manuel Campa, EBA Chairperson, said: \u201cThe EBA considers that the provision to market participants of continuous information on banks\u2019 exposures and asset quality is crucial, particularly in moments of increased uncertainty. The dissemination of banks\u2019 data complements our ongoing monitoring of the risks and vulnerabilities in the banking sector and contributes to preserving financial stability in the Single Market\u201d.In the context of an unprecedented health crisis, EU-wide Transparency data confirms banks entered this challenging period in a stronger position than in previous crises in line with the EBA\u2019s \u201cThematic note on the first insights into the Covid-19 impacts\u201d. Compared with the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009, banks now hold larger capital and liquidity buffers.EU banks reported increasing capital ratios in 2019. The EU weighted average CET1 fully loaded capital ratio was at 14.8% as of Q4 2019, around 40bps higher than Q3 2019. The trend was supported by higher capital, but also contracting risk exposure amounts (REA). As of December 2019, 75% of the banks reported a CET1 fully loaded capital ratio above 13.4% and all banks reported a ratio above 11%, well above the regulatory requirements. Compared to the previous quarter, the interquartile range remained stable.The EU weighted fully phased-in leverage ratio stood at 5.5% as of December 2019. The leverage ratio increased by 30bps compared to the previous quarter, driven by rising capital and declining exposures. The lowest reported leverage ratio was 4.7% at country level, and 1.6% at bank level.The asset quality of EU banks has been on an improving trend over the last few years. As of Q4 2019 the EU weighted average NPL ratio declined to 2.7%, 20bps lower than in Q3 2019. The Q4 2019 ratio was the lowest since the EBA introduced a harmonised definition of NPLs across European countries. Dispersion in the NPL ratio across countries remained wide, with few banks still reporting double-digit ratios, although in the last quarter the interquartile range compressed by 80 bps, to 3.1%.Notes to the editorsThe EBA postponed the EU-wide stress test exercise to 2021 to allow banks to focus on and ensure continuity of their core operations, including support for their customers.The EBA has been conducting transparency exercises at EU-wide level on an annual basis since 2011. The transparency exercise is part of the EBA\u2019s ongoing efforts to foster transparency and market discipline in the EU financial market, and complements banks\u2019 own Pillar 3 disclosures, as laid down in the EU\u2019s capital requirements directive (CRD). Unlike stress tests, transparency exercises are purely disclosure exercises where only bank-by-bank data are published and no shocks are applied to the actual data.The spring 2020 transparency exercise covers 127 banks from 27 EEA countries, and data is disclosed at the highest level of consolidation as of September 2019 and December 2019. The transparency exercise fully relies on supervisory reporting data.Along with the dataset, the EBA also provides a document highlighting the key statistics derived from the dataset, and a wide range of interactive tools that allow users to compare and visualise data by using maps at a country and a bank-by-bank level.

The EBA will deliver on its IFR/IFD mandates following a four-phased approach running from 2020 to 2025. The European Banking Authority (EBA) outlined today its roadmap for the implementation of the new regulatory framework for investment firms and launched a public consultation on its first set of regulatory deliverables on prudential, reporting, disclosures and remuneration requirements. The roadmap outlines the EBA\u2019s work plan for each of the mandates laid down in the IFR/IFD and clarifies the sequencing and rationale behind their prioritisation. Through these mandates, the EBA will contribute to the implementation of a regulatory framework that is calibrated to the size and nature of investment firms. This will strengthen supervision, which will rely more directly on the risks faced by the clients and the investment firms themselves. The consultations launched today run until 4 September\u00a02020. The first consultation paper on prudential requirements includes three draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the reclassification of certain investment firms to credit institutions, five draft RTS on capital requirements for investment firms at solo level, and one draft RTS on the scope and methods of prudential consolidation for investment firms at group level. The second consultation paper on reporting requirements and disclosures, includes draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on the levels of capital, concentration risk, liquidity, the level of activities as well as disclosure of own funds; and draft RTS specifying the information that investment firms have to provide in order to enable the monitoring of the thresholds that determine whether an investment firm has to apply for authorisation as credit institution. The third and fourth consultation papers on remuneration requirements include one draft RTS on the criteria to identify all categories of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the firm\u2019s risk profile or assets it manages (\u2018risk takers\u2019); and one draft RTS specifying the classes of instruments that adequately reflect the credit quality of the investment firm as a going concern and possible alternative arrangements that are appropriate to be used for the purposes of variable remuneration of risk takers. When developing these RTS and ITS, the EBA has considered the proportionality principle so as to take into account the specificities of the different classes of investment firms. Finally, to assess the impact of the provisions proposed in the regulatory deliverables, the EBA also launched a data collection exercise on a voluntary basis.

The Opinion aims to support the objectives of the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) of enabling customers to use new and innovative payment services offered by TPPs by addressing a number of issues regarding the interfaces provided by account servicing payment service providers (ASPSPs) to TPPs.Today\u2019s Opinion clarifies when mandatory redirection is an obstacle to the provision of TPPs\u2019 services and the authentication procedures that ASPSPs\u2019 interfaces are required to support. The Opinion also provides clarifications on a number of obstacles identified in the market, including requiring multiple SCAs, the manual entry of the IBAN in the ASPSPs\u2019 domain, or imposing additional checks of the consent given by the customer to the TPP. The Opinion also explains that requiring re-authentication every 90 days for account information services in accordance with the RTS on SCA&CSC is not an obstacle.With this Opinion, EBA expects that Competent Authorities (CAs) take the necessary actions to ensure compliance of the interfaces offered by ASPSPs with the PSD2 and the RTS and, where obstacles are identified, to ensure that ASPSPs remove them within the shortest possible time. The EBA will monitor the way in which the clarifications provided in this Opinion are taken into account. Where the EBA identifies inconsistencies, despite the clarifications provided in this Opinion, it will take the actions needed to remedy them.Background and legal basisPSD2 entered into force on 13 January 2016 and applies since 13 January 2018. The Directive enables payment service users to use account information services and payment initiation services offered by TPPs, and requires ASPSPs to establish the access interfaces through which TPPs can access the customers\u2019 payment accounts in a secure manner.Article 32(3) of RTS on SCA &CSC requires ASPSPs that have implemented a dedicated interface to ensure that the interface does not create obstacles to the provision of payment initiation and account information services. With today\u2019s Opinion, the EBA responds to requests for clarification as to whether certain market practices constitute such obstacles.The EBA issued the Opinion in accordance with Article 29(1)(a) of its Founding Regulation, which mandates the Authority to play an active role in building a common Union supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices, as well as in ensuring uniform procedures and consistent approaches throughout the Union.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-opinion-obstacles-provision-third-party-provider-services-under-payment-services"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0268", "date": "2020-06-02", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA issues Guidelines to address gaps in reporting data and public information in the context of COVID-19", "text": " The Guidelines address, in a proportionate way, data gaps in supervisory reporting and disclosure associated with the measures to deal with the COVID-19 crisis. The Guidelines are needed to ensure that the minimum necessary information is available to monitor and assess risks associated with institutions\u2019 activities, and to strengthen transparency and market discipline.By design, in the application of these guidelines, proportionality and supervisory flexibility play a key role.The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its Guidelines on reporting and disclosure of exposures subject to measures applied in response to the COVID-19 crisis. These Guidelines follow the implementation of a broad range of measures, such as legislative moratoria on loan repayments and public guarantees in Member States, with the aim to support the operational and liquidity challenges faced by borrowers. The Guidelines have been developed to address data gaps associated with such measures to ensure an appropriate understanding of institutions\u2019 risk profile and the asset quality on their balance sheets both for supervisors and the wider public.Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis, national governments and EU bodies have taken measures to address and mitigate the adverse systemic economic impact of the pandemic on the EU banking sector. In particular, the EBA is engaged in an effort to provide clarity to institutions on the application of prudential and supervisory measures to support lending into the real economy.In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the measures introduced by authorities in the EU banking sector have created some data gaps in supervisory reporting and disclosure. Whilst the measures are designed to ensure support for EU citizens and business during the crisis, regulators and supervisory authorities still have a responsibility to ensure that information is available to monitor and understand any risks associated with banks\u2019 activities.\u00a0These Guidelines cover information that is crucial for understanding the prudential soundness of individual institutions, without impacting their treatment of creditors under moratoria or public guarantees. The information requested here reflects the type of information that senior managements in institutions are asking for, and is key for understanding the overall financial stability in the EU.To ensure efficiency, a coordinated EU approach in the collection of additional information is needed. That is why the EBA is introducing, on a temporary basis, additional reporting for the application of the payment moratoria, forbearance measures applied in response to COVID-19 to the existing loans and public guarantees to new lending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the development of these reporting and disclosure templates, the EBA was particularly mindful of the need for proportionality that can take account of the size and complexity of the institutions, as well as of the specificities of the measures introduced in Member States, and institutions\u2019 operational efficiency in current circumstances.These additional reporting and disclosure requirements are expected to be time-limited as they are introduced strictly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Implementation and remittance dateThe first reporting reference date and the disclosure reference date will be 30 June 2020. The reporting guidelines will be part of the version 2.10 reporting framework release that will be published in June 2020.Legal basisThese Guidelines have been drafted in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (EBA Founding Regulation), which mandates the Authority to issue guidelines addressed to all competent authorities or all financial institutions and issue recommendations to one or more competent authorities or to one or more financial institutions, with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the ESFS, and to ensuring the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law.

The Guidelines also aim to ensure that the institutions\u2019 practices are aligned with consumer protection rules and respect fair treatment of consumers.\u201cFor the first time in the EBA\u2019s regulatory practice, these Guidelines bring together the prudential and consumer protection perspectives, which lies at the heart of sound and sustainable lending to consumers, SMEs and corporates. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic institutions need to maintain good credit risk management and monitoring standards that is essential for supporting lending to the economy. To address the current circumstances the new Guidelines contain additional transition periods for recently renegotiated loans to help institutions better focusing on their immediate operational priorities\u201d, said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Campa, the EBA Chairperson.The Guidelines specify internal governance arrangements for the granting and monitoring of credit facilities throughout their lifecycle. In particular, the Guidelines clarify the credit decision-making processincluding the use of automated models, building on the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance.The Guidelines set requirements for assessing the borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness together with the handling of information and data for the purposes of such assessments. In these requirements, the Guidelines bring together the EBA\u2019s prudential and consumer protection objectives.The EBA has developed these Guidelines building on the existing national experiences, addressing shortcomings in institutions\u2019 credit granting policies and practices highlighted by past experiences. At the same time, these Guidelines reflect recent supervisory priorities and policy developments related to credit granting, including environmental, social and governance factors, anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing, and technology-based innovation.Application date and implementation periodThe Guidelines will apply from 30 June 2021. However, institutions will benefit from a series of transitional arrangements: (1) the application of the guidelines to the already existing loans and advances that require renegotiation or contractual changes with the borrowers will apply from 30 June 2022, and (2) institutions will be allowed to address possible data gaps and adjust their monitoring frameworks and infrastructure until 30 June 2024. Notwithstanding the extended transition period, the EBA notes that all loan origination requires effective risk oversight and management.The EBA also calls on competent authorities to exercise their judgement and be pragmatic and proportionate in monitoring the implementation of the Guidelines, taking into account the operational challenges and priorities institutions may have due to the COVID-19 pandemic, whilst facilitating the economic recovery efforts.Legal basis and backgroundThe EBA developed the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring in accordance with the Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 in response to the European Council Action Plan on tackling the high level of non-performing loans. The European Council, in its July 2017 Action Plan, invited the EBA to \u201cissue detailed guidelines on banks\u2019 loan origination, monitoring and internal governance which could in particular address issues such as transparency and borrower affordability assessment\u201d.These Guidelines specify the internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms, as laid down in Article 74(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, requirements on credit and counterparty risk, as laid down in Article 79 of that directive, and requirements in relation to the creditworthiness assessment of the consumer, as laid down in Chapter 6 of Directive 2014/17/EU and Article 8 of Directive 2008/48/EC.The Guidelines will replace the existing EBA Guidelines on creditworthiness assessments under the MCD (EBA/GL/2015/11), which the EBA issued in June 2015, and which will be repealed with the effect from the date of application on the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.

Overall, the Report finds that the key topics for supervisory attention identified in the EBA 2019 convergence plan have been largely implemented in supervisory work across the EU. The Report is part of the EBA\u2019s work to actively foster and promote supervisory convergence across the Union in order to bring about strong supervisory standards and a common supervisory culture.One of the core elements covered in this Report is the practical application of the Single Rulebook by competent authorities (CAs) in their supervisory activities. The Report also provides an update on the policy developments and training activities supporting supervisory convergence. For the first time, the Report incorporates information on convergence in supervisory colleges that used to be included in a separate report in the past.The Report finds that the four key topics for supervisory attention identified in the EBA 2019 \u00a0convergence plan \u2013 internal governance, ICT risk and operational resilience, non-performing exposures, and benchmarking of internal models - \u00a0have been largely implemented in supervisory work across the EU, although to different degrees. Areas that will require further attention include the formalisation of the ICT risk appetite and how it cascades down the organisation ICT risk governance and controls and\u00a0 the ongoing assessment of the individual and collective suitability of the members of the management bodies.Supervisory colleges made considerable efforts in 2019 to conduct thorough group risk assessments, and the areas that received the most supervisory attention correspond to the key topics that the EBA put forward in its 2019 convergence plan.The Report incorporates the 2020 convergence plan. The plan has identified five key topics for supervisory attention for 2020: ICT risk and operational resilience, loan origination standards, profitability, capital and liability management and money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risk and other conduct risk for prudential supervisors. These topics for supervisory attention for 2020 have become even more relevant in the context of this COVID-19 crisis. The plan makes reference to the significant supervisory efforts and resources that will be dedicated to monitoring the crisis preparedness of institutions in 2020 and further implications of COVID-19 on credit institutions` operations and financial soundness.\u00a0Note to the editorsArticle 107 of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) mandates the EBA to annually report to the European Parliament and the Council on the degree of convergence of the application of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) and supervisory measures.The EBA has a number of tools at its disposal to deliver on this mandate and to effectively promote supervisory convergence across the Union. The three main convergence tools of the EBA are i) the development of regulatory and policy products; ii) training and iii) monitoring and assessment.

The measure intends to tighten, for French global or other systemically important institutions, the large-exposure limits applicable to large and highly indebted non-financial corporations (NFCs) resident in France or groups of connected NFCs assessed to be highly indebted and based in France. Based on the evidence submitted, the EBA does not object to the extension of the proposed measure, which will be applied from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021.In particular, with the application of this measure, French systemically important institutions will not incur an exposure exceeding 5% of their eligible capital for NFCs or for groups of connected NFCs assessed to be highly indebted. The 5% limit will act as a backstop to safeguard these institutions from excessive risk-taking and prevent the build-up of future vulnerabilities.In its Opinion, addressed to the Council, the European Commission and the French Authorities, the EBA acknowledges that the objective of limiting indebtedness levels of large and already indebted French NFCs is appropriate with a view to promoting financial stability and preventing future systemic shocks to the French and EU economies. The EBA also encourages the French authorities to monitor closely the developments during the COVID-19 pandemic and to be ready to de-activate the measure promptly if it leads to unintended consequences.In light of this conclusion, the EBA does not object to the extended deployment, by the HCSF, of the proposed macroprudential measures, which will be applied from 1 July 2020 to 31 June 2021.BackgroundAlready in its Opinion issued on 13 March 2018, the EBA did not object to the adoption of this measure, taking into consideration the measure\u2019s objectives of resilience (limiting concentration risks) and prevention (intensifying the vigilance about high leverage of NFCs).\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-issues-opinion-measures-address-macroprudential-risk-following-notification-french-high-council"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0274", "date": "2020-05-25", "text_type": "PR", "title": "COVID-19 is placing unprecedented challenges on EU banks", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a preliminary assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on the EU banking sector. With the global economy facing unprecedented challenges, banks entered the health crisis with strong capital and liquidity buffers and managed the pressure on operational capacities activating their contingency plans. The crisis is expected to affect asset quality and, thus, profitability of banks going forward. Nonetheless, the capital accumulated by banks during the past years along with the capital relief provided by regulators amounts on average to 5p.p. above their overall capital requirements (OCR). This capital buffer should allow banks to withstand the potential credit risk losses derived from a sensitivity analysis based on the 2018 stress test.Banks have entered the COVID-19 crisis more capitalised and with better liquidity compared to previous crises. In contrast to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008-2009, banks now hold larger capital and liquidity buffers. The common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio rose from 9% in 2009 to nearly 15% as of Q4 2019, including a management buffer above overall capital requirements and Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G) of on average about 3% of risk weighted assets (RWAs). In addition to the ample management buffers, the capital related measures put in place by EU regulators to mitigate the effects of the crisis will free up roughly 2% of RWAs. Similarly, prior to the pandemic outbreak, banks\u2019 liquidity coverage ratios (LCR) were on average close to 150%, significantly above the regulatory minimum.The COVID-19 crisis will have a negative impact on asset quality. As the crisis develops, banks are likely to face growing non-performing loan (NPL) volumes, which can reach levels similar to those recorded in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis. A sensitivity analysis based on the 2018 EBA stress test suggests credit risk losses could amount up to 3.8% of RWAs. Hence, the banking sector would on average count on enough capital to cover potential losses under the most severe credit risk shock while maintaining a buffer equivalent to 1.1p.p. of RWAs above their OCR. State-guarantees introduced in many jurisdictions might soften this impact while the EBA Guidelines on loan moratoria will avoid the automatic classification of affected exposures as forborne or defaulted. Nonetheless, banks should assure that proper risk assessment continues to be performed. The extent to which banks will be affected by the crisis is expected to differ widely, depending on how the crisis evolves, the starting capital level of each bank and the magnitude of their exposures to the most affected sectors. Competent authorities should address quickly any idiosyncratic weaknesses that could be exacerbated by the current crisis.Banks have been using their liquidity buffers and are expected to continue using them in the coming months. Since February 2020, funding market conditions have significantly deteriorated, with spreads widening substantially and new unsecured debt issuances almost coming to a halt until mid-April. Under these circumstances, banks have increased significantly their reliance on central bank funding. Banks are also expected to make some use of their ample liquidity buffers in the months to come.Banks\u2019 operational resilience is under pressure. Following the outbreak of the pandemic, banks have activated their contingency plans, which have allowed them to keep their core functions broadly unaffected. However, the handling of large volumes of applications for debt moratoria and guaranteed loans, and the insufficient preparation of some offshore units to work remotely added some pressure on their operational capacities.Note to the editorsGiven the uncertainty of the impact of the crisis on the economy and some of the assumptions made, the estimates in the published note are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution. The analysis of the note looks at the banking sector as a whole and is not intended to provide any bank-by-bank or country assessment.In early June, the EBA will publish the results of its additional Transparency Exercise, and provide detailed bank-by-bank data.

These RTS support the effective application of temporary restrictions on early termination rights (resolution stays) in relation to financial contracts governed by the law of a third country. These standards are the first EBA mandate stemming from the revised BRRD and aim at promoting the effective application of recovery and resolution powers to banks and banking groups and to foster convergence of practices between relevant authorities and institutions across the EU. The consultation runs until 15 August 2020.The BRRD requires Member States to ensure that their resolution authorities can effectively make use of the stay powers on contracts that an institution or entity has entered into, in case resolution powers or crisis prevention measures are applied.These draft RTS specify the contents of the contractual term required to be included in relevant financial contracts where no alternative mechanism (i.e. statutory) exists to secure the recognition by the counterparty of the resolution authority\u2019s powers to suspend or restrict rights and obligations.

The resulting Report sets out the EBA\u2019s expectations of credit institutions and national authorities under the current regulatory framework. The EBA also decided on a 10-point action plan for 2020/21 to enhance the future framework of prudential and anti-money laundering requirements covering such schemes.The Report sets out the EBA\u2019s expectations under the current regulatory framework include requiring them to take a comprehensive view of the risks highlighted by dividend arbitrage trading cases looking at the adequacy of financial institutions\u2019 internal controls and internal governance arrangements, their systems and controls of anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT). The expectations also cover the exchange of information between prudential and AML authorities when performing reviews of institutions\u2019 internal controls and governance; AML authorities reaching out to local tax authorities; prudential and AML authorities pursuing targeted inspections; and prudential supervisory colleges discussing such schemes.To enhance the future regulatory framework, the EBA also published a 10-point action plan, which seizes on the opportunities afforded by recent legislative changes in the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRDV) and the EBA\u2019s AML/CFT mandate in the EBA Regulation, and which will be implemented in 2020 and 2021. The EBA will strengthen its prudential Guidelines on Internal Governance, its Guidelines on the Assessment of the Suitability of Members of the Management Body and Key Function Holders, and its Guidelines on Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), and it will also monitor how prudential colleges will follow up on Cum-Ex related guidance.With regard to AML requirements, the EBA will amend its Guidelines on money laundering and terrorist financing (TF) risk factors, its Guidelines on Risk-Based AML/CFT Supervision, and its biennial Opinion on ML/TF Risks. The EBA will also allocate explicit time to such schemes during its staff-led AML/CFT implementation reviews of national authorities, and monitor AML/CFT colleges for financial institutions that are exposed to significant ML/TF risks associated with tax crimes.The EBA will then carry out a second formal inquiry into the actions taken by financial institutions and national authorities to supervise compliance with the aforementioned amended requirements.Legal BasisThe EBA has a legal duty to contribute to preventing the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) and to lead, coordinate and monitor the AML/CFT efforts of all EU AML/CFT super and financial institutions across all sectors. The law implementing these powers and this mandate came into effect on 1 January 2020.On 28 November 2018, the European Parliament asked the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) to \u201cconduct an inquiry into dividend arbitrage trading schemes such as cum-ex or cum-cum in order to assess potential threats to the integrity of financial markets and to national budgets; to establish the nature and magnitude of actors in these schemes; to assess whether there were breaches of either national or Union law; to assess the actions taken by financial supervisors in Member States; and to make appropriate recommendations for reform and for action to the competent authorities concerned\u201d.

The EBA publishes this data on a yearly basis to enhance the transparency and public accountability of deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) across the EU to the benefit of depositors, markets, policymakers, DGSs and Members States.Available financial means is the amount of funds raised by DGSs from credit institutions to be used mainly to reimburse depositors in case of bank failures. The data as of 31 December 2019 shows that 28 out of a total of 37 DGSs in EU Member States had increased their funds since 31 December 2018. In general, the increase stems from levies paid by the members of those DGSs, which were raised in order to reach the target level of 0.8% of covered deposits set out in the DGSD and to be attained by July 2024.\u00a0No significant changes to the available financial means occurred in six DGSs, including three cases where the DGSs already hold more than the minimum target level of 0.8% of covered deposits. The amount of available financial means decreased only for two DGSs: in Latvia because of a significant payout to depositors in 2019, and in Norway where half of the DGS available financial means were transferred to a separate resolution fund. Finally, there is also one new DGS in Austria, which took over the protection of deposits previously provided by four separate schemes.The data also shows that the target level of 0.8% of covered deposits, to be attained by July 2024, had been achieved by 18 of the 37 DGSs in the EU.Legal basisThe EBA is collecting this data in accordance with Art. 10(10) of the DGSD.On 25 October 2016, the EBA decided to make this data publicly available on its website.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-updates-data-deposit-guarantee-schemes-across-eu"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0280", "date": "2020-05-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA launches updated college collaboration platform", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched an updated version of its online collaboration platform enabling the joint work and sharing of information between authorities involved in supervision and resolution of cross-border banking groups.

These Guidelines complement the EBA Report on CRM, which focuses on the standardised approach (SA) and the foundation-IRB approach (F-IRB).\u00a0The Guidelines clarify the application of the CRM provisions currently laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) applicable to institutions using the A-IRB Approach. In particular, they clarify the eligibility requirements for different CRM techniques, namely funded and unfunded credit protection (e.g. collateral and guarantees), available to institutions.For funded credit protection, the Guidelines provide a mapping to the eligibility requirements of legal certainty and collateral valuation applicable to institutions using the standardised approach (SA) and the foundation internal ratings-based (F-IRB) approach. Specific guidance is also provided on other than immovable physical collateral for which the assessment of legal certainty is particularly challenging.\u00a0The Guidelines also clarify how institutions may recognise the effects of different CRM techniques for capital requirement purposes.

The updated ITS include all benchmarking portfolios that will be used for the 2021 exercise. The main novelty is the inclusion of the IFRS9 template. The benchmarking exercise is an essential supervisory tool to enhance the quality of internal models, which is particularly important in a stressed economic situation.In order to analyse potential sources of variability stemming from the implementation of the new accounting standard (IFRS 9), two annexes have been introduced. The collection of quantitative data on the IFRS 9 parameters will contribute to gather a better understanding of the different methodologies, models, inputs and scenarios, which could lead to material inconsistencies in expected credit loss (ECL) outcomes, and affect own funds and regulatory ratios. The initial focus of the analysis is on the probability of default (PD) parameter, and, in particular, on the following three aspects:The analysis of the variability of the PD parameter estimated over a default horizon of 12 months;Variability of the macroeconomic forecasts and the interaction between the lifetime PD curve and the macro economic scenarios used for determining the ECL;Variability of practices in the assessment of significant increases in credit risk (SICR).\u00a0On the credit risk side, neither new portfolios nor new data points have been added compared to the 2020 exercise. However, some marginal changes have been applied in annex I. First, the annex now includes counterparties treated under the standardised approach, which are reported in the IFRS 9 template.

These Guidelines \u00a0aim at ensuring that the methodology applicable for the determination of the WAM for regulatory purposes is sufficiently transparent and harmonised in order to increase consistency and comparability in the own funds held by institutions.The maturity of the tranche is an additional parameter introduced by the revised Securitisation Regulation that is needed by institutions using the internal or the external rating based approach (SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA) for the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amounts of their securitisation positions. These Guidelines will help institutions using SEC-IRBA or the SEC-ERBA and opting for the use of the weighted average maturity approach (WAM) instead of the final legal maturity approach when calculating their capital requirements.Infinalising the Guidelines, the EBA considered that the methodology applicable for the determination of the WAM for regulatory purposes should be sufficiently harmonised, to allow even less sophisticated institutions to use it, conservative to maintain a sufficient level of prudence, and simple to facilitate the supervision by competent authorities.The main areas covered by the guidelines are the following:Meaning of contractual payments due under the tranche;Data and information requirements;Methodologies for determining the contractual payments of the securitised exposures due under the tranche both for traditional and synthetic securitisations;Implementation and use of the WAM model.Legal basisThe GLs have been developed according to Article 257(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by Regulation (EU) 2401/2017.

In this context, these amending draft RTS were developed to facilitate further an internationally coordinated approach on how to adapt the implementation of the bilateral margin requirements.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) announced on 3 April1\u00a0their agreement to defer by one year, the deadline for completing the final two implementation phases of the bilateral margin requirements, in order to provide additional operational capacity for counterparties to respond to the immediate impact of COVID-19. The ESAs draft RTS present the changes to the Delegated Regulation on bilateral margining to incorporate in the EU regulatory framework the one-year deferral agreed by the BCBS and IOSCO.\u00a0These changes would result in covered counterparties with an aggregate average notional amount of non-centrally cleared derivatives above \u20ac50 billion becoming subject to the requirement to exchange initial margin from 1 September 2021, while covered counterparties with an aggregate average notional amount of non-centrally cleared derivatives above \u20ac8 billion becoming subject to the requirement from 1 September 2022.Legal basis and next stepsThe ESAs have developed the RTS under Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR).A first version (ESAs 2019 20) of these draft RTS had been submitted to the Commission and published on the websites of the ESAs on 5 December 2019. This first version dealt with the treatment of physically settled FX forward and swap contracts, intragroup contracts, equity option contracts and the implementation of the initial margin requirements. However, in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the Final Report and the draft RTS have now been updated to take into account the agreement from the BCBS and IOSCO to defer by one year the deadline for completing the final two implementation phases of the bilateral margin requirements. This updated version of the Final Report on the draft RTS on bilateral margining thus replaces entirely the version submitted to the Commission in December 2019.The ESAs have now submitted this second version of the draft RTS to the Commission for endorsement in the form of a Commission Delegated Regulation, i.e. a legally binding instrument applicable in all Member States of the European Union. Following the endorsement, they are then subject to non-objection by the European Parliament and the Council.Notes for editors1.

In particular, the EBA is proposing to introduce the use of a 66% aggregation factor to be applied until the 31 December 2020 under the so-called core approach. Furthermore, acknowledging the increased operational challenges faced by banks in the area of reporting, the EBA also intends to delay reporting for the first FRTB-SA figures to September 2021. Finally, the EBA highlights the flexibility in the prudential requirements available to competent authorities for banks using internal VaR models.The EBA also recognises the need for a pragmatic approach to SREP assessments in 2020, focusing on the most material risks and vulnerabilities driven by the crisis.\u00a0On recovery planning activities for institutions, the EBA believes the focus should be placed on understanding which recovery options are necessary and available under the current stressed conditions.The EBA emphasises the importance of digital operational resilience. In this respect, the EBA calls on institutions to ensure business continuity, adequate ICT capacity and security risk management. The new EBA ICT and security risk management Guidelines will guide financial institutions and supervisors to focus on priority areas.\u00a0Finally, the EBA provides further clarity on the prudential application of the definition of default and forbearance as well as how the EBA Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria on loan repayments apply to securitisations.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-provides-further-guidance-use-flexibility-relation-covid-19-and-calls-heightened-attention-risks"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0292", "date": "2020-04-20", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA updates its list of risk indicators, IMF-FSI mapping and respective guides", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today an updated guide on how to report the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) and a revised methodological guide on how to compile risk indicators and detailed risk analysis tools.

The EBA is of the view that the proposed changes, despite their substantive nature, do not alter the draft RTS in a significant manner, as they still maintain a good balance between the flexibility and risk sensitivity required for the IRB approach and the need for a harmonised regulatory framework.The EBA\u2019s Opinion identifies three substantive changes introduced by European Commission. The first two changes allow a certain flexibility in relation to the incorporation of risk drivers. In particular, the first change introduces the possibility for institutions to consider a sub-factor or a sub-factor component as irrelevant a certain type of specialised lending exposures. The second change allows institutions to consider additional relevant information (an \u2018additional risk driver\u2019) for a type of specialised lending exposures, jointly with the sub-factor which most closely corresponds to that additional risk driver. The EBA is of the view that the flexibilities introduced through these two substantive changes only marginally reduce the harmonisation across institutions since they should be applied consistently for the same type of exposure, and duly justified and documented.The third substantive change simplifies the rules on overlapping criteria at the level of the sub-factor or of the sub-factor components. The EBA is of the view that this change does not jeopardise significantly the risk sensitivity of the approach and has the merit of simplifying the RTS.Legal basis and backgroundThe EBA has delivered this Opinion in accordance with Article 10(1), subparagraph 6, of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, which requires the EBA to submit its response in the form of an opinion to amendments proposed by the European Commission.The EBA had submitted its final draft RTS to the European Commission on 13 June 2016.

Ahead of the Corona crisis, EU banks\u2019 capital ratios and asset quality have improved. However, return on equity (RoE) has further worsened.The CET1 ratio reached 14.8% on a fully loaded basis, up from 14.4% in Q3 2019. This trend was supported by higher capital, but also contracting risk exposure amounts (REA). The latter came in parallel to declines in total assets as well as total loans. Sound capital positions should enable EU banks to weather expected upcoming impacts stemming from the Coronavirus crisis and to provide lending to the economy at the time of need. The recent supervisory measures will also ensure that banks can efficiently deploy their capital buffers during the unfolding crisis. In addition, the suspension of dividends and variable remuneration aim at maintaining banks\u2019 sound capital base.The ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) further declined from 2.9% to 2.7% in Q4 2019, continuing a trend of small contractions similarly seen in the last three quarters. The NPL ratio contracted even though its denominator (total loans and advances) declined. Similar to the NPL ratio, IFRS 9-related figures showed an improvement in asset quality. The share of stage 2 assets declined from 6.9% to 6.8%, and the share of stage 3 assets from 3.3% to 3.1%. Looking forward, it is expected that asset quality will deteriorate in the quarters to come, even though extensive monetary and fiscal stimulus programmes as well as policy responses such as guidance on debt moratoria might provide some relief to banks and their customers.Banks' RoE declined by 80bps in Q4 to 5.8%, well below EU/EEA banks' average cost of equity. Banks' cost to income ratio increased from 63.3% in Q3 to 64% as of year-end 2019. Despite their slight widening from 1.43% to 1.45%, EU banks\u2019 net interest margin remained at a very low level. These trends, in addition to presumably strongly rising costs of risks and expectations of reduced fee income, will significantly increase the pressure on banks\u2019 profitability.Notes to editorsThe figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 147 banks, covering more than 80% of the EU banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates also include large subsidiaries (the list of banks can be found here). Stage 2 loans as referred to above are exposures for which the credit risk has increased significantly after their initial recognition, and Stage 3 loans are those, which are credit impaired. The Risk Dashboard\u2019s Q4 2019 data does not reflect the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Being based on June 2019 reporting date, these results do not reflect the economic impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on participating banks. Overall, the EBA estimates that the Basel III reforms, once fully implemented in 2028 after the additional delay of one year agreed by the Basel Committee, would determine an average increase by 16.1% of EU banks' Tier 1 minimum required capital.\u00a0 The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of EU banks, which was fully implemented in January 2018, stood at around 147% on average in June 2019.Basel III capital monitoring resultsThe Basel III monitoring Report assesses the impact on EU banks of the final revisions of credit risk, split into four sub-categories, operational risk, and leverage ratio frameworks, as well as of the introduction of the aggregate output floor. It also quantifies the impact of the new standards for market risk (FRTB) and credit valuation adjustments (CVA).\u00a0Overall, the results of the Basel III capital monitoring exercise, based on data as of 30 June 2019, show that European banks' minimum Tier 1 capital requirement would increase by 16.1% at the full implementation date (2028) and without taking into account EU-specific adjustments. The impact of the risk-based reforms is 20.2%, of which the leading factors are the output floor (6.5%) and operational risk (5%).\u00a0The fact that the leverage ratio is currently the constraining (i.e. the highest) Tier 1 requirement for some banks in the sample but would not be as constraining under the final Basel III, explains why part of the increase in the risk-based capital metric (-4.1%) is not to be accounted for as an actual increase in the overall Tier 1 requirement. This offsetting effect (-4.1%) is attributed to the leverage ratio contribution to the total impact.\u00a0\u00a0Change in total T1 MRC, as percentage of the overall current Tier 1 MRC, due to the full implementation of Basel III (2028) (weighted averages, in %)Bank groupCredit riskMarket risk[1]CVAOpRiskOutput floorOther Pillar\u00a01Total risk-basedRevised LRTotalSAIRBSecuritisationCCPsAll banks1.81.80.40.00.54.35.06.50.020.2\u20134.116.1Group\u00a011.51.50.40.00.64.65.56.80.020.8\u20133.517.3Of which: G-SIIs1.71.70.60.00.84.76.36.70.022.40.322.7Group\u00a024.03.90.00.00.42.31.44.10.015.9\u20137.78.1To comply with the new framework under the more realistic scenario, EU banks would need EUR 21.1 billion of additional Tier 1 capital. These estimates are based on the assumption that Basel III requirements are implemented in full, relying on data prior to the Covid-19 episode.EBA report on liquidity measuresThe semi-annual update of the EBA Report on liquidity measures, based on data prior to the Covid-19 epidemics, shows that EU banks have continued to improve their compliance with the LCR. At the reporting date of 30 June 2019, EU banks' average LCR was 147% and 78% of the banks in the sample had an LCR above 140%. The aggregate gross shortfall amounted to EUR 4.7 billion corresponding to three banks that had monetised their liquidity buffers during the financial crisis.Notes to the editorsThe cumulative impact analysis of the Basel III monitoring exercise report uses a total sample of 105 banks.The results of the Basel III capital monitoring report are presented separately for Group 1 and Group 2 banks. Group 1 banks are those with Tier 1 capital in excess of EUR 3 billion and are internationally active. All other banks are categorised as Group 2 banks.\u00a0The analysis of the Basel III capital monitoring report provides separate figures for the sample of global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs). Where applicable, the analysis takes account of G-SIIs capital buffer for the risk-based capital requirements and the leverage ratio requirements.The results of the report on liquidity measures are presented separately for G-SIIs and O-SIIs and other banks (non G-SIIs or O-SIIs). Some figures are presented by country.Article 412(1) of the CRR foresees the possibility of monetising liquid assets during times of stress (resulting in an LCR below 100%) as maintaining the LCR at 100%, under such circumstances, could produce undue negative effects on the credit institution and other market participants.\u00a0[1] \u00a0For two G-SIBs that are outliers owing to overly conservative assumptions under the revised market risk framework, zero change from the revised market risk framework has been assumed for the calculation of 30\u00a0June 2019 results showing \u2018reduced estimation bias\u2019.

This approach allows for the assessment of all financial institutions across the EU in a comparable way, whilst still not excluding those firms that may be deemed systemically important for one jurisdiction on the basis of certain specificities.\u00a0The list of O-SIIs is disclosed on an annual basis, along with any Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital buffer requirements, which may need to be set or reset. Higher capital requirements will become applicable once relevant authorities decide to set institution-specific buffer requirements as a consequence of this O-SII identification.The EBA acts as the single point of disclosure for the list of O-SIIs across the EU, while each relevant authority discloses information for its respective jurisdiction, along with further details on the underlying rationale and identification process.

The Report is based on the EBA financial education repository, which consists of more than 120 financial education initiatives taken by the national authorities. The FER describes the most common approaches used by the national authorities and the lessons learned and experiences gained in the area of financial education and financial literacy. It identifies, for example, that awareness-raising campaigns remain among the key tools used by national authorities to reach wide audiences and, in certain cases, to alert consumers to potential risks they may face regarding the use of financial products and services (e.g. crypto-assets).\u00a0Compared to the 2018 edition, this Report includes new aspects such as on the interplay between financial education and financial conduct regulation and supervision of the financial system. In addition, it highlights the increasing role of financial innovation and the growing focus on specific target groups for financial education and literacy initiatives, such as children, youth and elderly. It also identifies a number of developments that could influence future financial education initiatives, including behavioural economics, sustainable finance, and advanced analytics and big data.The Report provides an opportunity for national authorities to share and compare experiences, and for other organisations and individuals interested in financial education to learn about, and possibly build on, the work carried out so far in this area.Legal basisThe EBA has developed its Financial Education Reports in line with Article 9(1)(b) of the EBA's Founding Regulation, which requires the Authority \u201cto take a leading role in promoting transparency, simplicity and fairness in the market for consumer financial products or services across the internal market, including by reviewing and coordinating financial literacy and education initiatives by the competent authorities\u201d.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-identifies-trends-and-lessons-learned-financial-education-and-literacy-initiatives-its-second"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0304", "date": "2020-03-27", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes final draft standards on key areas for the EU implementation of the FRTB", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the new Internal Model Approach (IMA) under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB). These technical standards conclude the first phase of the EBA roadmap towards the implementation of the market and counterparty credit risk frameworks in the EU.These final draft technical standards cover 11 mandates and have been grouped in three different documents: the final RTS on liquidity horizons for the IMA; the final draft RTS on back-testing and profit and loss attribution (PLA) requirements; and the final draft RTS on criteria for assessing the modellability of risk factors under the IMA.The final draft RTS on liquidity horizons for the IMA clarify how institutions are to map the risk factors to the relevant category and subcategory, along with specifications with respect to the list of currencies and currency pairs that can be mapped to a 10-day liquidity horizon under the interest rate and the foreign-exchange risk category. Finally, they provide a definition of large and small capitalisation reflecting the specificities of the EU equity market.The final draft RTS on back-testing and PLA requirements specify the elements to be included for the purpose of those tests in the hypothetical, actual, and risk-theoretical P&L (HPL, APL and RTPL respectively). Furthermore, they set all key-elements characterising the PLA requirements: the tests ensuring that HPL and RTPL are sufficiently close, the consequences for institutions with desks where those changes are not close, the frequency at which the assessment of the PLA requirement has to be performed. Finally, they also set the aggregation formula that institutions are to use for aggregating the own funds requirements.The final draft RTS on criteria for assessing the modellability of risk factors under the IMA set out the criteria for identifying the risk factors that are modellable and that institutions are, therefore, allowed to include in their expected shortfall calculations. The modellability assessment is intended to ensure that only risk factors, which are sufficiently liquid and observable, are included into expected shortfall calculations so that reliable risk measures are calculated. The technical standards also set the frequency under which the modellability assessment should be performed by institutions.The adoption of those RTS is expected, under the current Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR2), to trigger the three-year period after which institutions with the permission to use the FRTB internal models are required, for reporting purposes only, to calculate their own funds requirements for market risk with those internal models.In light of the current situation linked to COVID-19, these RTS will not impose a burden on the industry today. On the contrary, the EBA trusts that providing early information to all market participants about key aspects for the EU implementation of the FRTB framework will be beneficial to ensure a smooth and harmonised process.In this context, the EBA also acknowledges and welcomes the decision by the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) to defer the implementation date of the revised market risk framework by one year to 1 January 2023, which will also allow EU banks to benefit from a longer implementation time.Legal basisThese final draft RTS have been developed according to Article 325bd(7), 325be(3), 325bf(9), 325bg(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019.Article 325bd(7), mandates the EBA to develop RTS to specify: (a) how institutions are to map the risk factors of the positions to broad categories of risk factors and broad sub-categories of risk factors; (b) which currencies constitute the most liquid currencies sub-category of the broad category of interest rate risk factor; (c) which currency pairs constitute the most liquid currency pairs sub-category of the broad category of foreign exchange risk factor; (d) the definitions of small market capitalisation and large market capitalisation for the purposes of the equity price and volatility sub-category of the broad category of equity risk factor.Article 325be(3), mandates the EBA to develop RTS to specify the criteria to assess the modellability of risk factors and to specify the frequency of that assessment.Article 325bf(9), mandates the EBA to develop RTS to specify the technical elements to be included in the actual and hypothetical changes to the value of the portfolio of an institution for the purposes of the back-testing.Article 325bg(4), mandates the EBA to develop RTS to specify: (a) the criteria necessary to ensure that the theoretical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio is sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio, taking into account international regulatory developments; (b) the consequences for an institution where the theoretical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio are not sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio; (c) the frequency at which the P&L attribution is to be performed by an institution; (d) the technical elements to be included in the theoretical and hypothetical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio for the purposes of the P&L attribution; (e) the manner in which institutions that use the internal model are to aggregate the total own funds requirement for market risk for all their trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk, taking into account the consequences referred to in point (b).The EBA is legally mandated to deliver these mandates by the 28 March 2020.

These clarifications will help ensure consistency and comparability in risk metrics across the whole EU banking sector, which are crucial to monitor the effects of the current crisis. The EBA also reminds financial institutions of their consumer protection obligations, temporarily lifts some reporting obligations for payment service providers (PSPs), and calls on PSPs to raise their contactless payment thresholds to the legal limit.The EBA supports the measures taken and proposed by national governments and EU bodies to address the adverse systemic economic impact of the coronavirus in the form of general moratoria. The statement clarifies the implications of moratoria on the prudential and accounting treatment of the exposures, but reiterates that it is crucial that the classification of exposures accurately and timely reflects any deterioration of asset quality.In particular, the EBA clarified that generalised payment delays due to legislative initiatives and addressed to all borrowers do not lead to any automatic classification in default, forborne or unlikeliness to pay. Individual assessments of the likeliness to pay should be prioritised. \u00a0The EBA also highlighted that when applying the IFRS 9 international accounting standard, institutions are expected to use a certain degree of judgement and distinguish between borrowers whose credit standing would not be significantly affected by the current situation in the long term, and those who would be unlikely to restore their creditworthiness. \u00a0The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) also issued a Statement with further guidance on the accounting implications of the economic support and relief measures adopted by EU Member States in response to the COVID-19 crisis.Whilst ensuring flexibility on the prudential side to support generalised payment delays, the EBA emphasised there is no flexibility in relation to consumer protection. The EBA called on all lenders to act in the interest of consumers.\u00a0 In particular making sure that customers fully understand the implications of taking up any measures, without hidden charges and that such new terms should not have automatic adverse impacts on the customer\u2019s credit rating.The EBA finally noted the importance of orderly payments services during this period, recommended the use of contactless payments up to EUR50 and encouraged consumers and merchants to take sanitary measures and consider all payment options when paying in-store.

Although the long-term magnitude of the economic shock cannot yet be quantified, it will likely dampen economic activity.Since the financial crisis, European banks have strengthened their capital position, built up solid liquidity buffer and improved the quality of the assets on their balance sheets. EU banks have implemented measures to ensure business continuity and adequate service to their customers, but they are facing operational challenges, hence the need to focus on their core operations and critical functions. Supervisors are working with banks as they maintain their support to household and corporate sectors, particularly to small and medium enterprises, and ensure that the basic needs of their customers are satisfied.The EBA, along with national competent authorities (CAs) and the European Central Bank, is coordinating a joint effort to alleviate the immediate operational burden for banks at this challenging juncture. The EBA recommends CAs to make full use, where appropriate, of the flexibility embedded in the regulatory framework to support the banking sector.Supporting banks\u2019 focus on core operationsAddressing any operational challenges banks may face should be the priority. \u00a0The EBA has decided to postpone the EU-wide stress test exercise to 2021. This will allow banks to focus on and ensure continuity of their core operations, including support for their customers. For 2020, the EBA will carry out an additional EU-wide transparency exercise in order to provide updated information on banks\u2019 exposures and asset quality to market participants.In addition, the EBA recommends CAs to plan supervisory activities, including on-site inspections, in a pragmatic and flexible way, and possibly postpone those deemed non-essential. CAs could also give banks some leeway in the remittance dates for some areas of supervisory reporting, without putting at stake the crucial information needed to monitor closely banks\u2019 financial and prudential situation.Making use of the flexibility already embedded in existing regulationA number of provisions in the regulatory framework ensure that banks build up adequate capital and liquidity buffers. These buffers, including macroprudential ones, are designed to be used in order to absorb losses and ensure continued lending to the economy during a downturn. Banks should also follow prudent dividend and other distribution policies, including variable remuneration.CAs are encouraged, where appropriate, to make full use of the flexibility already embedded in the existing regulatory framework. The ECB-Banking Supervision\u2019s decision to allow banks to cover Pillar 2 requirements with capital instruments other than common equity tier 1 (CET1) is an example. The use of Pillar 2 Guidance is another way to ensure that prudential regulation is countercyclical and banks can provide the necessary support to the household and corporate sectors.The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is also designed to be used by banks under stress. Supervisors should avoid any measures that may lead to the fragmentation of funding markets.It is crucial that the classification of exposures accurately and timely reflects any deterioration of asset quality. There is, however, flexibility in the implementation of the EBA Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures and the EBA calls for a close dialogue between supervisors and banks, also on their non-performing exposure strategies, on a case by case basis.The EBA is in close contact with the European Systemic Risk Board in order to ensure that microprudential and macroprudential measures are fully aligned.

In this Opinion the EBA calls for the implementation of the final Basel III framework as agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.The main concerns raised in the feedback received relate to LGD applied to the exposures to the insurance companies under the IRB Approach without the use of own estimates of LGD, especially in the context of the changes introduced in the final Basel III framework published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in December 2017. These reforms disallow the use of own estimates of LGD for exposures to financial institutions, including insurance companies. As a result, the regulatory values of LGD have to be used also where the effects of credit insurance used as credit risk mitigation is recognised through substitution of risk parameters. This was commented as overly punitive given the higher seniority of claims from policy insurance over other claims towards insurance undertakings. The analysis presented in the Opinion leads to the conclusion that there should not be a specific value of regulatory LGD for credit insurance claims. While higher seniority typically applies to claims from insurance policies, due to the specific structure of the balance sheets of the insurance undertakings, most of the claims in the unwinding proceedings would benefit from such priority. As a result, in case of failure of an insurance company the insurance policy holders may still suffer from significant losses, especially in the conditions of economic downturn. In particular, there is no evidence that these losses would be significantly lower than the currently applicable regulatory LGD values.The Opinion points out that the final Basel III framework has been calibrated at the overall level and as such should be implemented in the EU in line with the international agreement. It is also stressed that specifying any preferential treatment for the claims on credit insurance policies would not be compliant with the final Basel III framework.This Opinion is also submitted to the European Commission to inform its current work on the proposal for the revisions of the Capital Requirements Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 575/2013) in relation to the implementation of the final Basel III framework.

This Chapter, which is part of the EBA Handbook on valuation for purposes of resolution, aims at enhancing institutions\u2019 preparedness in business as usual to support a timely and robust valuation in case of resolution.

The measure is primarily driven by persistent macroprudential risks in the Belgian economy related to a substantial level of systemic risk in banks\u2019 mortgage portfolios and of macrofinancial vulnerabilities. Based on the evidence submitted, the EBA does not object to the extension of the proposed measure, which will be applied from 1 May 2020 to 30 April 2021.The measure for that the extension is intended to increase the risk weights for internal ratings based (IRB) banks\u2019 retail exposures secured by residential immovable property located in Belgium and consists of two components. The first component imposes a 5-percentage-point risk weight add-on for IRB banks\u2019 exposures to mortgage loans. The second component further increases the risk weights as a function of the risk profile of the IRB bank\u2019s mortgage portfolio by applying a multiplier of 1.33 on the (microprudential) risk weight.In its Opinion, addressed to the Council, the European Commission and the NBB, the EBA acknowledges, in line with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the sustained high level of systemic risk in Belgian banks\u2019 mortgage portfolios and the persistence of macroprudential vulnerabilities in the Belgian financial system. The combined increase in house prices and debt levels may pose a threat to the financial stability of banks in Belgium in the event of a downturn.In light of this conclusion, the EBA does not object to the extended deployment, by the NBB, of the proposed macroprudential measures, which will be applied from 1 May 2020 to 30 April 2021.BackgroundAlready in its Opinion issued on 23 February 2018, the EBA did not object to the adoption of this measure, taking into consideration its effect on increasing the resilience of the Belgian banking sector.

While the EBA observes overall progress in institutions\u2019 prudential disclosures, some practices may still impair the proper communication of their risk profile in a comparable way, compromising the ultimate objective of market discipline.Institutions\u2019 Pillar 3 disclosures play a key role in promoting market discipline through the public reporting of meaningful prudential information. The definition and implementation of a common Pillar 3 framework with granular and comparable prudential disclosures is a major step towards reducing asymmetry of information with users of prudential information.The aim of this Report is to assess the implementation by institutions of thePillar 3 framework as well as of identifying best practices and potential areas for improvement that should help institutions enhance their own disclosures and which will be a valid input to the EBA\u2019s policy work on Pillar 3.The EBA observes that institutions are on the correct path towards achieving consistency and comparability through the implementation of common disclosure formats, accompanied by qualitative explanations that help communicate meaningful prudential information. There is, nevertheless, room for improvement. In particular, the following findings may hamper the ability of users to access, understand and compare the information:Omission of information without any indication of the reasons;Unclear identification and location of Pillar\u00a03 reports that hinders the ability of users to find them;Lack of consistency in the structure of Pillar 3 reports and of some of the information reported, particularly qualitative information;Oversimplification of interim reports compared to end-of-year reports;Lack of reconciliation of quantitative information across disclosure templates or inconsistent ways to calculate quantitative flows of information.The EBA also observes that whileenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) related information is still scarce and diffuse, institutions are starting to embed sustainability considerations in their strategic agenda and to recognise environmental and climate change risks as emerging risks.Note to the editorsThe assessment covers 12 systemically important credit institutions.

The EBA assessed the information obtained from national authorities, from a sample of intermediaries and through desk-based research and concluded that no amendments to the RTS are currently required.In this Report, the EBA provides an overview of the legal basis of its work, the methodological approach used and its assessment on whether to amend the RTS at this point in time. Based on this assessment, the EBA concludes that there is currently no evidence that would suggest that the PII minimum monetary amounts would need to be amended.In reaching this conclusion, the EBA stresses that its mandate laid down in the MCD only refers to the threshold amounts themselves. The mandate does not extend to the EBA assessing, for example, the extent to which the usage of the minimum payout amounts prescribed in the RTS are potentially impeded by specific clauses in PII contracts; the nature of the comparable guarantee(s) that may be used in the market; or what should be understood as a \u201ccomparable guarantee\u201d at all. The EBA, therefore, did not analyse those elements or conducted any thorough assessment of the contents of the insurance contracts.Legal basis and next stepsThis Report has been developed in accordance with Article 29(2)(a) of Directive 2014/17/ EU on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property (MCD), which mandates the EBA to review, and if necessary, develop draft RTSs to amend the minimum monetary amount of the professional indemnity insurance or comparable guarantee, for submission to the EU Commission by 21 March 2018 and every two years thereafter. Given the late transposition of the MCD in some Member States, the EBA decided in early 2018 to postpone the review by two years, from 2018 to 2020.In order to fulfil the above mandate, the EBA assessed the responses to a survey sent by National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to the ten largest credit intermediaries in their respective jurisdiction, intelligence gathered from national authorities themselves, and desk-based research.The RTS on PII were published in the Official Journal in October 2014 as Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1125/2014, set the minimum monetary amount of the PII or comparable guarantee for mortgage credit intermediaries by specifying an amount for each individual claim (EUR 460,000) and an aggregate amount per calendar year for all claims (EUR 750,000).The EBA will review the RTS on PII every two years.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-reviews-its-rts-professional-indemnity-insurance-mortgage-credit-intermediaries"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0317", "date": "2020-02-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA updates list of institutions involved in the 2020 supervisory benchmarking exercise", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today an updated list of institutions, which have a reporting obligation for the purpose of the 2020 EU supervisory benchmarking exercise.

The report shows that authorities have made strong progress in agreeing resolution strategies and setting related MREL requirements but it also notes that banks need to issue MREL eligible debt to close their shortfall.222 European banks representing 80% of total assets are covered by a resolution strategy other than liquidation. This is reflective of the fact that authorities have progressed since the introduction of BRRD in 2014 and the fact that the majority of European banking assets are held by large and complex banking groups for which liquidation is not deemed appropriate.On a weighted average basis, MREL requirements in the EU range between 26.5% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) for the global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) \u2013 the largest and most complex banks \u2013 and 19% of RWAs for the banks with total assets below EUR\u00a01\u00a0billion that are neither G-SIIs nor other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs). Overall, MREL levels are reflective of banks\u2019 going-concern requirements; in the case of transfer strategies, MREL levels also reflect the scaling down of MREL based on the transfer perimeter.105 banks out of 222 sample already meet their requirement while the rest reported an estimated MREL shortfall of EUR178bn. While this is significant, it is worth noting that 65 of those banks with shortfalls also report instruments totaling EUR67bn that are close in nature to MREL but not eligible. This shows that some banks already have a sophisticated investor base, likely to invest in long-term unsecured debt such as MREL eligible instruments.In the light of these shortfalls, the EBA encourages European resolution groups to take advantage of the current positive market conditions to issue and build up resources. As pointed out in the recent EBA risk assessment report, despite continued volatility, spreads for all market instrument have been on a downward trend for most of 2019, with spreads between secured and unsecured as well as between senior and subordinated instruments narrowing.Note to the editors \u00a0The Report is based on data provided by resolution authorities and covers the actual population of banks covered by an MREL decision, the actual level of this requirement and the level of resources effectively eligible in the relevant jurisdictions.The Report, which will be updated annually in line as mandate by BRRD Art 45l(1), is accompanied by a factsheet.

This consultation paper is setting pre-determined dimensions or components of exposures, which competent or designated authorities should use when defining a subset of sectoral exposures in the application of a systemic risk buffer. A pre-condition when defining a subset of sectoral exposures is its systemic relevance according to a qualitative and quantitative assessment conducted by the relevant authority. The consultation paper recommends three criteria to be used in such assessments: size, riskiness and interconnection. This consultation paper sets out general principles to ensure the right balance between addressing the systemic risk stemming from the identified subset of sectoral exposures and the unintended consequences when applying a sectoral SyRB to this subset.

No changes are proposed concerning the minimum target level for ex-ante funds.The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its third and final Opinion addressed to the European Commission on the implementation of the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD) in the EU. The Opinion focuses on deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) funding and uses of DGS funds and proposes a number of changes to the EU legal framework, aimed at strengthening depositor protection, enhancing financial stability and reinforcing financial resilience of DGSs.In its Opinion, the EBA assesses 33 different topics related to DGS funding and uses of DGS funds and sets out 23 proposals on how to improve current EU legal framework.In particular, the EBA calls for the need to clarify in the DGSD what funds should count towards the DGS\u2019s available financial means (i.e. ex-ante funds), and when different DGS funding sources (including loans) can be used and under what conditions. The Opinion also addresses the need to introduce more transparency in relation to the reporting of DGS funds, more consistency in the approach to payment commitments, and more precision in the DGSD in relation to how DGS funds should be invested.In addition, the Opinion recommends the need for the Commission to consider further the consequences of the recent General Court ruling in the Tercas case, concerning the use of DGS funds to prevent failure of credit institutions and the ceiling up to which DGS funds can be used for such failure prevention. The Commission should also consider introducing in the EU framework the possibility to use failed institution\u2019s assets to repay depositors.No changes are proposed to the current DGSD provisions in relation to the minimum target level for the ex-ante funds, the target level basis and the possibility for DGSs to continue collecting contributions above the minimum target level. The Opinion also recommends that there is no need for changes in relation to contributions from third country branches, or immediate changes to the risk-based contributions based on the assessment of their impact on different business models.Background informationThe third EBA Opinion on DGS funding and uses of DGS funds follows the first Opinion on eligibility of deposits, coverage level and cooperation between DGSs, published in August 2019, and the second Opinion on DGS payouts, published in October 2019. In the three Opinions, the EBA assessed 115 topics and proposed 81 improvements to the current EU legal framework with the aim of further strengthening the depositor protection framework, improving depositor information, reinforcing operational effectiveness of DGSs, harmonising approaches across EU Member States and, ultimately, enhancing financial stability and ensuring that depositors are well protected.The proposals in the first Opinion included, among others, changes to the current framework to ensure that across the EU depositors are protected by one of the EU DGSs, even if they hold their deposits at a branch of a credit institution from a non-EU country. Conversely, the Opinion proposed that EU DGSs should not protect deposits placed with branches of EU credit institutions operating outside the EU \u2013 this is particularly relevant in relation to the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. The Opinion also put forward a number of improvements to how depositors are informed about DGS protection, and proposed to consider expanding the list of deposits eligible for protection, including deposits made by public authorities and those held as deposits by financial institutions on behalf of their clients. No changes were proposed to the current coverage level of EUR 100,000.The second Opinion proposed changes aimed at ensuring that depositors are not unduly left without access to their funds when the decision \u00a0that deposits have become unavailable has not (yet) been made by the authorities. The Opinion proposed that, in such instances, depositors should have access to an appropriate daily amount from their deposits. Similarly, the EBA recommended that the EU framework could benefit from more clarity on DGS payouts where there are money laundering/ terrorism financing concerns. Throughout the Opinion, the EBA underlined the importance of enhancing depositor protection, and clearly informing depositors about the most relevant features of such protection, in normal times, as well as during a DGS payout. Finally, the Opinion proposed further work to establish the best way to reimburse depositors who have placed deposits with credit institutions protected by DGSs other Member States.Legal basisArticle 19(6) DGSD requires the EBA to support the EU Commission in its development of a report on the progress towards the implementation of the DGSD. The Opinion on DGS funding and uses of DGS funds is the third part of the EBA\u2019s fulfilment of this mandate, which should be read alongside two other Opinions \u2013 on eligibility of deposits, coverage level and cooperation between DGSs, and on DGS payouts.The EBA invites the Commission to consider the proposals outlined in the Opinions when preparing a report on the implementation of the DGSD to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-puts-forward-concrete-proposals-improve-current-dgsd-legal-framework"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0322", "date": "2020-02-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA issues Opinion on measures to address macroprudential risk following notification by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB)", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today an Opinion following the notification by the Central Bank of the Netherlands (De Nederlandsche Bank \u2013 DNB) of its intention to modify capital requirements in order to address an increase in macroprudential risk. Based on the evidence submitted by the DNB, the EBA does not object to the adoption of the proposed measure, which is based on Article 458 (2) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). This new measure aims at enhancing the resilience of the Dutch banking sector to a potential severe downturn in the residential real estate market against the background of sustained price increases in real estate over the past few years.In particular, the DNB notified the EBA of its intention to introduce a new macroprudential measure, which consists of a minimum average risk weight floor at the portfolio level based on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the individual loans. More specially, a 12% risk weight is assigned to the portion of the loan not exceeding 55% of the market value of the property that serves to secure the loan, and a 45% risk weight is assigned to the remaining portion of the loan. If the LTV ratio is lower or equal to 55, then a fixed 12% risk weight is assigned to the loan.In its Opinion, addressed to the Council, the European Commission and the DNB, the EBA acknowledges, in line with the ESRB recommendation on medium-term vulnerabilities in the residential real estate sector in the Netherlands, the concerns on the build-up of risk in this sector, the large proportion of high-LTV loans, high level of indebtedness in Dutch households and the low risk weights for real estate exposures by Dutch IRB banks.

Competent authorities also need to strengthen their approach to ensuring compliance by taking more proportionate and sufficiently dissuasive measures to correct deficiencies in banks\u2019 AML/CFT systems and controls.\u00a0 Finally, the EBA found that not all competent authorities were able to cooperate effectively with domestic and international stakeholders to draw on synergies and to position AML/CFT in the wider national and international supervisory framework.The EBA\u2019s findings and associated recommendations are relevant to all AML/CFT competent authorities regardless of whether they were included in this year\u2019s sample.Note to editorsThe European Union (EU) has a comprehensive legal framework to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing. Nevertheless, there has been a constant stream of high profile ML/TF cases involving European banks. These scandals, together with findings by international AML/CFT assessment bodies, point to deficiencies in some competent authorities\u2019 approaches to their AML/CFT supervision of banks, have led to suggestions that supervisors should do more to ensure that Europe\u2019s AML/CFT framework is implemented consistently and effectively. The EBA, therefore, decided to review the effectiveness of national competent authorities\u2019 approaches to the AML/CFT supervision of banks, and to support individual competent authorities\u2019 AML/CFT efforts.The EBA has a new legal mandate to lead, coordinate and monitor the financial sector\u2019s fight against ML/TF across the EU.

This update takes into account changes to the EU Anti Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing (AML/CFT) legal framework and new ML/TF risks, including those identified by the EBA\u2019s implementation reviews. These Guidelines are central to the EBA\u2019s work to lead, coordinate and monitor the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, explained in the accompanying factsheet. The consultation runs until 06 July\u00a02020. These Guidelines, which are addressed to both financial institutions and supervisors, set out factors that institutions should consider when assessing the ML/TF risk associated with a business relationship or occasional transaction. In addition, they provide guidance on how financial institutions can adjust their customer due diligence measures to mitigate the ML/TF risk they have identified.\u00a0Finally, they support competent authorities\u2019 AML/CFT supervision efforts when assessing the adequacy of firms\u2019 risk assessments and AML/CFT policies and procedures. In its revised version, the EBA is proposing key changes, including new guidance on compliance with the provisions on enhanced customer due diligence related to high-risk third countries. New sectoral guidelines have been added on crowdfunding platforms, corporate finance, payment initiation services providers (PISPs) and account information service providers (AISPs) and for firms providing activities of currency exchanges offices. The revised Guidelines also provide more details on\u00a0terrorist financing risk factors and customer due diligence (CDD) measures including on the identification of the beneficial owner, the use of innovative solutions to identify and verify the customers\u2019 identity. In addition, they set clear regulatory expectations of firms\u2019 business-wide and individual ML/TF risk assessments. The proposed changes will significantly strengthen Europe\u2019s AML/CFT defences and foster greater convergence of supervisory practices in areas where supervisory effectiveness has been hampered, so far, by divergent approaches in the implementation of the same European legal requirements. Consultation process Comments to the draft Guidelines can be sent by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the EBA's consultation page. Please note that that due to the current Covid-19 situation the deadline for the submission of comments has been extended to 6 July 2020. All contributions received will be published following the close of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.\r \tThe EBA will hold a public hearing on the draft Guidelines, which will take place via conference call on 15 May 2020 from 14:00 to 16:00 Paris time. The dial in details will be communicated in due course. Legal Basis and background Article 17 and 18 of Directive (EU) No 2015/849, mandate the ESAs to issue Guidelines addressed to both Competent Authorities and to credit and financial institutions on the risk factors to be considered and the measures to be taken in situations where simplified customer due diligence and enhanced customer due diligence are appropriate. In June 2017, the three ESAs issued Guidelines on customer due diligence and the factors credit and financial institutions should consider when assessing the money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with individual business relationships and occasional transactions (JC 2017 37). Since then, the applicable legislative framework in the EU has changed. On 9 July 2018, Directive (EU) 2018/843 (AMLD5) entered into force and is applicable from 10 January 2020. Moreover, new risks have emerged and have been identified in the ESAs\u2019 2019 Joint Opinion. The European Commission\u2019s post mortem report and the EBA\u2019s implementation reviews has highlighted widespread challenges in the operationalisation and supervision of the risk-based approach to AML/CFT. Therefore, a review of the original Risk Factors Guidelines was warranted. The scope of the EBA\u2019s consultation is limited to the amendments and additions to the original risk factors Guidelines, which will be repealed and replaced with the revised Guidelines. The EBA has a new legal mandate to lead coordinate and monitor the financial sector\u2019s fight against ML/TF across the EU.

Based on data as of September 2018, still many institutions, 41.61% out of 834, have not adopted a diversity policy. The representation of women in management bodies is still relatively low and many institutions do not have a gender diverse board. The EBA calls on institutions and Member States to consider additional measures for promoting a more balanced representation of both genders and on competent authorities to ensure institutions\u2019 compliance with the requirement to adopt diversity policies.More diverse management bodies can help improve decision-making regarding strategies and risk-taking by incorporating a broader range of views, opinions, experiences, perceptions, values and backgrounds. All institutions are required to adopt a policy promoting diversity within their management bodies. The issue of diversity is not limited to gender; it also concerns the age, professional and educational background, and geographical provenance of the members of the management body. Despite the legal requirements, a significant proportion of institutions have still not adopted a diversity policy and not all institutions that have adopted a diversity policy promote gender diversity by setting a target for the under-represented gender.The gender representation in institutions\u2019 management bodies continued to differ significantly between Member States. At EU-wide level, in 2018, two thirds (66.95%) of institutions had executive directors of only one gender. In nearly all such cases, the board was composed only of men. The situation in the largest institutions in each Member State (significant institutions) improved slightly but in 2018 was still not satisfactory as 50.63% of them (60.34% in 2015) had no female members of the management body in their management function. With regard to the supervisory function, 70.78% of institutions have non-executive directors of both genders.The overall representation of women in management bodies in their management function has improved slightly, reaching 15.13% in 2018 (2015, 13.63%), and their representation in management bodies in their supervisory function has improved significantly, reaching 24.02% (18.90% in 2015).The EBA analysed whether there was in 2018 a correlation between the profitability of a credit institution and the composition of the executive directors within the management body Credit institutions that have executive directors of both genders seem to have a higher probability of a return on equity (ROE) at or above the average of 6.42% than credit institutions with executive directors of only one gender. While 54.70% of the credit institutions with more gender-balanced management bodies in their management function have an ROE at or above 6.42%, only 40.69% of those with executive directors of just one gender reach that ROE level. Moreover, the average ROE for institutions with gender-diverse management functions is above the average for other institutions (7.28% versus 5.95% respectively).The EBA also collected data on remuneration for the management body to establish if there is a gender pay gap. In most institutions, the remuneration of male members of the management body is higher than that for female members. This can partly be explained by the fact that only 8.53% of chief executive officers (CEOs) and 9.49% of chairpersons are female, and higher remuneration is usually paid for those functions. However, the different roles alone cannot explain the observed differences in pay.Legal basis and next stepsThis report has been developed in line with Article 91 (11) of Directive 2013/36/EC which requires Competent Authorities to collect the information disclosed on the diversity policy, and the extent to which these objectives and targets have been achieved in accordance with Article 435(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and shall use it to benchmark diversity practices. Competent Authorities shall provide the EBA with this information, which shall be used to benchmark diversity practices at European Union (EU) level.Under the amended Directive 2013/36/EU, the EBA is mandated to benchmark gender-neutral remuneration practices, and it will carry out further work in this area. The EBA will continue to monitor diversity in management bodies and issue periodical benchmark studies on diversity.Visualisation toolVisualisation tool on benchmarking of diversity in 2019 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-calls-measures-ensure-more-balanced-composition-management-bodies-institutions"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0327", "date": "2020-01-31", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA launches 2020 EU-wide stress test exercise", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today the 2020 EU-wide stress test, the fifth exercise since its establishment, and released the macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenario follows for the first time a \u2018lower for longer\u2019 narrative, a recession coupled with low or negative interest rates for a prolonged period. The EU real GDP would decline by 4.3% cumulatively by 2022, resulting in the most severe scenario to date. The EBA expects to publish the results of the exercise by 31 July 2020.Key features of the exerciseThe stress test is designed to provide supervisors, banks and other market participants with a common analytical framework to consistently compare and assess the resilience of EU banks to economic shocks. In line with the previous two exercises, no pass-fail threshold has been included as the results of the exercise are designed to serve as an input to the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).The EBA\u2019s 2020 stress test methodology was published in November 2019 [1] and is to be applied to the scenarios released today.Key elements of the scenariosThe baseline scenario for EU countries is based on the projections from the national central banks of December 2019 [2], while the adverse scenario assumes the materialisation of the main financial stability risks that have been identified by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and which the EU banking sector is exposed to. The adverse scenario also reflects recent risk assessments by the EBA.The narrative depicts an adverse scenario related to a prolonged period of historically low interest rates coupled with a strong drop in confidence leading to a significant weakening of economic growth in EU countries. This is amplified by trade tensions at the global level. Slowing growth momentum and/or rising risk premia could further challenge debt sustainability in the public and private sectors across the EU.The possible prolongation of negative growth and the low interest rate environment could further exacerbate the search for yield behaviour by investors, leading to under-pricing of risks and asset price misalignments, which could reverse as market sentiment changes and/or risks materialise.The adverse scenario is designed to ensure an adequate level of severity across all EU countries. By 2022, the EU real GDP would decline by 4.3% cumulatively, the unemployment rate would rise by 3.5 percentage points, equity prices in global financial markets would fall by 25% in advanced economies and by 40% in emerging economies, residential real estate prices would decline by 16%, and commercial real estate prices would decline by 20%.Detailed information about the adverse scenario can be found in the note produced by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).ProcessThe adverse macroeconomic scenario has been developed by the ESRB and the ECB in close cooperation with the EBA, competent authorities and national central banks.The EBA, who is responsible for coordinating the whole exercise, developed a common methodology and will act as a data hub for the final dissemination of the results, in line with its commitment to enhancing the transparency of the EU banking sector. Competent authorities will assure the quality of the results and decide on any necessary supervisory reaction measure as part of the SREP process.\u00a0Notes for editorsThe EU-wide stress test will be conducted on a sample of 51 EU banks \u2013 35 from countries under the jurisdiction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) \u2013 covering roughly 70% of total banking sector assets in the EU and Norway, as expressed in terms of total consolidated assets as of end 2018. UK banks will be included in the sample as the 2020 EU-wide stress test takes place during the implementation period following the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU.The exercise will be run at the highest level of consolidation. This exercise will involve close cooperation between the EBA and the competent authorities (including the SSM, the ECB and the ESRB).(1) In the package that was published today, the sample has been revised.(2)\u00a0For non EU-countries, the projections are mainly based on the projections from the October 2019 IMF World Economic Outlook and on the November 2019 OECD Economic Outlook.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-launches-2020-eu-wide-stress-test-exercise"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0328", "date": "2020-01-31", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA releases its annual assessment of the consistency of internal model outcomes", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today two Reports on the consistency of risk weighted assets (RWAs) across all EU institutions authorised to use internal approaches for the calculation of capital requirements. The reports cover credit risk for high and low default portfolios (LDPs and HDPs), as well as market risk. The results confirm that the majority of risk-weights (RWs) variability can be explained by fundamentals. These benchmarking exercises are a fundamental supervisory and convergence tool to address unwarranted inconsistencies and restoring trust in internal models.Credit Risk exerciseThe credit risk Report examines the different drivers leading to the observed dispersion across banks' models. The results are broadly in line with previous exercises, with 50% of the difference in variability explained with simple risk drivers (\u201ctop down analysis\u201d), a RW deviation on LDPs below 10 percentage points (\u201ccommon counterparty analysis\u201d) and estimates for HDPs generally on the conservative side when compared with empirical observed metrics (\u201cbacktesting analysis\u201d).Furthermore, this year, for the first time, on HDPs, the EBA performed a comparison with the standardised approach (SA) risk weights. The overall observed variability under the SA is at a similar level than the one observed on IRB. In this regard, within a single exposure class, the variability under the IRB approach follows, in a conservative manner, the empirical variability of risk (observed via default rates). On the other side, it is worth noting that the variability of RWAs in the SA is less linked to the empirical risk variability.As in previous years, the quantitative analysis is complemented with a qualitative one in order to better understand the quantitative metric of the exercise. In addition to a questionnaire filled in by supervisors and interviews conducted with seven institutions, a survey was carried out among institutions to better assess the variability of practices in terms of rating scales. This survey highlights the variability of practices on the type of calibration of the probability of default (PDs).Market Risk exerciseThe Report presents the results of the 2019 supervisory benchmarking and summarises the conclusions drawn from a hypothetical portfolio exercise (HPE) that was conducted by the EBA during 2018/19.The 2019 exercise is the first exercise with the new set of hypothetical instruments and portfolios. The new set of instruments mainly consists of vanilla instruments and is more extensive in terms of the number of instruments to model with respect to the three previous benchmarking exercises. Compared to the previous exercises, the 2019 analysis shows a substantial reduction in terms of dispersion in the initial market valuation and some reduction in risk measures, especially for the aggregated portfolios. This improvement was expected and is likely due to the simplification in the market risk benchmarking instruments. The remaining dispersion is probably the result of new benchmarking instruments being used by banks for the first timeAs for the dispersion, the bulk of it has been examined and justified by the banks and the competent authorities. A minor part of the outlier observations remain unexplained and are expected to be part of the on-going supervisory activities.The quantitative analysis, which has been extended in terms of scope with respect to the previous exercises, was also complemented by a questionnaire to competent authorities. Although the majority of the causes were identified, and actions put in place to reduce the unwanted variability of the hypothetical RWAs, the effectiveness of these actions can be evaluated only with on-going analysis.Note to the editorsThese annual benchmarking exercises contribute to the work the EBA is conducting for improving the regulatory framework, increase convergence of supervisory practices and, thus, restoring confidence in internal models. For credit risk internal models, the EBA has followed its roadmap for the implementation of the regulatory review of internal models.This exercise should be read in parallel with other efforts to reduce undue levels of variability. In particular, the \u00a0EBA roadmap to repair IRB models is a key component of the review of the IRB framework, along with the enhancements brought by the final Basel\u00a0III framework assessed by the EBA in a set of recommendations as an answer to the call for advice of the European Commission.The exercises provide a regular supervisory tool based on benchmarks to support competent authorities' assessments of internal models and produce comparisons with EU peers.

The Commission\u2019s decision follows the EBA\u2019s assessment of non-EU countries' equivalence with the EU prudential supervision and regulatory requirements. In its\u00a0Opinion, in November 2018, the EBA concluded that the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to credit institutions in Serbia and South Korea can be regarded as equivalent to that applied in the Union.\u00a0According to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), under well-defined conditions, certain categories of exposures to entities located in countries outside the EU can benefit from the same preferential treatment applied to EU Member States' exposures in terms of capital requirements. This would imply that EU credit institutions can apply preferential risk weights to relevant exposures to entities located in those countries. In particular, such preferential treatment is only available if and when the European Commission adopts an Implementing Decision determining that the country's prudential supervisory and regulatory requirements are at least equivalent to those applied in the EU.Against this background, and within its mandate to promote supervisory convergence, the EBA was asked by the European Commission to provide technical advice on the equivalence of the legal and supervisory regimes in countries outside the EU. Following this assessment, the EBA provided its Opinion to the Commission in November 2018 that the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to credit institutions as documented in domestic laws and regulations in Serbia and South Korea could be regarded as equivalent to those applied in the Union.As requested by the Commission, the EBA published today this Opinion after the Commission's approval and publication of the related\u00a0Decision on Equivalence.

The proposed new framework tries to balance the need to preserve comparability and conservatism, while allowing for more flexibility in order to identify banks\u2019 idiosyncratic risks.The proposal envisages two components owned by supervisors and banks respectively: the supervisory leg and the bank leg. The supervisory leg serves as the starting point for supervisory decisions and would be directly linked to the setting of Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G). The bank leg, on the other hand, allows banks to communicate their own assessment of risks in an adverse scenario.To ensure a certain level of comparability, both legs would use the same common scenarios and starting points for projecting the stress test results.The supervisory leg would be based on a common EU methodology, in line with the current constrained bottom-up approach but with the possibility for competent authorities to adjust or replace banks\u2019 estimates based on top-down models or other benchmarking tools.The methodology for the bank leg would be less prescriptive than today and give banks more discretion in calculating their projections. In practice, banks would use the same common methodology as in the supervisory leg, but would be allowed to relax the methodological constraints to the extent they can explain and disclose the rationale and impact of such deviations.The standards for the disclosure of the results should remain high. For the bank leg, the proposed disclosure is as granular as it is today, including the overall outcome in terms of capital depletion, main risk drivers, and detailed data on exposures. For the supervisory leg, granularity would be more limited in quantity, but very relevant in terms of supervisory decisions. In particular, the discussion paper seeks views on three possibilities: (i) disclosing P2G, (ii) disclosing ranges of P2G or (iii) disclosing not P2G but the CET1 capital depletion net of any supervisory adjustments so that the results are informative in terms of supervisory expectations regarding capital distribution.As for the scenario design, the discussion paper is considering costs and benefits of multiple macroeconomic scenarios. In addition, feedback is requested on the feasibility of introducing exploratory scenarios, which would focus on potential risks with very short realisations (e.g. liquidity risk) or coming from longer-term changes in the business environment (environmental, social and political) or in technology. \u00a0Consultation processComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

The aim of this assessment is to share knowledge among the stakeholders and, in particular, to ensure regulators and supervisors are well informed on the developments, in an effort to support technological neutrality across the regulatory and supervisory approaches. The need for necessary competence is becoming increasingly important, raising an important challenge for institutions, supervisors and regulators. Training and development, as well as closer engagement between the relevant stakeholders, could be an appropriate starting point for addressing this challenge.A \u2018data-driven\u2019 approach is emerging across the financial sector, affecting institutions\u2019 business strategies, risks and operations with respective changes in the mindset and culture still in progress. The EBA Report focuses on BD&AA techniques, such as machine learning (a subset of Artificial Intelligence - AI), that goes beyond the traditional business intelligence, to discover deeper insights, make predictions, or generate recommendations through different types and sources of data.Through its ongoing interaction with the relevant stakeholders and by utilising its innovation monitoring tools, the EBA observed a fast growing interest in the use of BD&AA solutions with two out of three EU credit institutions already having such solutions in production. All functions across institutions might benefit from BD&AA applications as they could improve existing services from an efficiency, productivity and cost saving perspective or create new business opportunities. In general, most institutions are currently using simpler algorithms, leveraging on their core banking data. However, the current landscape can evolve in a rapid pace in the next few years.Data management, technological infrastructure, analytics methodology, organisation and governance are the key pillars identified by the EBA to support the rollout of Advanced Analytics, along with the following \u201celements of trust\u201d that need to be properly and sufficiently addressed:EthicsExplainability and interpretabilityFairness and avoidance of biasTraceability and auditabilityData protectionData qualitySecurityConsumer protectionThe EBA is of the view that additional efforts are needed to ensure that BD&AA solutions respect and integrate these \u201celements of trust\u201d. Towards meeting this objective, a risk-based approach could apply on certain \u201celements of trust\u201d depending on the impact of each BD&AA application. For example, stricter requirements may apply on the \u201cexplainability\u201d element when there is a potential impact on business continuity or potential harm to the customer.In the area of ethics, the Report refers directly to the \u201cEthics guidelines for trustworthy AI\u201d developed by the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI set by the European Commission.The EBA will continue monitoring the developments in line with the pace of employment of new technologies in financial services and, where appropriate, will perform additional work to enhance supervisory consistency and facilitate supervisory coordination.Legal basis and backgroundThe Report has been drafted pursuant to Article 9(2) of the EBA's Founding Regulation which mandates the Authority to monitor new and existing financial activities. This obligation extends to all areas of the EBA's competence, including in the field of activities of credit institutions, financial conglomerates, investment firms, payment institutions, and electronic money institutions.\u00a0The Report delivers also on the EBA's FinTech Roadmap, published in March 2018, which identified the monitoring of emerging trends and analyses of the prudential risks and opportunities arising from the use of FinTech, as its priorities for 2018/2019.

The consultation runs until 10 June 2020.The draft standards specify the value of non-trading book positions that institutions should use when computing the own funds requirements for market risk for those positions. In this respect, the standards require that institutions should use either the last available accounting value or the last available fair value for positions attracting foreign-exchange risk. In addition, institutions are not requested to perform a daily re-valuation of non-trading book positions attracting foreign-exchange risk. However, they are required to reflect on a daily basis the changes in the foreign-exchange component. For positions attracting commodity risk, a daily fair-valuation should be performed.In addition, the draft standards lay down a prudential treatment for the calculation of the own funds requirements for market risk of non-monetary items held at historical cost that may be impaired due to changes in the foreign-exchange rate. In this respect, the standards identify a specific methodology that institutions should use when capitalising the foreign-exchange risk stemming from those items under the standardised approach. Furthermore, it requires institutions to model directly the risk of impairment due to changes in the relevant exchange rate in the case of an internal model approach being used.Finally, the standards specify an ad-hoc treatment with respect to the calculation of the actual and hypothetical changes associated to non-trading book positions for the purpose of the backtesting and the profit and loss attribution requirements. This is to address the issue of jumps in the value of the portfolio that may lead to over-shootings in the backtesting that are not due to changes in the foreign-exchange risk component of the price.Consultation processComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

While the capital position of EU banks remained strong and asset quality improved further, profitability contracted in Q3 2019, with a negative outlook from both banks and analysts.EU banks\u2019 capital ratios have remained stable for the third quarter in a row. The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio remained at 14.4% on a fully loaded basis, with the increase in capital compensated by a parallel expansion of risk exposure amounts (REA). The latter came together with an increase in total assets and loans.Asset quality kept on improving, even though at a slower pace. The ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) declined from 3.0% to 2.9%. Similarly, the share of Stage 2 and Stage 3 loans contracted, both by 10bps quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to 6.9% and 3.3%, respectively. The coverage ratio further declined, and stood at 44.6%, down from 44.9% in the quarter before. Looking forward, the percentage of banks expecting a deterioration in asset quality further increased, particularly for lending to small and medium enterprises (SME) and commercial real estate (CRE) financing. Notwithstanding this outlook, banks still plan to increase their SME financing as well as consumer lending.Return on equity (RoE) declined in Q3 to 6.6%, down by 40bps from the quarter before. In line with the previous quarter trend, banks' cost to income ratio contracted and stood at 63.2% in September 2019, 90bps down from Q2. An increasing volume of interest bearing assets and unchanged net interest margin (1.43%) support the trend. The share of net interest income in total net operating income rose to 58.5%, 60bps higher than in the last quarter. The RAQ results show that banks and analysts are rather pessimistic in respect of profitability trends. Only 20% of banks and 10% of analysts expect an overall increase in profitability in the next near future, compared to 25% and 20% in the previous RAQ.On the liability side, banks mainly intend to attain more bail in-able instruments (senior non-preferred and Holding Company bonds) as well as retail deposits. Analysts also expect more issuances of bail in-able debt. However, contrary to banks, the percentage of analysts expecting more preferred senior unsecured funding strongly increased. Positive expectations about the placement of MREL instruments come in parallel to decreasing concerns about MREL-eligible issuances. The percentage of banks pointing to pricing and uncertainty on required MREL amount as constraints for MREL-eligible issuance fell to 50% and 30% respectively (60% and 40% in the previous RAQ).Notes to editorsThe figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 147 banks, covering more than 80% of the EU banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates also include large subsidiaries (the list of banks can be found here).

This assessment responds to a call for advice from the European Commission as part of its Action Plan \u201cFinancing Sustainable Growth\u201d and will inform on policy actions that could be taken to ensure that long-term perspectives are adequately considered in the financial sector.The EBA assessed the potential presence and drivers of short-termism, by looking at (i) potential short-term pressures exerted by banks on corporate clients, and (ii) potential short-term pressures banks may be under on their own, by shareholders and capital markets. Furthermore, the Report assesses whether banking regulations may play a role in exacerbating or in mitigating short-termism.Overall, based on an analysis of available qualitative and quantitative sources, the EBA identifies some limited concrete evidence of short-termism, without necessarily being in a position to label it systematically as undue, and highlights the need to promote long-term approaches.On this basis, the EBA provides policy recommendations advocating that policy action should aim at providing relevant information and incentives for the banks to incorporate long-term time horizons in their strategies, governance, business activities and risk management.The EBA especially recommends to the European Commission and the EU legislators:to maintain a robust regulatory prudential framework as a pre-condition for long-term investments, while continuing monitoring potential unintended consequences of financial regulations on the supply of sustainable investment financing ;to foster the adoption of longer-term perspectives by institutions through more explicit legal provisions on sustainability in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD);to continue enhancing disclosures of long-term risks and opportunities, by both corporations and banks, by setting principles and requirements that can ensure comparability and reliability of disclosure e.g. through amendments to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive;to improve information flows, data access and support the role of the banking sector in raising awareness on sustainability challenges and environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, for example through the development of platforms or by setting-up a centralised database on environmental data for financial sector.Legal basis and next stepsThis Report responds to a European Commission\u2019s request included in its Action Plan: Financing Sustainable Growth, which aims notably to foster transparency and long-termism in financial and economic activity The European Supervisory Market Authority (ESMA) and European Insurances and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) are also publishing today a report for the entities and activities in their remit.The three ESAs have been asked to investigate potential evidence and sources of undue short-term pressures on corporations from the financial sector and provide advice on areas which regulators should address.Recommendations for policy actions have been submitted to the European Commission.The EBA is actively working on sustainable finance and has outlined its approach and timelines for delivering mandates related to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors and risks in its action plan on sustainable finance.

These draft RTS specify key aspects of the SA-CCR and represent an important contribution to its smooth harmonised implementation in the EU. The RTS are part of the mandates assigned to the EBA within its important role in implementing the SA-CCR and Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) frameworks in the EU.The final draft RTS set out the method for identifying the material risk drivers of derivative transactions on the basis of which the mapping to one or more of the risk categories is to be done. In addition, these RTS set out the formula that institutions are to use to calculate the supervisory delta of options, when mapped to the interest rate risk category, which is compatible with negative interest rates. Finally, the final draft RTS introduce a method suitable for determining the direction of the position in a material risk driver.On the mapping of derivatives into risk categories, the final draft RTS follow a three-pronged methodology for the identification of the material risk driver(s) of derivative transactions. The first approach, relies on purely qualitative information and is suitable for simple and standard derivative transactions (e.g. interest rate and cross currency swaps). The second approach is more detailed and hinges on a quantitative assessment of the sensitivities in order to classify possible risk drivers based on materiality considerations. The third approach is a conservative and simple backstop, which identifies all possible risk drivers of a transaction as material. This last approach will always be available as a fall back option and will allow a proportionate implementation of the framework when the second approach is too burdensome.The formula for the supervisory delta of interest rate options, specified in the RTS, is an application of the Black-Scholes (BS) model, on which SA-CCR relies. Such an application is made feasible by shifting the interest rate curve to move interest rates back into positive territory. In addition, the RTS specify the parameters that are to be used in the supervisory delta formula.Finally,\u00a0\u00a0for determining the direction of the position in a particular risk driver (long or short), the methodology introduced in these RTS leverages on the same elements (i.e. cash flows and sensitivities) used for the identification of the material risk driver(s) of derivative transactions, which are specifically envisaged for reducing the burden on institutions.Legal basisThe final draft RTS have been developed according to Article 277(5) and Article 279a(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876. Article 277(5) mandates the EBA to develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify: (a) the method for identifying transactions with only one material risk driver, and (b) the method for identifying transactions with more than one material risk driver and for identifying the most material of those risk drivers for the purposes of Article 277(3). Article 279a(3) mandates the EBA to develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify: (a) in accordance with international regulatory developments, the formula that institutions shall use to calculate the supervisory delta of call and put options mapped to the interest rate risk category compatible with market conditions in which interest rates may be negative as well as the supervisory volatility that is suitable for that formula, and (b) the method for determining whether a transaction is a long or short position in the primary risk driver or in the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3).

These measures are needed to strengthen the EU\u2019s AML/CFT efforts.Financial crime has no borders. Recent high profile AML/CFT cases involving EU banks suggest that in cases where firms operate in different countries, failure by AML/CFT supervisors to communicate effectively with their EU counterparts created gaps that allowed serious compliance failures to continue for long periods of time. The ESAs drafted these Guidelines to ensure that going forward, supervisors from different Member States have a formal cooperation framework that ensures adequate and effective AML/CFT supervision of firms that operate on a cross-border basis.These Guidelines require that in situations where a firm operates in more than three Member States, supervisors establish an AML/CFT college. To this end, the Guidelines have laid down rules that govern the establishment and operation of the AML/CFT colleges. These colleges will bring together AML/CFT supervisors of the same firm, as well as other relevant parties, for example prudential supervisors and AML/CFT supervisors from third countries. This is to ensure that all supervisors have access to comprehensive information about the firm and use it to inform their risk assessment and supervisory approach. The colleges will also allow the supervisors to agree on a common approach, including coordinated actions.The Guidelines also include provisions to structure supervisory cooperation in situations where the conditions for setting up an AML/CFT college are not met.Legal basis and backgroundThese joint Guidelines have been prepared in accordance with Articles 50a, 57a and 57b of Directive (EU) 2015/849 (The Fourth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive), which provide legal basis for cooperation and information exchange between AML/CFT and prudential supervisors in the EU and with authorities in third countries.The Guidelines are broadly based on, and consistent with, the framework of colleges of prudential supervisors of banks, but the scope of these Guidelines is much wider and encompases all financial sectors in a proportionate manner.

It is, therefore, essential that financial institutions are able to measure and monitor the ESG risks in order to deal with transition and physical risks. \u00a0\u00a0As the exact manifestation of transition and physical risk remains uncertain, the EBA encourages financial institutions to act now to incorporate ESG factors into their business strategies, and to identify measure and monitor ESG risks including simple metrics, such as a green asset ratio. \u00a0To this end, they can then use scenario analysis as an explorative tool to understand the relevance of the exposures affected by and the potential magnitude of the ESG risks.Jose Manuel Campa, the EBA Chairperson,\u00a0 highlighted the importance of acting now on sustainable finance and said: \u201cThe urgent need to act explains why we have also set out early expectations for interim measures, including the identification of simple metrics that can foster market discipline and allow banks to set clear green strategies\u201dTo support this, the EBA\u2019s work will follow the sequencing reflected in its legal mandates and start with a focus on strategy and risk management and associated key metrics and disclosure. In the second stage, the EBA aims to develop a dedicated climate change stress test. The third stage of the work will look into the evidence around the prudential treatment of \u201cgreen\u201d exposures. The rationale for this sequencing is the need firstly to understand institutions\u2019 current business mix from a sustainability perspective in order to measure and manage it in relation to their chosen strategy, which can then be used for scenario analysis and later for the assessment of an appropriate prudential treatment.Legal basis, background and next stepsThe EBA\u2019s remit and mandates on ESG factors and risks are set out in the following legislative acts:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 amended EBA Regulation\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR 2) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD5)\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 new Investment Firms Regulation (IFR) and Investment Firms Directive (IFD)\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commission\u2019s Action Plan: Financing Sustainable Growth and related legislative initiatives.In the context of the EBA\u2019s mandate to contribute to stability and effectiveness of the financial system, the work on sustainable finance aims to (i) improve the regulatory framework to foster their operation of institutions\u2019 in a sustainable manner and (ii) provide supervisors with adequate tools to understand, monitor and assess ESG risks in their supervisory practices.\u00a0Sustainable finance can be broadly understood as financing as well as related institutional and market arrangements that contribute to the achievement of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, through supporting directly and indirectly the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals.The EBA will develop reports, guidelines, and technical standards, and incorporate ESG consideration in its risk analysis work following the general mandate included in the EBA Regulation and specific mandates provided in the sectoral legislation outlined above.

BothRTS and the statement were developed to facilitate further international consistency in the implementation of the global framework agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).First of all, in view of the clarifications and changes of the global framework made over the past months by the BCBS and IOSCO, the report and related RTS clarify the expectations in relation to the threshold above which initial margin is expected to be exchanged, as well as introduce a further phase-in of one year for the smaller counterparties in scope for the initial margin requirements. Secondly, taking into account the progress made globally towards the implementation of the international framework as well as the risks that the BCBS and IOSCO framework was developed to address, a few amendments have been included in relation to the treatment of physically settled FX forward and swap contracts, intragroup contracts and equity option contracts. Lastly, the statement clarifies the view of the ESAs that amendments made to outstanding uncleared OTC derivative contracts for the sole purpose of introducing such fall-backs should not create new obligations on these legacy contracts.Legal basis, background and next stepsThe ESAs\u2019 RTS and the statement were developed in order to facilitate further international consistency in the implementation of the global framework agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).The ESAs have developed the RTS under Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR).The ESAs have now submitted the draft RTS to the Commission for endorsement in the form of a Commission Delegated Regulation, i.e. a legally binding instrument applicable in all Member States of the European Union. Following the endorsement, they are then subject to non-objection by the European Parliament and the Council.The ESAs cannot disapply EU law. However, in view of the remaining steps mentioned above that the draft RTS need to go through before being finalised and entering into force, and in light of some of the soon approaching deadlines, with regards to the bilateral margin requirements and the treatment of physically settled FX forward and swap contracts, intragroup contracts, equity option contracts and the implementation of the last phase of the initial margin requirements as proposed in the draft RTS, the ESAs expect competent authorities to apply the EU framework in a risk-based and proportionate manner until the amended RTS enter into force.Lastly, with regards to the statement in relation to fall-backs, the ESAs believe it useful to ensure legal certainty on this issue, in case or to the extent this is not already provided in some jurisdictions. While, neither the ESAs nor competent authorities possess any formal power to disapply directly applicable EU legal text, the ESAs are in contact with the co-legislators to see how a legislative change could be achieved to ensure this legal certainty.

Today\u2019s publication includes an assessment of the impact of the revisions to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and market risk frameworks, and the corresponding policy recommendations. It also provides a macroeconomic impact assessment of the full Basel III package. When accounting for the 2019 FRTB standards, the impact assessment shows that the full implementation of Basel III, under conservative assumptions, will increase the current minimum capital requirement (MRC) by 23.6% on average. This impact is lower than the 24.4% originally estimated in the August 2019 report, and would imply an aggregate shortfall in total capital of EUR 124.8 billion. The macroeconomic impact assessment shows that the implementation of Basel III will have net benefits for the economy of the European Union. The EBA reaffirms its support for a full implementation of the final Basel III standards in the EU.Key findings of the quantitative analysisConsidering the 2019 FRTB standards, the revised weighted average increase in the current MRC is 23.6% for the entire sample, under conservative assumptions. The lower impact compared to the August 2019 Report (24.4%) is due to a reduction in the impact of market risk (2.2% compared to 2.5%) and the lower impact of the output floor (8.6%, compared to 9.1%). This reduction is observed almost entirely among large banks. The estimated total capital shortfall is about EUR 124.8 billion (EUR 83.0 billion in terms of CET1), down from the EUR 135.1 billion shortfall in total capital (EUR 91.1 billion in CET1) estimated in the August 2019 report.\u00a0Table\u00a01\u00a0Percentage change in T1 MRC (relative to current T1 MRC), by size\u00a0\u2206 SA\u2206 IRB\u2206 CCP\u2206 SEC\u2206 MKT\u2206 OP\u2206 CVA\u2206 LR\u2206 OF\u2206 TotalAll banks2.72.70.10.62.23.33.9-0.58.623.6Large2.32.80.10.72.23.44.1-0.59.024.1of which: G-SIIs1.73.5-0.11.23.95.55.10.06.427.2of which: O-SIIs2.31.70.20.31.22.13.7-0.512.023.0Medium9.70.10.00.00.90.30.5-1.10.911.3Small10.70.00.2-1.90.0-3.70.3-0.10.05.5\u00a0Table\u00a02\u00a0Capital ratios and shortfalls, by size\u00a0CET1 capitalTier 1 capitalTotal capital\u00a0Current ratio (%)Revised ratio (%)Shortfall (EUR billion)Current ratio (%)Revised ratio (%)Shortfall (EUR billion)Current ratio (%)Revised ratio (%)Shortfall (EUR billion)All banks14.411.683.015.312.4119.017.914.4124.8Large14.211.482.915.212.2118.217.814.3123.8of which: G-SIIs12.710.146.813.810.962.616.212.875.3of which: O-SIIs15.412.532.216.313.349.519.215.641.1Medium17.315.20.117.515.40.818.916.60.9Small17.016.00.017.216.10.018.317.10.1\u00a0These results reported in Tables 1 and 2 do not take into account the targeted revisions to the CVA framework proposed by the Basel Committee in November 2019, which are expected to further reduce the overall impact. Under a scenario in which the SA-CVA and BA-CVA capital requirements are recalibrated downwards by 10%, the impact on CVA will move from 3.9% to 3.4% (reducing the total impact from 23.6% to 23.1%). Since the impact is broadly linear, a 20% reduction (the lower bound proposed by BCBS) would produce impacts of 2.9%.Key findings of the macroeconomic impact assessmentThe assessment of the macroeconomic costs and benefits of the finalisation of the Basel III framework was carried out in cooperation with the ECB.The results show that the implementation of the Basel reforms will result in modest transitional costs, which fade over time. The long-term benefits are substantial and outweigh the modest transitory costs. The reform would mitigate the severity of future economic downturns through a reduction in both probability and intensity of future banking crises, leading to sizable long-term net benefits of around 0.6 percent of annual GDP level.Key policy recommendationsThe EBA also put forward detailed policy recommendations in the areas of CVA and market risk. Overall, it should be recalled that the EBA continues to support the full implementation of the final Basel III standards, which will contribute to the credibility of the EU banking sector and ensure a well-functioning global banking market. These reforms will increase financial stability, while at the same time allowing the continued use of risk-sensitive approaches.In the area of CVA risk the EBA recommends that:As the CVA risk generated by the CVA exemptions can be substantial, it should be captured prudentially. This will allow alignment with international standards on CVA risk and adherence to a risk-based capital requirements framework.The use of the simplified treatment for CVA risk should be based on the proportionality framework for counterparty credit risk (CCR) already envisaged in the CRR2, and its use should be allowed to firms eligible to employ the simplified SA-CCR under the CRR2.In the area of market risk, the EBA recommendations aim to ensure a smooth and consistent implementation of the revised market risk framework in the EU and, therefore, focus on issues identified in the market risk standards as implemented in the CRR/CRR2. In particular, they clarify the treatment for unrated covered bonds under the FRTB-SA, and support the use of the recalibrated (Basel II) standardised approach as a simplified approach for institutions not subject to the FRTB reporting requirement under the CRR2.\u00a0Notes to editorsUnlike the results published in the August 2019 report, which were based on the 2016 FRTB standards, the analysis published today accounts for the 2019 FRTB standards. Already in 2016, the EBA provided its advice on the implementation of the FRTB in the EU. The policy recommendations put forward today, therefore, build on the CRR2 implementation of the FRTB in the EU.The analysis includes Pillar 2 requirements and the full set of combined buffer requirements in the calculation of banks' minimum required capital and assumes that these requirements remain at current levels. Therefore, it cannot be directly compared to the figures the EBA publishes periodically in the context of regular Basel III monitoring exercises (e.g. latest one in October 2019) which limit the impact analysis to Pillar 1 minimum requirements and specific buffer requirements (capital conservation buffer and G-SII buffer where applicable).These results should also be read in conjunction with a set of conservative assumptions, in particular the assessment does not consider any adjustments in banks\u2019 balance sheets nor authorities\u2019 response to the implementation of Basel III.

The Report is accompanied by the publication of the 2019 EU-wide transparency exercise, which provides detailed information, in a comparable and accessible format, for 131 banks across the EU. Overall, EU banks\u2019 solvency ratios remained stable, while the NPL ratio further contracted.

Since 2014, commercial real estate, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) and consumer credit exposures have been the segments with the highest growth rates. This focus on riskier segments shows banks\u2019 search for yield in an environment of low interest rates and shrinking margins.Asset quality has continued to improve, although at a slower pace. The NPL ratio declined from 3.6\u00a0% in June 2018 to 3\u00a0% in 2019. However, the focus on riskier exposures over the past few years combined with a weakening macroeconomic outlook might change this trend. Responses to the EBA\u2019s Risk Assessment Questionnaire (RAQ) also show that an increasing share of banks expect a deterioration of asset quality for most of the loan segments. These include portfolios, which they also aim to expand, like SME and consumer credit financing.Funding conditions have improved, supported by benign financial markets. Banks should take advantage of the current low interest rate environment to build up their MREL buffers. With an increasing number of banks charging or planning to charge negative interest rates to corporate and household deposits, the effects of such measures on the deposit base remain to be seen.After material progress over the past few years, capital ratios remained broadly unchanged year on year (YoY). As of June 2019, the CET1 ratio stood at 14.4\u00a0% (14.3 % in June 2018) on a fully loaded basis. A parallel increase in risk-weighted assets (RWAs) (2.5\u00a0% YoY) and CET1 (3\u00a0% YoY) was observed in the last year. Credit risk, which makes up 80\u00a0% of total RWA, has increased by roughly 2.5\u00a0%, which is lower than the growth in total assets (3\u00a0%) and total loans (3.5\u00a0%). Such developments indicate that credit RWAs are driven not only by trends in banks\u2019 assets, but also by changes in the composition of banks\u2019 exposures and risk parameters.Profitability remains at low levels. The RoE for EU banks decreased slightly from 7.2\u00a0% to 7\u00a0% in 2019. The deteriorating macroeconomic environment along with low interest rates and intense competition not only from banks, but also from financial technology (FinTech) firms and other financial players, is expected to add further pressure to bank profitability. In this challenging environment, the streamlining of operating expenses is presumably the main area to improve profitability.Technology risks and increasing money laundering/terrorist financing (ML/TF) cases maintain operational risk high. Cyberattacks and data breaches represent major concerns for banks. In addition, the occurrence of ML/TF scandals may imply corresponding legal and reputational costs.

These Guidelines will enter into force on 30 June 2020.\u00a0The increasing digitalisation in the financial sector and the growing interconnectedness across financial institutions and third parties make financial institutions\u2019 operations vulnerable to internal and external ICT and security risks that can potentially compromise their viability.

These draft ITS follow an integrated approach and, in the case of disclosures, are aligned with the Basel Pillar 3 standards. By integrating disclosures and reporting, the EBA seeks to maximise efficiency by institutions, and to facilitate the use of information by authorities and market participants. The consultation runs until 22 February 2020. The draft ITS include proposals for templates and tables implementing the TLAC/MREL disclosure and reporting requirements. In addition to the draft ITS, the consultation paper includes two recommended reporting templates covering the forecast of MREL and TLAC positions and funding structures, and a file mapping disclosure and reporting requirements. The integrated approach aims to optimise efficiency by institutions when complying with their disclosure and reporting obligations, to facilitate the use of information by authorities and market participants, and to promote market discipline. For this purpose: MREL and TLAC are integrated for both the reporting and the disclosure templates; Reporting and disclosure requirements are enshrined in a single set of ITS; Disclosure of quantitative information is integrated with supervisory reporting data, and a mapping between both is provided; TLAC disclosure templates have been aligned with the Basel Pillar 3 standards.

These mandates are mainly focused in the areas of\u00a0 governance and remuneration, large exposures, resolution as well as reporting and disclosure. Besides clarifying the sequencing of mandates and the rationale behind their prioritisation, the roadmaps aim\u00a0at providing a preliminary understanding of the mandates combined with some policy guidance. Through this work, the EBA will contribute to making the European Single Rulebook more comprehensive, proportionate and apt to reflect developments in the banking sector.The Risk Reduction Package allocates to the EBA more than 100 new mandates under the revised Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V), Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR II), Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD II). Most of the mandates aim at completing and updating the Single Rulebook as well at monitoring regulatory practices within the Single Market to ensure the effective and consistent implementation of such rules.In the area of governance, the EBA will contribute to optimising the existing framework with an emphasis on the finalisation of the remuneration deliverables. In the area of large exposures, the EBA\u2019s priority will be to complete the framework where currently no EBA work exists, namely for determining exposures arising from derivatives. In the area of Pillar 2, the EBA will consider how to make the Pillar 2 framework fit for purpose in view of ongoing and new challenges. In particular, proportionality will be strengthened, and the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) and sustainable finance dimensions will be clarified together with Pillar 2 capital add-ons. On resolution, the EBA\u2019s work aims at facilitating effective resolution planning and preparedness, such as on MREL calibration and monitoring In the area of supervisory reporting, the EBA aims at achieving an efficient reporting framework with enhanced proportionality.

Total non-performing loans (NPLs) decreased from over EUR 1.15 trillion in June 2015 (6% as a percentage of total loans) to EUR 636 billion as of June 2019. The NPL ratio declined to 3%, the lowest ratio since the EBA introduced a harmonised definition of NPLs across European countries. The average coverage ratio slightly increased from 43.6% to 44.9% over the same period.The Report identifies three pillars that determined the overall reduction in NPLs: supervisory attention and political determination to address the NPL issue effectively, coupled by banks\u2019 efforts to enhance their NPL management capabilities. The reduction was also helped by a positive economic growth, low interest rates and decreasing unemployment. Countries with high NPL ratios have led the de-risking process of banks\u2019 balance sheets.Despite the significant improvement, dispersion of NPL ratios across countries remains wide. As of June 2019, Greece reported the highest NPL ratio (39.2%), followed by Cyprus (21.5%), while five additional countries had a NPL ratio above 5%. In comparison, in June 2015, 17 countries reported NPL ratio above 5% of which 10 countries had a double-digit ratio. Countries with high NPL ratios have larger share in past-due buckets of 1 year and more. These older NPLs are harder to cure, considerably devalued and pose a significant risk to those banks that have an increased share of assets on their balance sheets.The differences in the speed of the recovery procedures, also due to less efficient legal frameworks and thin secondary markets for NPLs, remain the most significant impediments to the further offloading of NPLs. There are significant ongoing initiatives that aim to further boost the reduction of legacy assets both at European level and in specific countries. However, in light of weakening economic conditions, all banks should closely monitor the asset quality to identify any possible deterioration, especially in riskier segments, and continue actively managing the NPLs in their balance sheets.Notes to editors\u00a0This is the second thematic Report on NPLs, following the one published in July 2016.\u00a0 This Report is based on supervisory data of asset quality metrics, and aims at updating on the progress made so far in addressing NPLs in Europe. It also takes stock of ongoing initiatives to tackle the NPL issue both at EU level and at member state level, identifies challenges to tackle the remaining NPL stock and indicates possible areas where further action is needed.The report is accompanied by a data visualisation tool that provides a country-by-country analysis of key asset quality metrics.

Similar to the 2018 exercise, the 2020 EU-wide stress test is a bottom-up exercise with constraints, including a static balance sheet assumption. The exercise is primarily focused on the assessment of the impact of risk drivers on the solvency of banks. Banks are required to stress a common set of risks (credit risk \u2013 including securitisations \u2013 market risk and counterparty credit risk, and operational risk \u2013 including conduct risk). In addition, banks are requested to project the impact of the scenarios on net interest income and to stress P&L and capital items not covered by other risk types.A draft version of the stress test templates is also published along with a template guidance that contains instructions on how to populate them.

The Opinion focuses on the payouts by deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) and proposes a number of changes to the EU legal framework, aimed at strengthening depositor protection, improving depositor information, enhancing financial stability and reinforcing operational effectiveness of DGSs.In its Opinion, the EBA assesses nine different topics related to DGS payouts and sets out 30 proposals on how to improve the current EU legal framework. The proposals include changes in relation to cases where depositors have lost access to their funds but payouts have not started, and cases where there are money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) concerns. The Opinion also proposes improvements to the treatment of specific situations, such as the treatment of beneficiary accounts and depositors temporarily holding deposits above the coverage level or with banks headquartered in another EU Member State.More specifically, based on recent real-life cases, the Opinion proposes changes aimed at ensuring that depositors are not unduly left without access to their funds when the decision \u00a0that deposits have become unavailable has not (yet) been made by the authorities. The Opinion proposes that, in such instances, depositors should have access to an appropriate daily amount from their deposits. Similarly, the EBA proposes that the EU framework could benefit from more clarity on DGS payouts where there are ML/TF concerns, including the introduction of powers necessary to suspend payouts to depositors suspected of ML/TF. The Opinion also proposes how cooperation between DGSs and AML authorities can be improved and highlights the importance of informing depositors in such instances. Given the complexity of such cases, the EBA is of the view that further analysis is needed, both from the DGS and the AML perspective.Finally, throughout the Opinion, the EBA underlines the importance of enhancing depositor protection, and clearly informing depositors about the most relevant features of such protection, in normal times, as well as during a DGS payout. In this respect, the EBA proposes, for example, that depositors should be clearly informed about their rights in relation to temporary high balances, and the possibility that their deposits would be set-off against their liabilities that have fallen due before their deposits had became unavailable. The EBA also proposes that depositors should have sufficient time to claim their funds after a bank failure.Legal basis, background and next stepsArticle 19(6) DGSD requires the EBA to support the EU Commission in its development of a report on the progress towards the implementation of the DGSD. This Opinion is the second part of the EBA\u2019s fulfilment of this mandate, which should be read alongside two other Opinions \u2013 on eligibility of deposits, coverage level and cooperation between DGSs, and on DGS funding and uses of DGS funds. This Opinion follows the first one on the eligibility of deposits, coverage level and cooperation between DGSs, which was published in August 2019. The third and final EBA opinion on DGS funding and uses of DGS funds, will be published in early 2020.The EBA invites the Commission to consider the proposals outlined in the Opinion when preparing a report on the implementation of the DGSD to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.

Developed under the EBA\u2019s FinTech Roadmap, this Report calls on the European Commission to facilitate cross-border access, including the update of interpretative communications on the cross-border provision of services and further harmonisation of consumer protection, conduct of business and AML/CFT requirements, in order to facilitate the scaling up of activity cross-border. Digital solutions can increase choice by enabling consumers access to a wider population of providers of financial services. However, the full potential of these solutions has not yet been achieved in the EU, in part due to divergences in regulatory requirements and supervisory practices across the Member States. Identifying and resolving these issues is a necessary step to addressing barriers to market entry, supporting the scaling up of financial services across the EU, and improving the competitiveness of the EU Single Market.The first important challenge is the identification of when a digital activity is to be regarded as a cross-border provision of services. Although this is a crucial element in determining which regulatory and supervisory frameworks apply, currently, competent authorities and firms lack clear guidance on how to classify cross-border activity under the freedom to provide services or right of establishment. The second challenge stems from areas of EU law that are not fully harmonised or are not yet covered by EU law. In particular, the EBA identifies issues related to authorisations and licencing, consumer protection, conduct of business requirements and anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT). Left unaddressed these issues may impede institutions and other FinTech firms from providing banking and payments services cross-border within the EU. Therefore, the EBA recommends the European Commission take action, including the update of its interpretative communications to support the identification of cross-border services taking account of the digitisation of financial services and the development of legislative proposals to further harmonise requirements relating to consumer protection, conduct of business and AML/CFT. Further information can be found in the report and\u00a0\u2018Q&A\u2019.Legal basis and backgroundThe Report has been prepared pursuant to Article 9(4) of the EBA's Founding Regulation which mandates the EBA to establish a Committee on financial innovation \u2018which brings together all relevant competent national and supervisory authorities with a view to achieving a coordinated approach to the regulatory and supervisory treatment of new or innovative financial activities and providing advice for the Authority to present to the European Parliament, Council and the European Commission'.In accordance with the March 2018 European Commission FinTech Action Plan and the EBA FinTech Roadmap, the EBA has been carrying out work to assess potential issues that firms, particularly those using digital means, may face when seeking to provide services cross-border.

The recommendations relate primarily to the scope and consistency of disclosure rules, the timing of disclosure, the presentation format and accessibility of information. In addition, they cover advertisements, pre-contractual information, rights of withdrawal, complaints handling and post sale information.In order for consumers to make informed decisions about their financial products and services, they should have access to high-quality information, which should be provided at the appropriate time, via suitable means, and explaining the features and costs across the lifetime of the service.In the EU, relevant requirements for the marketing of services that are bought at a distance are set out in the Distance Marketing of Financial Services Directive (2002/65/EC, DMFSD).

Securitisations can play an instrumental role in reducing NPE stocks in credit institutions\u2019 balance sheets but such a role may be hindered by certain provisions in the EU law securitisation framework. This Opinion recommends various amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) as well as to the Securitisation Regulation to remove the identified constraints. The Opinion is addressed at the European Commission and contributes to the objectives of the Council of the EU\u2019s \u201cAction plan to tackle non-performing loans in Europe\u201d. A copy of the Opinion has been sent to the European Parliament and the Council.NPE securitisations are transactions backed by pools comprised exclusively or almost exclusively of NPE at the time of inception. Though structurally similar to other securitisations, the underlying assets have distinctive features that set NPE securitisations apart from those from an economic substance perspective, namely due to the large discount on their nominal value and their specific underlying risks.\u00a0 The Opinion explains that the regulatory framework imposes certain constraints on credit institutions using securitisation technology to dispose of NPE holdings, namely:Very high capital requirements on investor credit institutions under the CRR: the pre-eminent securitisation capital methods (the SEC-IRBA and the SEC-SA) and the look-through approach lead to disproportionately high capital charges on NPE securitisation positions when compared to relevant benchmarks and, as a result, tend to overstate the actual risk embedded in the portfolio;Compliance challenges as regards certain risk retention and due diligence requirements under the Securitisation Regulation. The Opinion recommends that the Commission consider a number of targeted amendments to the CRR and the Securitisation Regulation to remove these constraints whilst maintaining the integrity of the prudential framework. The recommendations should be viewed as preliminary and subject to additional analytical work, namely the amendments to the CRR that may require limited calibration. Furthermore, the potential amendments to the CRR should be, to the extent possible, consistent with comparable international standards.\u00a0\u00a0 Legal basisThe Opinion has been drafted in accordance with Article 34(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, by virtue of which the Authority may, on its own initiative, provide opinions to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on all issues related to its area of competence.

The Opinion sets the deadline to 31 December 2020 and prescribes the expected actions to be taken during the migration period.Today's Opinion also recommends national competent authorities (NCAs) to take a consistent approach toward the SCA migration period across the EU and to require their respective payment service providers (PSPs) to carry out the actions set out in the Opinion.In addition, the Opinion recommends that, where required, NCAs communicate to PSPs in their jurisdiction that the supervisory flexibility they have exercised does not represent a delay in the application date of the SCA requirements in PSD2 and the EBA's Technical Standards. Rather, it means that NCAs will focus on monitoring migration plans instead of pursuing immediate enforcement actions against PSPs that are not compliant with the SCA requirements.Furthermore, the EBA notes that consumers will be protected against fraud as required by the law and NCAs should, therefore, communicate to their PSPs that the liability regime under Article 74 of the PSD2 applies and that issuing and acquiring PSPs are still liable for unauthorised payment transactions.BackgroundToday's Opinion is a follow-up to the Opinion on the elements of strong customer authentication under PSD2 (EBA-Op-2019-06) that the EBA published in June 2019.

This ambitious proposal seeks to optimise the EBA Pillar 3 policy framework by moving from a silo based approach, with different disclosure policy products, to an all-inclusive ITS. It also implements regulatory changes introduced by the CRR2 and aligns the disclosure framework with international standards.The amending regulation (EU) No 2019/876 (\u2018CRR2') introduced new disclosure requirements for institutions, and a mandate for the EBA to implement them in a way that conveys sufficiently comprehensive and comparable information for market participants to assess the risk profiles of institutions (Article 434a of the CRR2). The new ITS aim to reinforce market discipline, by increasing consistency and comparability of institutions' public disclosures, and to implement the CRR2 regulatory changes in alignment with the revised Basel Pillar 3 standards.The all-inclusive ITS provide a complete Pillar 3 disclosure framework that seeks to facilitate its implementation by institutions and to improve clarity for users of information. The disclosure ITS have been developed fostering consistency with supervisory reporting, and a mapping between quantitative disclosure data and reporting is provided in order to facilitate compliance by institutions. A parallel consultation regarding the draft ITS on supervisory reporting was also launched today.This consultation paper is the first one of the deliverables that will be presented in a forthcoming EBA roadmap on institutions' Pillar 3 disclosures. That roadmap, which will be published in Q4 2019, provides an overview of the EBA Pillar 3 strategy, deliverables and timeline for the implementation of all the disclosure requirements included in the CRR2/BRRD2, including ESG risks and climate change related information, as well as the disclosure requirements for investment firms under the IFR.Consultation processResponses to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

The deadline for the submission of comments is 16 January 2020.A public hearing on this consultation will take place at the EBA premises on 2 December, from 14:00 to 16:00 CET time.Legal basis and next stepsThese draft ITS have been developed in accordance with Article 434a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 which mandates the EBA to develop draft implementing technical standards specifying uniform disclosure formats, and associated instructions in accordance with which the disclosures required under Titles II and III shall be made. The same mandate specifies that those uniform disclosure formats shall convey sufficiently comprehensive and comparable information for users of that information to assess the risk profiles of institutions and their degree of compliance with the requirements laid down in Parts One to Seven. To facilitate the comparability of information, the implementing technical standards shall seek to maintain consistency of disclosure formats with international standards on disclosures.The EBA expects to submit these revised draft ITS to the European Commission in June 2020.

In particular, in 2019, there were two amendments to the CRR affecting supervisory reporting:The amending Regulation (EU) 2019/876 (\u2018CRR2'), which implements a number key measures such as liquidity, leverage and large exposures;The amending Regulation (EU) 2019/630 (\u2018Backstop Regulation'), which sets minimum loss coverage for future non-performing exposures (NPEs).This consultation paper proposes changes to different areas of reporting, including own funds, credit risk, counterparty credit risk, large exposures, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio and FINREP. The review of the reporting framework is designed to replace the Commission's Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and has been used as an opportunity to improve the consistency between the reporting and disclosure requirements, with a view to facilitate institutions' compliance with both requirements. A parallel consultation regarding the draft ITS on public disclosures by institutions was also launched today.This consultation paper is the first one of the deliverables that will be presented in a forthcoming roadmap \u2018EBA work to improve the reporting in the EU', which describes the EBA's strategy to implement the CRR2/CRD5, the BRRD2 and the IFR mandates in the reporting framework and it will be published in Q4 2019.

These Guidelines aim at setting a regulatory framework on Structural FX to address the observed diversity in its application across the EU. In particular, the guidelines identify criteria to assist Competent Authorities in their assessment of the structural nature of a foreign-exchange position and whether such position has been deliberately taken for hedging the capital ratio. The consultation runs until 17 January 2020.The concept and specific application of the Structural FX provision, as laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), appears to be subject to several interpretations, across both supervisory authorities and institutions. As a result, the application of this provision can have significant impacts on capital requirements. Accordingly, the EBA is of the view that a more harmonised application and enforcement of this provision is necessary and can be achieved thanks to these Guidelines.This consultation paper is setting objective criteria that Competent Authorities should consider for the purpose of assessing whether the conditions set out in article 352(2) of the CRR for receiving the permission to exclude a foreign-exchange position from the net open position in the foreign currency are met. These guidelines introduce for the first time a detailed regulatory framework around the Structural FX provision and several questions have been included as part of the consultation process to gather feedback around the proposed provisions.Consultation processComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

Drawing on data and information provided by national anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) competent authorities (CAs), the ESAs found that the monitoring of transactions and suspicious transactions reporting still raise concerns, particularly in sectors where a financial institution's business model is based on frequent transactions. This Opinion contributes to strengthening the EU's AML and CFT efforts. The ESAs are concerned about weaknesses in the control frameworks put in place by financial institutions, particularly for transaction monitoring and suspicious transactions reporting, in sectors with high volumes of transactions. \u00a0Equally, it appears that the development of adequate business-wide and customer risk assessments is still a challenge for financial institutions across different sectors and is an areas that would benefit from more guidance from CAs.Furthermore, in addition to divergences in the national transposition of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD4), as identified in the first Joint Opinion published in 2017, today's Opinion identifies divergences between certain provisions in the AMLD4 and other EU legal acts, particularly those related to authorisations, fitness and propriety and assessments of qualifying holdings. Some of these concerns have already been addressed through recent revisions in legal frameworks like the Capital Requirements Directive (CRDV).The ESAs acknowledge that the use of new technologies may offer opportunities to better fight financial crime, however, this Opinion also confirms that the increasing use of new technologies by credit and financial institutions may give rise to ML/TF risks if vulnerabilities are not understood and mitigated. Equally, the rapid spread of virtual currencies is also an area of growing concern for the ESAs, as they often give rise to heightened ML/TF risks due to the absence of a common regulatory regime and the anonymity associated with them.\u00a0To tackle these risks and concerns effectively, the ESAs consider that CAs \u00a0must play a more active role and enhance their engagement with the private sector to develop a better understanding of new technologies, products and services available to credit and financial institutions. CAs should also consider whether they have a sufficient understanding of risks and controls in those sectors where they have carried out only limited assessments and may need to review their supervisory approach.As a complement to this Opinion, the ESAs have developed an interactive tool, which gives European citizens, CAs and credit and financial institutions a snapshot of all ML/TF risks covered in the Joint Opinion.

Capital ratios have remained broadly stable and banks' asset quality has further improved. However, low profitability keeps on being a key challenge for the sector. \tFully loaded CET1 ratios remained at 14.4%, in line the previous quarters. The CET1 ratio on a transitional basis was 14.6%, 10bps below Q1, mainly as a result of one-off changes in the reporting sample. While the average capital ratios remained broadly unchanged, banks on the lower end of the distribution further increased capital ratios. \tThe ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) further declined to 3.0% from 3.1% in the previous quarter. However, while the Q1 decrease of the NPL ratio was mainly supported by an increase of total loans, the contraction in Q2 was driven by declining NPLs. Similar to the NPL ratio, also the shares of Stage 2 and Stage 3 loans declined in Q2 2019. \tReturn on equity (RoE) stood at 7.0%, which is 20bps above Q1 this year, but lower than one year ago. Its dispersion narrowed, with Q2 2019 being the first quarter in which the 5th percentile was above zero. Total net operating income continued its rising trend in the second quarter, supported by net interest as well as net fee and commission income. The cost to income ratio (CIR) remained high at 64.1%. \tLooking forward, rising economic and political uncertainty might negatively affect the EU banking sector. The challenge of low profitability might aggravate amid potentially increasing impairments and provisioning needs. Also new lending volumes might suffer from a worsening in the general economic conditions and from a deterioration of the asset quality.

In December 2018, the average LCR was 149%. The aggregate gross shortfall amounted to EUR 15.7 billion and it is entirely attributed \u00a0to four banks that monetised their liquidity buffers during times of stress. An in-depth analysis of potential currency mismatches in LCR levels suggests that banks tend to hold significantly lower liquidity buffers in some foreign currencies, in particular US dollar and GBP. Insome cases LCR ratios in USD or GBP are well below 100%.\u00a0The analysis of the impact of the LCR on lending does not provide clear empirical evidence of this relationship. Notes to the editorsThe Basel III monitoring report assesses the impact on EU banks of the final revisions of credit risk, split into four sub-categories, operational risk, and leverage ratio frameworks, as well as of the introduction of the aggregate output floor. It also quantifies the impact of the credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and the new standards for market risk (FRTB).\u00a0The cumulative impact analysis of the Basel III monitoring exercise report uses a total sample of 113 banks.The current report provides a high-level assessment of the impact of the final Basel III reforms on Pillar 1 Tier 1 MRC and capital shortfalls.

Therefore, the ESAs call for the following policy actions by European and national competent authorities (NCAs) as well as financial institutions: Contingency planning: Financial institutions and supervisors should continue their work on contingency planning and assurance of business continuity in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Considering the variety of measures undertaken by the ESAs and national supervisory authorities and other competent authorities, the EU financial sector should be well informed and prepared to manage risks from a micro-perspective. The ESA's will also continue to closely monitor ongoing political and market developments and consider the need for further communications on that basis. \"Low-for-long\" scenario: Supervisors and financial institutions should continue taking into account a \"low-for-long\" interest rate scenario and associated risks. Low interest rates are an important driver of low bank profitability and remain the main risk for the insurance and pension fund sectors. They contribute to the further build-up of valuation risks in securities markets as well as to a move into less liquid and more leveraged investments through search-for-yield strategies. On the investment fund side, a convergent application of the rules on liquidity management and (for UCITS) eligible assets as well as a consistent use of stress testing will be important supervisory tools. Bank profitability: There is a need to further address unprofitable banks and their business models in order to increase the resilience of institutions to a more challenging economic environment. Further investments into financial technologies and exploring opportunities for bank sector consolidation are among responses to low profitability. Transparency and the consistent application of common prudential requirements and supervisory rules across jurisdictions are preconditions, which could contribute to the use of opportunities cross border consolidation, may offer. Leveraged lending market: Risks related to the leveraged loan market and Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) in the financial sector should be further explored and identified. There is a lack of clarity about the total volume of leveraged loans outstanding and about the ultimate holders of risks of many CLO tranches. Supervisors have raised concerns about a possible underpricing of risks. Sustainable finance and ESG risks: Supervisory authorities and financial institutions should continue their work on identifying exposures to climate related risks and facilitate access of investors to sustainable assets. Scenario analysis and stress testing are important tools that can be implemented by supervisors with a goal to incorporate sustainability considerations into risk assessment. Financial institutions should incorporate climate risk and other ESG factors into their risk management framework and should play a stewardship role by taking into account the impact of their activities on ESG factors. Going forward, the ESAs should take a proactive stance in fulfilling mandates on sustainable finance, including on how ESG considerations can be incorporated into the regulatory and supervisory framework of EU financial institutions. Background \tThe Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering.

The aim of the clarification is to preserve a consistent and high quality capital base for EU institutions under the CRR. \tWhen the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) entered into force, grandfathering provisions were introduced. In order to ensure that institutions had sufficient time to meet the requirements set out by the new definition of own funds, certain capital instruments that, at that time, did not comply with the new definition of own funds were grandfathered for a transition period with the objective of phasing them out from own funds. \tThe beneficial treatment provided by the grandfathering provisions will come to an end on 31 December 2021. In line with its mandate to monitor the quality of own funds and eligible liabilities instruments issued by institutions across the Union, the EBA intends to provide clarity on the appropriate end-treatment to ensure a high quality of capital for EU institutions and a consistent application of rules and practices. \tWhile reflecting on this issue, the EBA will also clarify the interaction with the new grandfathering provisions introduced by the recent Banking Package and the corresponding amendments to the CRR and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), where relevant for own funds instruments and eligible liabilities. \tIn developing its work, the EBA will ensure an appropriate interaction with all concerned stakeholders. In the meantime, institutions are encouraged to engage with their respective competent authorities with regard to the magnitude and intended future treatment of their outstanding \u2018legacy' instruments in the context of the supervisory dialogue on their capital planning. \tThe EBA aims at communicating on the end-treatment of the \u2018legacy' grandfathered instruments by mid-2020 so that institutions can adequately prepare for the end of the grandfathering period. \tLegal basis and background \tArticle 484 of the CRR defines the eligibility for grandfathering of items that qualified as own funds under national transposition measures for Directive 2006/48/EC. Article 486 specifies the limits for the grandfathering of items within Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 items until 31 December 2021, including the possibility for competent authorities to implement shorter grandfathering periods. \tPursuant to Article 80 of the CRR (as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876) on the continuing review of the quality of own funds and eligible liabilities instruments, the \u2018EBA shall monitor the quality of own funds and eligible liabilities instruments issued by institutions across the Union and shall notify the Commission immediately where there is significant evidence that those instruments do not meet the respective eligibility criteria set out in this Regulation'.

The results of the funding plans assessment show that banks plan to increase debt issuances over the next 3 years, in particular unsecured debt instruments. The asset encumbrance report shows a stability of the overall weighted average asset encumbrance ratio in 2018, which is positive for the funding structure of the banking sector. \t160 banks submitted their plans for funding over a forecast period of three years (2019 to 2021). According to the plans, total assets are projected to grow, on average, by 6.1% by 2021. The main drivers for asset growth are loans to households and to non-financial corporates. \tOver the forecast period, banks plan to increase client deposits and to issue more debt instruments. In particular, unsecured debt issuances are expected to increase significantly over the 3-year forecast period. The projected data shows a concentration of debt issuances in 2020 and 2021. Most likely, these issuances are driven by the conjunction of the maturities of central bank funding and the recently endorsed revised Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD 2), which requires greater levels of subordination. \tData also shows that the spread between interest rates for client deposits and for loans to clients declined in 2018. For the year 2019, however, most banks expect the spread decline to be less severe or to increase slightly. As regards market-based funding, banks assume that the cost of issuing debt securities will increase in 2019, reversing a downward trend observed over the last three years. Asset encumbrance remains stable in 2018 \tThe asset encumbrance report shows that in December 2018 the overall weighted average asset encumbrance ratio stood at 27.9%, unchanged compared to December 2017. The stability of asset encumbrance is a positive sign for the funding structure of the banking sector. Nevertheless, the report shows a wide dispersion in the ratio, across both institutions and countries. \tRepo financing remains the most important source of asset encumbrance in the EU, increasing its share to 30% from 27% in December 2017. The share of covered bonds (17%) and central bank funding (10%) as sources of asset encumbrance slightly decreased compared to last year.

This work responds to a Commission's call for advice. The impact assessment shows that the full implementation of Basel III, under conservative assumptions, will increase the minimum capital requirement (MRC) by 24.4% on average. This increase in capital requirements will imply an aggregate shortfall in total capital of about EUR 135.1 billion (EUR 91.1 billion in terms of common equity tier 1, CET1). The majority of the capital impact occurs in large globally active banks, while the impact on medium-sized banks is limited to 11.3% in terms of MRC, leading to a shortfall of EUR 0.9 billion, and on small banks to 5.5% MRC with a EUR 0.1 billion shortfall. The EBA supports the full implementation of the final Basel III standards, which will contribute to the credibility of the EU banking sector and ensure a well-functioning global banking market. The EBA welcomes the improvements introduced in the final Basel III package. These include the introduction of a higher degree of risk sensitivity in the standardised approaches to measure credit and operational risks, and constraints to internal modelling by banks where undue variability of model outcomes was observed in the past. Overall, these reforms will increase financial stability, while at the same time allowing the continued use of risk-sensitive approaches.The results of the quantitative analysis show that the impact of the full implementation of Basel III, including the discontinuation of EU-specific current policies such as the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) supporting factor and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) exemptions, is diverse across banks. The weighted average increase in MRC is 24.4% for the entire sample, under conservative assumptions (table 1). However, the impact differs significantly across the sample.\u00a0 For half of the banks in the sample, the impact is less than 10.6%, and it is negative for a quarter of the sample. The MRC increase for small banks is limited to 5.5%. The estimated total capital shortfall is about EUR 135.1 billion (EUR 91.1 billion in terms of CET1), and it is observed almost entirely among large banks (table 2). This estimated shortfall would reduce to EUR 58.7 billion if banks were to retain profits (based on 2014-18 data) throughout the transition period.\u00a0\u00a0Table 1 Percentage change in T1 MRC (relative to current T1 MRC), by size \u00a0\u2206 SA\u2206 IRB\u2206 CCP\u2206 SEC\u2206 MKT\u2206 OP\u2206 CVA\u2206 LR\u2206 OF\u2206 TotalAll banks2.72.70.10.62.53.33.9-0.59.124.4Large2.32.80.10.72.63.44.1-0.59.525.0of which: G-SIIs1.73.5-0.11.24.25.55.10.07.628.6of which: O-SIIs2.31.70.20.31.62.13.7-0.512.123.6Medium9.70.10.00.00.90.30.5-1.10.911.3Small10.70.00.2-1.90.0-3.70.3-0.10.05.5Sources: EBA 2018-Q2 quantitative impact study (QIS) data and EBA calculations.

Tier\u00a01 and total capital shortfalls include the shortfall incurred by institutions constrained by the leverage ratio in the revised framework.It is important to stress that the estimated impact included in these reports cannot be directly compared to the figures the EBA publishes periodically in the context of regular Basel III monitoring exercises (e.g. latest one in March 2019) which limit the impact analysis to Pillar 1 minimum requirements and specific buffer requirements (capital conservation buffer and G-SII buffer where applicable). The analysis published today includes Pillar 2 requirements and the full set of combined buffer requirements in the calculation of banks' minimum required capital and assumes that these requirements remain at current levels. These results should also be read in conjunction with a set of conservative assumptions underlying the assessment. Mainly, the lack of any adjustment carried out by banks or authorities in response to the implementation of Basel III. Banks' balance sheets are assumed to be static, meaning that banks will not alter their current exposures and all maturing assets are expected to be replaced by similar instruments.\u00a0 Pillar 2 and macro-prudential requirements (expressed in percentage of risk weighted assets) are also assumed to remain unchanged. This adds a significant degree of conservatism.Detailed policy recommendations are also provided for a number of areas of the Basel III framework in the four policy advice reports published today. These recommendations include: In the area of credit risk: all the newly agreed revisions should be implemented in the EU, maintaining a prudential framework based on external ratings and the loan-splitting approach to exposures secured by real estate. The report also recommends that no EU-specific supporting factors for SME and infrastructure lending exposures are retained.In the area of securities financing transactions: all the newly agreed revisions should be implemented in the EU, except for the minimum haircuts floor framework where EBA believes further analysis is needed.In the area of operational risk: the new Standardised Approach (SA) should be implemented. The SA should be based on the institution-specific historical loss component for larger institutions to maintain a risk-sensitive approach. For the same reason, smaller institutions may be allowed to also use the historical loss component on a case-by-case basis. The EBA advises the Commission to consider a phase-in period for the SA.The output floor should be introduced and, where applicable, should be used to compute all capital requirements, including EU-specific requirements such as the systemic risk buffer. The output floor should be applied at all levels of consolidation. The Basel Committee has recently made targeted revisions to the fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB), which is not assessed in this report.[1] In line with the request from the Commission, the EBA will publish its advice on the implementation of the finalised FRTB and CVA frameworks, and an analysis of the macroeconomic impact of the final Basel III framework later this year.

These draft GLs\u00a0 aim at ensuring that the methodology applicable for the determination of the WAM for regulatory purposes is sufficiently harmonised in order to increase consistency and comparability in the own funds held by institutions. \tThis methodology to determine the WAM of contractual payments due under the tranche of a securitisation transaction should be clear to avoid arbitrage and to allow less sophisticated institutions to use the External Ratings Based Approach for calculating risk weighted exposure amounts of a securitisation position (SEC-ERBA). In addition, the methodology should be conservative to maintain a sufficient level of prudence and simple to facilitate the supervision of competent authorities. \tThe revised CRR framework for securitisation introduced the maturity of the tranche as an additional risk factor to take into account when calculating the capital requirement of securitisation exposures. In particular, two alternative approaches could be applied when determining the maturity of a tranche: the WAM of the contractual payments due under the tranche or the final legal maturity of the tranche. \tThe purpose of these draft Guidelines is to provide the guiding principles for institutions opting for the WAM approach instead of the final legal maturity approach. This is done with the purpose of calculating the risk weighted exposure amounts of a securitisation position via the methods that use the maturity of the tranche as a risk factor, namely: (1) the Internal Ratings Based Approach for calculating risk weighted exposure amounts of a securitisation position (SEC-IRBA) and (2) SEC-ERBA. The main areas covered by the draft GLs are the following: \t\tMeaning of contractual payments due under the tranche; \t\tData and information requirements; \t\tMethodologies for determining the contractual payments of the securitised exposures, and of the tranches, both for traditional and synthetic securitisations; \t\tImplementation and use of the WAM model.

This Opinion forms part of the EBA's ongoing work to strengthen the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing in Europe and responds to a request in the Council Anti Money Laundering Action Plan of 2018. \tWith this Opinion, the EBA invites prudential supervisors to send a common message to institutions that prudential supervisors factor AML/CFT issues into the prudential supervisory process and cooperate closely with AML/CFT supervisors for this purpose. \tMoney laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) can have a significant, adverse impact on an institution's safety and soundness. This is why prudential supervisors need to be aware of, and act upon, ML/TF risks, which may pose prudential risks to the institutions they supervise and in particular: \t\tWhen considering whether to authorise an institution or when assessing proposed acquisitions of qualifying holdings; \t\tAs part of their ongoing supervision of institutions, for example when assessing the adequacy of an institution's governance and risk management systems; and \t\tWhen taking corrective measures to address potential weaknesses from a prudential perspective. \tThe EU Council made clear in its action plan of 2018 that the link between ML/TF risk and prudential objectives means that prudential and AML/CFT supervisors must cooperate closely and share information in the discharge of their respective functions. Where institutions operate across borders, the EBA expects supervisors to cooperate with their international counterparts. Note to the editors \t\tThis Opinion forms part of the EBA's wider work to strengthen the link between prudential and AML/CFT supervision.

The Report illustrates the developments on the regulatory perimeter across the EU, the regulatory status of FinTech firms, and the approaches followed by competent authorities when granting authorisation for banking and payment services. \tThe national regulatory status of FinTech firms with innovative business models or delivery mechanisms shows two developments: (a) the shift from non-regulated to regulated activities \u2013 notably payment initiation services and account information services now being subject to PSD2; and (b) the ancillary/non-financial nature of the services provided by FinTech firms not subject to any regulatory regime, with the exception of crowdfunding and to some extent activities related to crypto-assets.

On crowdfunding, the EBA takes note of the Commission's Proposal for Regulation on crowdfunding service operators. On crypto-asset related activities, the Report refers to the EBA January Report on crypto-assets and the follow-up actions. \tAs to authorisation approaches, the EBA found that proportionality and flexibility principles are applied in the same way by competent authorities irrespective of whether the applicant presents a traditional or innovative business model and/or delivery mechanism.

In this respect, to allow for a high quality implementation, the EBA has decided to extend the deadline for introducing changes in the rating systems by one year, to the end of 2021. In addition, considering the interactions with the final Basel III framework, published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in December 2017, the EBA allowed for the changes in the loss given default (LGD) and conversion factors models for low default portfolios to be implemented by the end of 2023, at the latest.Next stepsBesides the Guidelines on credit risk mitigation (CRM), which are currently under consultation, the EBA does not intend to make any further revisions to its guidance on internal models, as set out in its roadmap. While the industry and competent authorities are implementing the regulatory review of the IRB approach, the EBA's efforts will now focus on monitoring and exploring whether there is evidence of reduced variability of risk-weighted exposure amounts. In this area, the EBA has been performing an annual benchmarking exercise and will further develop and improve this tool through more thematic analyses and in cooperation with competent authorities. Furthermore, to support the implementation process, the EBA will also continue to use its Q&A tool.The EBA has also started work to improve transparency through harmonised Pillar 3 disclosures, based on the revised requirements set out in the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR2). In parallel, the EBA will undertake work on supervisory reporting to align it with the revised disclosure requirements. In addition, the EBA will carry out a more comprehensive review with a view to improving consistency of data requests with the definitions and clarifications developed in the regulatory review of the IRB approach. This broader work will take into account all the data requirements, including both supervisory reporting and data collected for the purpose of supervisory benchmarking.The EBA believes that the implementation of the EBA's bottom-up repair alongside the top-down reforms set out in the final Basel III framework will significantly reduce undue variability of own funds requirements. It is, therefore, important that the implementation efforts continue at the current high pace, ensuring continued credibility of the IRB framework.

In this report, the ESAs identified the main issues that national competent authorities (NCAs) face when supervising financial institutions that provide cross-border retail financial services within the EU and make recommendations to both NCAs and EU institutions on how to address them. In particular, the Report calls for more clarity on when activities carried out through digital means fall under passporting rules, and for considering the identified high-level principles on cooperation as the basis for any new legislation or possible amendment to current legislation. \tIn their Report, the ESAs recognise that the deepening of the EU Single Market in financial services and the digitalisation of financial services have intensified the demands placed on NCAs when supervising financial institutions that provide retail banking, investment, and/or insurance services across EU borders. The Report provides an overview of the main rules that apply in the EU in respect of consumer protection, conduct of business, and the cooperation between NCAs and assesses the extent to which these rules address the supervisory issues faced by NCAs. \tThe Report concludes with recommendations addressed to the European Commission, Council and Parliament, proposing to amend existing, or develop new, legislation to facilitate the deepening of the single market.

This Report points out the EBA's key observations on PIs' and EMIs' strategies and business model changes, in particular focusing on the current trends and drivers, the different approaches to FinTech, including their interaction with BigTech firms, and the level of implementation of innovative technologies. The Report, which is in line with the priorities listed in its FinTech Roadmap, does not foresee or intend to model scenarios for potential future development of institutions. The Report aims to share knowledge and provide support to supervisors and other stakeholders in identifying and understanding the main trends that could impact PIs' and EMIs' business models and pose potential challenges to their sustainability.Based on the EBA's observations, most PIs and EMIs are adapting their business models to cope with the competitive pressure and embrace PSD2 changes. Most institutions are keen to expand their products and services and enter new markets by (i) leveraging on cross-border services, (ii) requesting a licence to become a credit institution or third party provider (TPP), and/or (iii) embracing the new services provided under the PSD2.While there is a slight trend towards internal development of products and services using FinTech, without necessarily the involvement of external partners, a significant number of institutions partner with FinTech firms and technology providers for the development of innovative products.With BigTech firms posing a potential threat to the sustainability of PIs' and EMIs' business models, institutions are planning to focus on strengthening customer loyalty in a potential increased participation of BigTech firms. The outlook of the payments sector is quite positive in terms of revenues and profitability, with an overall expectation for increased customer base and new or revamped products, accompanied by an increase in internal FinTech developments and IT spending.A comparison with the respective report on credit institutions, published by the EBA in July 2018, may suggest a relationship between the growth of the payments sector and the disintermediation in banking, taking into account that incumbent credit institutions reported a negative impact on their payment-related revenues.PIs and EMIs face different threats, depending on their business model, from the potential impact of an active participation of BigTech firms, the uncertain impact of Brexit as well as the key dependencies on banks and card processors (for some PIs and EMIs). In addition, a number of key challenges will need to be addressed relating to operation resilience and ICT security, operational capacity, regulatory changes, customer education and acquisition and maintenance of skills and talent.Legal basis and next stepsArticle 9(2) of the EBA's Founding Regulation mandates the Authority to monitor new and existing financial activities.

The report focuses on the Guidelines on Product Oversight and Governance Arrangements (POG), which the EBA issued in 2015 to address large-scale retail conduct failure and mis-selling that was observed in the banking sector at the time. The report identifies a number of good and bad practices and outlines the next steps the EBA will take to fulfil its supervisory convergence mandate.The EBA promotes a transparent, simple and fair internal market for consumer financial products and services and seeks to foster consumer protection across the Union. One of the identified priorities stated in its work programme for 2019 is for the EBA to ensure a consistent implementation by financial institutions of the EBA's consumer protection requirements.In order to address some of the causal drivers of consumer detriment, the EBA issued in 2015 the POG Guidelines for manufacturers and distributors. The Guidelines are aimed at ensuring that products are developed and brought to market in a way that focuses on the needs and interests of the consumer and, in so doing, to reduce conduct costs and contribute to market confidence.This assessment, which uses a small sample of credit institutions from six Member States, shows that manufacturers have made welcome changes, in particular in terms of processes and governance. However, in a large number of cases, customer interests may not quite receive the same attention as the manufacturer's commercial interests and prudential concerns. The EBA's assessment also suggests that the industry may have different understandings of the guidelines and that further clarification may be warranted to ensure further convergence across Europe.The EBA will reflect on the findings in this report to identify specific actions, such as guidance and further clarifications, which may be needed to address the issues raised here.Legal basisArticle 1(5) of the EBA founding regulation requires the EBA to \"contribute to improving the functioning of the internal market, including, in particular, a sound, effective and consistent level of regulation and supervision, [\u2026] preventing regulatory arbitrage and promoting equal conditions of competition, [\u2026] and enhancing customer protection\" and to \"foster supervisory convergence\".

The Risk Dashboard includes for the first time IFRS\u00a09 related data on asset quality and banks' fair valued positions, as well as information about their sovereign exposures. Together with the Risk Dashboard, the EBA published the results of its Risk Assessment Questionnaire (RAQ), which includes banks' and market analysts' expectations for future trends and developments.European banks' CET1 ratios \u2013 both fully loaded and transitional \u2013 remained unchanged during the first quarter of the year, standing at 14.5% and 14.7%, respectively. Along with the capital components (CET1, numerator) also the risk exposures amounts (REAs, denominator) rose at similar pace, reflecting an increase in total loan volumes.The quality of EU/EEA banks' loan portfolio has improved further, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years. In Q1 2019, the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans declined to 3.1% (3.2% in Q4 2018 and 3.8% in Q1 2018). A small increase of EUR 4bn in the NPLs, due to one-off events, was more than offset by the rise of EUR 700bn in total loan volumes (denominator). Similar to the contraction of the NPL ratio, also the share of stage 2 (7.2% of total loans) and of stage 3 (3.6%) loans have declined during recent quarters, including Q1 2019.According to the responses to the RAQ, banks plan to further expand their corporate lending, especially in the SME segment, and their household exposures through both, mortgages and consumer lending. Almost half of the banks aim to fund their growth by increasing MREL liabilities and retail deposits. Nonetheless, banks and analysts are now more pessimistic in respect of future trends in asset quality. Respondents are particularly concerned about the possible deterioration of corporate and commercial real estate exposures.Profitability of EU/EEA banks has not improved and remains a key challenge for the sector. The average return on equity (RoE) stood at 6.8%, similar to the same quarter last year. Cost inflation weighed on banks' cost to income ratio (CIR) as it reached its highest level since December 2014 (66.3%, up from 65% a year earlier). On the contrary, banks' net interest margin (NIM) tightened further in the first quarter to 1.42%, its lowest level since December 2014.Banks expect profitability to remain subdued, with only about 25% expecting an improvement in the next 6-12 months. Almost 50% of banks participating in the RAQ suggest their current earnings do not cover their cost of equity (CoE). The latter is estimated by the banks in a range of 8%-10%. In order to improve their net income, banks mainly aim to reduce their operating costs and to diversify their income streams by increasing fees and commissions through asset management and payment services.Notes to editorsThe figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 150 banks, covering more than 80% of the EU banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates also include large subsidiaries (the list of banks can be found under https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data).

This work, which responds to a Commission's call for advice, shows that the full implementation of Basel III in the EU, under the most conservative assumptions, increases the weighted average minimum capital requirement (MRC) by 24.4%, leading to an aggregate capital shortfall of EUR 135.1 bn. Importantly, the capital impact is almost entirely driven by large globally active banks. The impact on medium-sized banks is limited to 11.3% in terms of MRC, leading to a shortfall of EUR 0.9 bn, and on small banks to 5.5% MRC with a EUR 0.1 bn shortfall. The EBA will publish the full report by the end of July. Overall, the EBA welcomes the improvements introduced in the final Basel III package. These include the introduction of a higher degree of risk sensitivity in the standardised approaches to measure credit and operational risk, and constraints to modelling of low-default portfolios where, in the past, undue variability was observed in internal credit risk models. Today's results show that following the full implementation of Basel III in the EU, the increase in minimum capital requirements (MRC) and the related capital shortfall varies across banks. The weighted average increase in MRC is 24.4% for the entire sample, under conservative assumptions. However, for half of the banks in the sample, the impact is less than 10.6%, while the MRC increase for small banks is limited to 5.5%. For a quarter of the banks in the sample, MRC decreases. The total capital shortfall is about EUR 135 bn, almost entirely in large banks, and this shortfall would be reduced to EUR 58.7 bn if banks were to retain profits (based on 2014-18 data) throughout the transition period.\u00a0 These results of the quantitative impact study (QIS) should also be read in conjunction with a set of very conservative assumptions applied to the assessment, namely: \t\tBanks' balance sheets were assumed to be static, meaning that balance sheets are frozen and all maturing assets are expected to be replaced by similar instruments. \t\tGiven uncertainty over the impact, the underlying data are likely to reflect conservative reporting by banks. \t\tThe analysis assumes that current EU-specific choices and exemptions are discontinued and the impact, therefore, fully reflects the existing global standards. \t\tThis assessment, compared to previously presented analyses on the Basel impact, includes the impact of Pillar 2 and macroprudential requirements, which in the analysis were assumed to be static. \t\tDue to the late finalisation of the market risk part of the Basel reform, the so-called fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB), the impact was computed using the calibration of the 2016 market risk regime. The incorporation of the recently approved FRTB reform would lower the impact. Note to the editors This QIS is based on a set of different methodological assumptions than those used for the regular Basel III monitoring exercise. Therefore, the figures of this assessment cannot be compared to those of previous monitoring exercises.

The Opinion is a response to continued queries from market actors as to which authentication approaches the EBA considers to be compliant with SCA. The Opinion also addresses concerns about the preparedness and compliance of some actors in the payments chain with the SCA requirements that apply as of 14 September 2019. \tToday's Opinion provides a non-exhaustive list of the authentication approaches currently observed in the market and states whether or not they are considered to be SCA compliant. The Opinion does so separately for each of the three SCA elements of knowledge, possession and inherence, and also provides clarifications regarding combinations of these elements. \tThe Opinion also responds to the concerns about market preparedness, by clarifying that the EBA is legally not able to postpone an application date that is set out in EU law. The Opinion also explains that sufficient time has been available for the industry to prepare for the application date of SCA, given that the definition of SCA had been set out in PSD2 when it was published in 2015, which gave clear indications that existing authentication approaches would need to be phased out, and because PSD2 already granted an additional 18-month period for the industry to implement SCA. \tHowever, the Opinion acknowledges the complexity of the payments markets across the EU and the challenges arising from the changes that are required, in particular by actors that are not payment service providers (PSPs) and, therefore, not directly subject to PSD2 and the EBA's technical standards, such as e-merchants, which may lead to some actors in the payments chain not being ready by 14 September 2019. \u00a0 \tThe EBA, therefore, accepts that, on an exceptional basis and in order to avoid unintended negative consequences for some payment service users after 14 September 2019, NCAs may decide to work with PSPs and relevant stakeholders, including consumers and merchants, to provide limited additional time. This is to allow issuers to migrate to authentication approaches that are compliant with SCA, such as those described in this Opinion, and acquirers to migrate their merchants to solutions that support SCA. \tThis supervisory flexibility is available under the condition that PSPs have set up a migration plan, have agreed the plan with their NCA, and will execute the plan in an expedited manner. \tIn order to fulfil the objectives of PSD2 and the EBA of achieving consistency across the EU, the EBA will later this year communicate deadlines by which the aforementioned actors will have to have completed their migration plans. Background \tThe revised Payment Services Directive was published in November 2015, entered into force on 13 January 2016 and applies since 13 January 2018. The Directive brings fundamental changes to the payments market in the EU, in particular by requiring SCA to be applied by payment services providers (PSPs) when carrying out remote electronic transactions. \tSCA is defined in the Directive as an \"authentication based on the use of two or more elements categorised as knowledge (something only the user knows), possession (something only the user possesses) and inherence (something the user is) that are independent, in that the breach of one does not compromise the reliability of the others, and is designed in such a way as to protect the confidentiality of the authentication data.\" The Directive also provides that SCA is to be applied to all electronic payments, unless one of the exemptions applies. \tThe EBA had been mandated to support the Directive by developing regulatory technical standards (RTS) setting out the details on strong customer authentication and common and secure communication (RTS on SCA and CSC), including its exemptions, and to regulate the access to customer payment account data held in account servicing payment service providers. \tThe RTS were developed in 2015/16, consulted on during 2016/17, adopted as Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/389 on 27 November 2017, published in the Official Journal on 13 March 2018, and will legally apply from 14 September 2019. The RTS deliberately refrains from referring to any particular authentication approaches in the industry, in order to ensure that the RTS remains technology neutral and future-proof. Legal basis \tThe EBA issued the Opinion\u00a0in accordance with Article 29(1)(a) of its Founding Regulation, which mandates the Authority to play an active role in building a common Union supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices, as well as in ensuring uniform procedures and consistent approaches throughout the Union.

Learning from the elevated levels of non-performing exposures (NPEs) across the EU in recent years, the draft guidelines aim to ensure that institutions have robust and prudent standards for credit risk taking, management and monitoring, and that newly originated loans are of high credit quality. The draft Guidelines also aim to ensure that the institutions' practices are aligned with consumer protection rules and AML requirements. The consultation runs until 30 September 2019. \tThe draft Guidelines specify the internal governance arrangements for granting and monitoring of credit facilities throughout their lifecycle. They introduce requirements for borrowers' creditworthiness assessment and bring together the EBA's prudential and consumer protection objectives. \tThe EBA has developed these Guidelines building on the existing national experiences, addressing shortcomings in the institutions' credit granting policies and practices highlighted by the recent financial crisis. At the same time, these Guidelines reflect recent supervisory priorities and policy developments related to credit granting. Particularly, they account for the need to consider in credit granting environmental, social and governance factors, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, as well as technology-based innovation. \tThe draft Guidelines represent the first instance in which the EBA is proposing requirements that apply to providers of consumer credit under the Consumer Credit Directive (CCD) and to non-bank mortgage credit providers under the Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD).

This result is mainly triggered by the levies paid by the members of those DGSs, which were raised in order to reach the target level of 0.8% of covered deposits set out in the DGSD and to be attained by July 2024.\u00a0No significant changes to the available financial means occurred in eight DGSs, mainly because most of them already hold more than the minimum target level of 0.8%. The available financial means decreased only for one DGS, which used its funds to repay outstanding loans. Five DGSs used their available financial means in 2018 to pay out depositors without causing a fall in such funds compared to the previous year, as the use of these funds was at least matched by contributions to the available financial means.The data also shows that the target level of 0.8% of covered deposits had already been achieved by 17 of the 43 DGSs in the EU.Legal basisThe EBA is collecting this data in accordance with Art. 10(10) of the DGSD.On 25 October 2016, the EBA decided to make this data publicly available on its website.

In particular, the EBA increased its monitoring role on key parts of the prudential framework such as capital, liquidity, securitisation or models with the aim of strengthening supervisory convergence and the integrity of the single rulebook. \tAnother important part of the EBA's work focused on payments, namely on the delivery of technical standards and guidelines under PSD2 as well as on supervisory converge to ensure that the PSD2 requirements are applied in a sound, efficient and consistent manner across the EU. \tIn 2018, the EBA continued to work with EU authorities and institutions to fulfil the objectives of the Council action plan to tackle NPLs in Europe. To this end, the EBA published its revised NPL transaction templates as well as the guidelines on disclosure of non-performing and forborne exposures. \tThroughout 2018, the EBA made great efforts to ensure good preparedness at all levels for the consequences of the UK's withdrawal, taking into account all possible outcomes, including the worst-case scenario. \tEnhancing the transparency of the European banking sector through the disclosure of individual data on EU and EEA banks remained one of the key objectives of the EBA in 2018, which was achieved mainly through the publication of the annual EU-wide transparency exercise as well as the 2018 EU-wide stress test. \tWhile the EBA has been working on financial innovation since its inception, its FinTech roadmap, published in March 2018, put in place a number of priorities for the next few years and launched the EBA FinTech Knowledge Hub. \tIn 2018, The EBA, together with European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) worked on developing a framework aimed at improving the effectiveness of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision across the EU and strengthening cooperation and information exchange between national supervisory authorities, both domestically and across borders. In particular, two technical standards and three guidelines came into force, which represent an important first step on the road towards a more consistent and effective European AML/CFT regime. \tThe Commission's Call for Advice on the impact and implementation of the revised Basel III framework aiming to finalise the post-crisis reforms and improving the balance between simplicity, comparability and risk sensitivity of capital requirements is another important task the EBA started to work on in 2018. \tFinally, in December 2018, the EU legislators endorsed a package of measures aimed at reducing risks in the EU banking sector.

These draft technical standards specify key aspects of the SA-CCR and represent an important contribution to its smooth harmonised implementation in the EU. The draft technical standards were developed based on the mandates included in the latest available version of proposed amended Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR2). The consultation runs until 2 August 2019.The draft technical standards build on the proposals included in the Discussion Paper published on 18 December 2017 and industry feedback received as a result of the subsequent consultation. They specify methods for the mapping of derivative transactions to risk categories, a formula for the calculation of the supervisory delta of options mapped to the interest rate risk category and a method for determining whether derivative transactions are long or short in their risk drivers.In particular, the EBA proposes a three-pronged methodology for the mapping of derivative transactions to risk categories. The first approach, purely qualitative and suitable for simple and standard derivative transactions, refers to certain criteria, which have to be satisfied. The second more detailed approach, hinges on a quantitative assessment of the sensitivities with respect to each possible risk driver, in order to identify the material ones. The third approach, intentionally simple and conservative, identifies all possible risk drivers of a transaction as material and allocates the transaction to all relevant risk-categories. This last approach is always available as a fallback to the second approach.In addition, the EBA proposes to use, in line with Basel standards, a supervisory delta formula based on a shifted Black-Scholes model that allows dealing with situations of negative interest rates. The shift is intended to move interest rates back into positive territory in order to make the application of the Black-Scholes model feasible. The EBA proposes a methodology for determining the shift to be included in the formula and requests feedback with respect to the different options proposed, including on the possible level of application. Finally, the EBA tried to reduce the burden for institutions in the determination of the direction of the position in that particular risk driver (long or short) by leveraging on the same elements (i.e. cash flows and sensitivities) that institutions use for the mapping of derivatives to risk categories.Consultation processComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

As all the stages of the legislative procedure for the CRR2 text have not been completed, the version that was taken into account for drafting those draft RTS is the European Parliament legislative resolution of 16 April 2019. As a result, the proposed draft RTS may be amended after the consultation to take into account potential changes in the final CRR2 text.According to the above version, the EBA is expected to develop: a) the method for identifying transactions with only one material risk driver, b) the method for identifying transactions with more than one material risk driver and for identifying the most material of those risk drivers, c) in accordance with international regulatory developments, the formula that institutions shall use to calculate the supervisory delta of call and put options mapped to the interest rate risk category compatible with market conditions in which interest rates may be negative as well as the supervisory volatility that is suitable for that formula, and d) the method for determining whether a transaction is a long or short position in the primary risk driver or in the most material risk driver in the given risk category.

Considering the progress observed in the functioning of colleges over the years, the Report mainly focuses on the quality of the colleges' deliverables and highlights examples of good practice. Overall, the EBA has identified significant improvement in the colleges' deliverables although further efforts are needed, in particular to ensure that the group risk/liquidity risk assessment reports form a real joint assessment of the group-wide risks. \tThe core of the Report focuses on some key observations regarding the 2018 cycle of supervisory colleges. These observations cover (i) organisational aspects of the colleges' work and interactions, (ii) colleges' deliverables and (iii) the key topics for supervisory attention in 2018. \tOn the organisational aspects of the colleges' work and interactions, the Report notices a relatively high level of convergence among the colleges in terms of form and conduct but observes that some areas for improvement remain, for instance regarding the timely distribution of meeting documents. Considering the ever-increasing importance of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), supervisory colleges are invited to discuss this topic on a regular basis. \tRegarding the colleges' deliverables (the group risk/liquidity risk assessment reports, as well as the joint decisions on capital, liquidity and recovery plans), the Report highlights that, in general, significant progress has been made. However, in some cases, the group risk/liquidity risk assessment reports still tend to be a compilation of the findings and assessments of the individual competent authorities and the information provided does not always enable readers to easily form a thorough opinion on the various topics. Moreover, despite the improvements achieved in the quality of the joint decisions, the Report notes that, in general, the reasoning for the liquidity joint decisions was less robust than for the capital joint decisions. \tSeven key topics for supervisory attention had been identified for 2018, namely, (i) non-performing loan cleaning, (ii) business model and profitability, (iii) information technology risk and operational resilience, (iv) internal governance, (v) Brexit, (vi) structural changes and (vii) the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9. In general, in 2018, colleges of supervisors reflected these topics in their interactions. \tThe Report also sets out the colleges' action plan for 2019, which includes (i) the key tasks for supervisory colleges, as defined by the legal framework; (ii) the key topics for supervisory attention; and (iii) the EBA's approach for college monitoring in 2019. \tNote to the editors \t\tSupervisory colleges are the forum for planning and coordinating supervisory activities, sharing important information about the supervised entity and most importantly for conducting the supervisory risk/liquidity risk assessment and reaching joint decisions on institution specific requirements and on the assessment of group recovery plan. \t\tIn line with its mandate to promote the effective and consistent functioning of supervisory colleges across the EU, the EBA monitored the activities of colleges established for the supervision of cross-border banking groups.

Guided by this objective, the proposals presented in the Advice aim at promoting stronger operational resilience and harmonisation in the EU financial sector by applying changes to their respective sectoral legislation. Incident reporting is highly relevant to ICT risk management and allows relevant entities and authorities to log, monitor, analyse and respond to ICT operational, ICT security and fraud incidents. Therefore, the ESAs call for streamlining aspects of the incident reporting frameworks across the financial sector. Furthermore, the ESAs suggest that a legislative solution for an appropriate oversight framework to monitor the activities of critical third party service providers should be considered. \tRegarding the costs and benefits of a coherent cyber resilience testing framework, the ESAs see clear benefits of such a framework. However, at present there are significant differences across and within financial sectors as regards the maturity level of cybersecurity. In the short-term, the ESAs advise to focus on achieving a minimum level of cyber-resilience across the sectors, proportionate to the needs and characteristics of the relevant entities. Furthermore, the ESAs propose to establish on a voluntary basis an EU wide coherent testing framework together with other relevant authorities taking into account existing initiatives, and with a focus on Threat Lead Penetration Testing (TLPT). In the long-term, the ESAs aim to ensure a sufficient cyber maturity level of identified cross-sector entities. \tTo implement the proposed actions, the ESAs highlight the required legal basis and explicit mandate, which is necessary for the development and implementation of a coherent resilience testing framework across all financial sectors by the ESAs in cooperation with other relevant authorities. \tBackground \tThe European Commission's March 2018 FinTech Action Plan specifically requests the ESAs: \t\tTo map, by Q1\u20092019, the existing supervisory practices across financial sectors around ICT security and governance requirements, and where appropriate a) to consider issuing guidelines aimed at supervisory convergence and enforcement of ICT risk management and mitigation requirements in the EU financial sector and, b) if necessary, provide the Commission with technical advice on the need for legislative improvements. \t\tTo evaluate, by Q4\u20092018 (now Q1 2019), the costs and benefits of developing a coherent cyber resilience testing framework for significant market participants and infrastructures within the whole EU financial sector.

These draft RTS aim at striking the right balance between the need to acknowledge the specific circumstances under which institutions calculate capital requirements in the context of a securitisation transaction and the need to maintain appropriately safe and prudent requirements on the internal modelling of capital requirements. The RTS are part of 28 mandates assigned to the EBA within its important role in the implementation of the new securitisation framework. \tIn order to expand the use of the Securitisation Internal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA), which sits now at the top of the hierarchy of approaches for calculating capital requirements of securitisation positions, the CRR amendment accompanying the Securitisation Regulation introduces the possibility of using the provisions that normally apply to purchased receivables under the general IRB credit risk framework. This way, eligible institutions may calculate the KIRB, and the corresponding risk parameters, (probability of default \u2013(PD)\u00a0 and loss given default \u2013(LGD)), under the provisions of the purchased receivables and then use them as input in the SEC-IRBA, along with other information on the securitisation position. \tThe draft RTS specify the conditions under which institutions may use the provisions on purchased receivables to make them fully workable in the context of securitisation transactions. For thipurpose, retail securitised exposures shall be treated as purchased retail receivables and non-retail securitised exposures as purchased corporate receivables. \tThe main areas that the draft RTS covers are the following: \t\tGeneral approach to the relationship between the IRB rules on purchased receivables and the SEC-IRBA framework \t\tEligibility conditions to compute KIRB under the RTS \t\tIRB permissions and prior experience \t\tEligibility to use the retail risk quantification standards \t\tUse of proxy data Legal basis \tThe RTS have been developed according to Article 255(9) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by Regulation (EU) 2401/2017.

Therefore, the ESAs calls for the following policy actions by European and national competent authorities (NCAs) as well as financial institutions: Contingency Plans: It is crucial that European Union financial institutions, market participants and their counterparties enact timely contingency plans to prepare for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, including possible market volatility a no-deal Brexit may trigger. The ESAs are closely monitoring Brexit developments and the possible associated risks of a no-deal scenario. The ESAs issued Opinions and Recommendations to provide important guidance for financial institutions, market participants and NCAs in this regard. Stress Tests: Against the backdrop of the potential for sudden risk premia reversals with a risk of rising funding costs, the development and regular use of stress tests across all sectors remains crucial. Therefore, the scenarios for the 2018 bank and insurance stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) reflected these risks. Furthermore, the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) will present guidelines on fund liquidity and Money Market Fund stress testing during 2019. ESMA is also preparing its next Central Counter Parties (CCPs) stress test. The EBA has started to prepare the methodology for its 2020 stress test exercise, and EIOPA launched its 2019 Occupational Pensions Stress Test. Banks: Banks should develop strategies to carefully manage and address large refinancing needs, including building loss-absorbing capacity. In addition, banks should continue with efforts to address the stocks of non-performing loans (NPLs), and should review their business model to improve profitability. In addition, it is important that banks carefully manage their credit risk and interest rate risk. New bank lending has started to increase and warrants close monitoring of credit quality trends of new lending portfolios. Banks need to ensure that lending standards and covenant requirements do not weaken. The financial sector and banks in particular, need to manage their sovereign exposure carefully, which might imply a significant impact on their profitability and capital. Insurance: Supervisors and insurance companies need to ensure that risks of a potentially sudden reassessment of risk premia and continued low interest rates are properly monitored and analysed as well as appropriate mitigating actions taken. In this context, the vulnerabilities identified in EIOPA's 2018 Insurance Stress Test need to be addressed. \t\t\t\u00a0 Background \tThe Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).

In comparison with 2017, the Dashboard confirms improved asset quality, stable capital ratios, but profitability still below long-term sustainable levels. European banks' capital ratios remain high with a slight decrease when compared to 2017. The CET1 (transitional) ratio was 14.6% in December 2018 (14.9% in 2017). The decrease is driven by an increase in the total risk exposure amount. CET1 ratios remained above 11% for all countries in the sample. The fully loaded CET1 ratio also showed a decrease and stood at 14.4% compared to 14.6% in 2017. The quality of EU banks' loan portfolio continues to improve. In 2018, the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans kept the downward trend and reached a value of 3.2%, showing its lowest level since the NPL definition was harmonised across the EU/EEA. The NPL decline is attributed both to the upward trend of total loans granted and to the steady decline in the amount of non-performing loans (658 EUR billion in Q4 2018). However, dispersion across EU/EEA countries remained high, and economic slowdown could make further improvements harder to achieve. The coverage ratio was 45.1% in Q4 of 2018, compared to 44.6% in Q4 of 2017. Profitability showed only a small sign of improvement. The RoE increased to 6.5% compared to 6.0% in 2017. The heatmap shows that the share of total assets held by banks with RoE above 6% is 61.6%, which is an improvement compared to 46.7% in 2017. The dispersion narrowed in 2018, with the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile at 6% when compared with 7.4% in 2017. The Leverage ratio remains stable. The leverage ratio (fully phased-in) in Q4 2018 stood at 5.3%, a marginal decrease from 5.4% in Q4 2017. The asset encumbrance ratio remained stable compared to 2017.

The EBA Basel III capital monitoring report includes a preliminary assessment of the impact of the Basel reform package on EU banks, assuming its full implementation. The report on liquidity measures monitors and evaluates the liquidity coverage requirements currently in place in the EU. Overall, the EBA estimates that the Basel III reforms, once fully implemented, would determine an average increase by 19.1% of EU banks' Tier 1 minimum required capital.\u00a0 The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of EU banks, which was fully implemented in January 2018, stood at around 146% on average in June 2018, materially above the minimum threshold of 100%. However, some individual institutions reported shortfalls in the overall LCR. \u00a0Basel III capital monitoring resultsThe Basel III monitoring report assesses the impact on EU banks of the final revisions of credit risk, split into four sub-categories, operational risk, and leverage ratio frameworks, as well as of the introduction of the aggregate output floor. It also quantifies the impact of the new standards for market risk (FRTB) and credit valuation adjustments (CVA).\u00a0Overall, the results of the Basel III capital monitoring exercise, based on data as of 30 June 2018, show that European banks' minimum Tier 1 capital requirement would increase by 19.1% at the full implementation date (2027). The impact of the risk-based reforms is 25.4%, of which the leading factors are the output floor (8.0%) and operational risk (5.5%).\u00a0 The fact that leverage ratio is currently the constraining (i.e. the highest) Tier 1 requirement for some banks in the sample but will not be as constraining under the final Basel III, explains why part of the increase in the risk-based capital metric (-6.2%) is not to be accounted for as an actual increase in the overall Tier 1 requirement. This offsetting effect (-6.2%) is attributed to the leverage ratio contribution to the total impact.\u00a0 \u00a0Change in total T1 MRC, as percentage of the overall current Tier 1 MRC, due to the full implementation of Basel III (2027) (weighted averages, in %) Bank groupCredit riskMarket riskCVAOp riskOutput floorTotal risk-basedRevised LRTotal\u00a0SAIRBSec.CCPs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All banks2.22.00.70.02.34.75.58.025.4-6.219.1Group 11.81.70.80.02.54.96.18.526.3-6.020.3Of which: G-SIIs2.22.11.10.03.35.47.47.328.8-0.328.4Group 24.33.70.10.00.93.61.75.119.4-7.711.8Source: EBA QIS data (June 2018)\u00a0To comply with the new framework, EU banks would need EUR 39.0 billion of additional total capital, of which EUR 24.2 billion of Tier 1 capital.The current report provides a high-level impact assessment of final Basel III reforms.

At the reporting date of 30 June 2018, EU banks' average LCR was 146%. The aggregate gross shortfall amounted to EUR 22.5 billion corresponding to four banks that monetised their liquidity buffers during times of stress. A more in-depth analysis of potential currency mismatches in LCR levels, suggests that banks tend to hold significantly lower liquidity buffers in some foreign currencies, in particular US dollar.\u00a0Notes to the editors The cumulative impact analysis of the Basel III monitoring exercise report uses a total sample of 123 banks.The results of the Basel III capital monitoring report are presented separately for Group 1 and Group 2 banks. Group 1 banks are those with Tier 1 capital in excess of EUR 3 billion and are internationally active. All other banks are categorised as Group 2 banks.\u00a0The analysis of the Basel III capital monitoring report provides separate figures for the sample of global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs).

Some figures are presented by country.Article 412(1) of the CRR foresees the possibility of monetising liquid assets during times of stress (resulting in an LCR below 100%) as maintaining the LCR at 100%, under such circumstances, could produce undue negative effects on the credit institution and other market participants.

The EBA's work in supervisory convergence aims at fostering comparable supervisory approaches across the single market. This is necessary to ensure a level playing field, effective supervision of cross border groups, and to promote supervisory best practices.\u00a0 \tThis Report provides a summary of the EBA's observations on the current state of convergence of supervisory practices and highlights the EBA's activities carried out in 2018 to promote this convergence in accordance with its mandates as set out in its Founding Regulation and in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). \tThe Report covers, in particular, the EBA's assessment of the convergence in the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) as well as the supervisory convergence in the continuum between ongoing supervision, recovery and resolution. The latter is a new consideration given the relatively new entry into force of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). \tOverall, the Report notes that in 2018, competent authorities made good progress in the implementation of the 2014 SREP Guidelines as well as in taking forward the recommendations and observations made by the EBA during the 2016 and 2017 bilateral convergence visits. The Report highlights, however, a number of remaining challenges, in particular, in converging capital adequacy assessments and determining institution-specific additional own funds requirements. \tThe Report observes that the continuum between ongoing supervision, recovery and resolution is progressively benefitting from the implementation of internal procedures, which take into account the Single Rulebook and contributes to ensuring the convergence of supervisory practices. Further improvements are still needed on key aspects, in particular, to ensure that all the institutions, which do not benefit from a waiver have developed a recovery plan. \tThe development of the Single Rulebook dedicated to supervisory activities, as well as the monitoring of its effective and consistent application will remain the core business of the EBA in the coming years. The EBA will also further expand its training programme for authorities assisting in the implementation of the regulatory and policy products. Notes to editors \tOne of the EBA's key mandates is to develop ensure supervisory convergence and consistency of supervisory outcomes within the EU. In addition, Article 107 of Directive the CRD includes a specific mandate for the EBA on consistency of supervisory reviews, evaluations and supervisory measures in Member States. This Article also requires the EBA to report to the EU Parliament and the Council on the degree of convergence of supervisory practices. \tBased on this mandate, the EBA has collected information and analysed relevant supervisory practices. It has also developed a number of Guidelines and Technical Standards and contributed to the promotion of convergence in supervision through its participation in colleges of supervisors of cross-border institutions, the development of a European Supervisory Handbook, the provision of dedicated training, and the performance of analytical and benchmarking activities.

In particular, the Guidelines focus on requirements for the quantification of the calibration target used for downturn LGD estimation. The Guidelines complete the EBA's broader work on the review of the IRB approach aiming at reducing the unjustified variability in the outcomes of internal models, while preserving the risk sensitivity of capital requirements. Starting from the relevant downturn period(s) identified in accordance with the related Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS), the final Guidelines set out requirements for the appropriate quantification of the calibration target used for downturn LGD estimates and include three types of approaches:Type-1 approaches can be applied when banks have sufficient loss data for the identified downturn period. In this case, institutions are allowed some modelling flexibility, but subject to a harmonised and prescriptive impact assessment;Type-2 approaches can be applied when banks do not have sufficient loss data for the identified downturn period. In this case, institutions are given the choice between two approaches, the so-called haircut or extrapolation approaches This will harmonise the approaches used by banks.Type-3 approaches can be applied in rare cases, where neither type-1 nor type-2 approaches can be used. In this case, banks have to apply a minimum margin of conservatism (MoC) requirement of 15 percentage points on LGD estimates.Finally a reference value is put in place that acts as a non-binding challenger to the final downturn LGD estimation.Legal basis, implementation and next stepsThe EBA has developed these Guidelines on its own initiative in accordance with Article 16 of its founding Regulation, which mandates the Authority to issue guidelines and recommendations addressed to competent authorities or financial institutions with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the ESFS, and to ensuring the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law.The Guidelines will apply as of 1 January 2021, at the latest, but earlier implementation is encouraged.

In this Opinion, the EBA calls on the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Designated Authorities (DGSDAs) to ensure that depositors in the branches of the UK credit institutions in the EU are adequately protected by the EU deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs), in case of a withdrawal of the UK from the EU with no ratified agreement in place.\u00a0 \tThe withdrawal of the UK from the EU is not likely to have an impact on the protection of deposits in the vast majority of credit institutions operating in the EU. It may affect branches of UK credit institutions in the EU depending on the decisions taken by the UK authorities on the potential exclusion of such branches from the scope of the UK depositor protection scheme, after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. \tIn its Opinion addressed only to the DGSDAs, the EBA is of the view that the EU DGSDAs need to take active steps to ensure that deposits in such branches operating in the EU continue to be adequately protected after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. In a bid to ensure that covered deposits are protected, the EBA recommends that those branches become members of local EU DGSs. \tThe EBA also explains when, how and by whom depositors should be informed about any potential changes to the protection of their deposits. The EBA also recalls applicable provisions in relation to potential transfers of some DGS funds between the UK and the EU DGSs, which does not have a direct impact on the level of protection offered to depositors. \tFinally, the Opinion highlights to the DGSDAs potential issues stemming from depositors in branches of EU credit institutions operating in the UK potentially being covered by both the UK and the EU DGSs. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe competence of the European Banking Authority (EBA) to deliver an opinion is based on Article\u00a029(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01093/2010 (the EBA Regulation), and part of the EBA's objective is to promote a consistent approach in the area of deposit guarantees to ensure a level playing field and the equal treatment of depositors across the European Union (EU). \tWhere depositors or credit institutions have any questions in light of the Opinion issued by the EBA, they should contact their local DGS and or the DGSDAs to discuss and to seek guidance, where necessary.

The aim of the Guidelines is to establish a more harmonised framework for these financial institutions, namely credit institutions and investment firms subject to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), as well as payment and electronic money institutions. The recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers, published in December 2017, has also been integrated into the Guidelines. \tIn the context of digitalisation and given the increasing importance of new financial technology (Fintech) providers, financial institutions are adapting their business models to embrace such innovations. Some have intensified the use of Fintech solutions and have launched projects to improve their cost efficiency also in response to the intermediation margins of the traditional banking business model being put under pressure by the low interest rate environment. Outsourcing is a way to get relatively easy access to new technologies and to achieve economies of scale. \tThe new Guidelines, which are consistent with the requirements on outsourcing under the Payments Services Directive (PSD2), the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and the Commission's Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565[1], aim at ensuring that institutions can apply a single framework on outsourcing for all their banking, investment and payment activities and services. Such a framework also ensures a level playing field between different types of financial institutions. \tIn particular, the Guidelines clarify that the management body of each financial institution remains responsible for that institution and its activities at all times. To this end, the management body should ensure that sufficient resources are available to appropriately support and ensure the performance of those responsibilities, including overseeing all risks and managing the outsourcing arrangements. Outsourcing must not lead to a situation in which an institution becomes an \u2018empty shell' that lacks the substance to remain authorised. \tParticular challenges to ensure the effective supervision of institutions and payment institutions exist when functions are outsourced to service providers located in third countries. Financial institutions are expected to ensure compliance with EU legislation and regulatory requirements (e.g. professional secrecy, access to information and data, protection of personal data) in particular regarding critical or important functions outsourced to service providers. \tIn this respect, the Guidelines specify which arrangements with third parties are to be considered as outsourcing. The Guidelines differentiate between requirements on critical and important outsourcing arrangements and other outsourcing arrangements Outsourcing of critical and important functions has a higher impact on the institutions' and payment institutions' risk profile. Hence, the requirements are stricter as compared to the requirements for other less risky outsourcing arrangements. \tFinally, competent authorities are required to effectively supervise financial institutions' outsourcing arrangements, including identifying and monitoring risk concentrations at individual service providers and assessing whether or not such concentrations could pose a risk to the stability of the financial system. To identify such risk concentrations, competent authorities should be able to rely on comprehensive documentation on outsourcing arrangements compiled by financial institutions. \tLegal basis and next step \tArticle 74 (1) of CRD requires that institutions must have robust governance arrangements, which include a clear organisational structure. Outsourcing arrangements are one aspect of institutions' and payment institutions' organisational structure. Paragraph (3) of that Article mandates the EBA to issue Guidelines on those arrangements, processes and mechanisms. \tUnder Article\u00a016 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010[2] (the EBA Regulation), the EBA is also required to issue guidelines and recommendations addressed to competent authorities and financial institutions with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices and ensuring the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law. In particular, the conditions for outsourcing of functions of banking activities by institutions are not harmonised to the same extent as for institutions and payment institutions subject to MiFID II and PSD2. \tThe EBA Guidelines will enter into force on 30 September 2019 and contain some transitional periods for implementing a register of all outsourcing arrangements and to agree on cooperation agreements between competent authorities or to reintegrate outsourced functions or move them to other service providers, if the requirements of the guidelines can otherwise not be met.

It also outlines the related issues and the applicable legislative and regulatory framework, including the measures the EBA has undertaken to address them.In this Report, the EBA observed that mortgages continue to have a big impact on consumers' personal finances, representing 77% of loans to households, and follow a trend of slight increase in terms of volume and value for the past five years. During the same period, the volume of consumer credit was relatively stable, while deposits slightly decreased in their volume. With reference to payment accounts, the EBA observed that the number of people holding a payment account within the EU increased and covered a significant percentage of the EU population. This may have resulted in the significant increase in the use of digital and online payment services.The Report also identified the most relevant topics for consumers, such as fees and charges; indebtedness, responsible lending and creditworthiness assessment; financial literacy and education; transparency and disclosure of pre-contractual information and changes to contractual terms and conditions; data breach and cyber security; and cross-border selling of products and services. More specifically, these topics focus on issues related to consumer detriment arising from the lack of transparency and disclosure of information on fees and charges, poor creditworthiness assessments, and the complexity of financial products.This Report builds on information provided by the national competent authorities of the 28 EU Member States, as well as on input received from various external stakeholders, such as national and EU consumer associations, the members of the \u2018Financial Dispute Resolution Network' and EU industry associations. The Report also assesses quantitative data from the European Central Bank and the World Bank.Legal basisThe Consumer Trends Report for 2018/19 has been developed according to Article 9 of the EBA founding Regulation, which requires the Authority to take a leading role in promoting transparency, simplicity and fairness in the market for consumer financial products or services across the internal market, including by collecting, analysing and reporting on consumer trends.

Therefore, the ESAs recommend PRIIP manufacturers to include a warning in the KID to ensure that retail investors are fully aware of the limitations of the figures provided in the performance scenarios. Background The Key Information Document (KID) for Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs) is a mandatory, three-page A4 information document to be provided to consumers before purchasing a PRIIP. PRIIPs include for example funds, structured products, unit-linked and with-profits life insurance contracts, and structured deposits. \t\u00a0 \tOn 1 October 2018, the ESAs wrote a letter to the European Commission expressing their concerns regarding the possibility of duplicating information requirements for investment funds from 1 January 2020 and the importance of legislative changes to avoid such a situation, including a targeted review of the PRIIPs Delegated Regulation. \t\u00a0 \tSubsequently, on 8 November 2018 the ESAs published a consultation paper proposing targeted amendments that would allow the KID to be applied to all types of investment funds and to address key issues that have arisen since the implementation of the KID, in particular concerning the performance scenarios. \t\u00a0 \tIn parallel with the ESAs' work, the European co-legislators also initiated discussions on legislative changes relating to the application of the KID by certain investment funds and the timing of a review of PRIIPs.\u00a0 When publishing the consultation paper, ESAs stated that they would take into account the latest information regarding these political discussions when deciding upon their final proposals.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe Supervisory Statement is issued under Article 29(2) of the ESAs' Regulations as a convergence tool to promote common supervisory approaches and practices. \t\u00a0 \tThe PRIIPs Regulation (No 1286/2014) defines the main rules and principles for KIDs.

The first one clarifies the notions of investments in venture capital firms and private equity, which the EBA has taken the initiative to provide for the purpose of these Guidelines only.

The reports cover credit risk for high and low default portfolios (LDPs and HDPs), as well as market risk. The results confirm previous findings, with the majority of risk-weights (RWs) variability explained by fundamentals. These benchmarking exercises, conducted by the EBA on an annual basis are a fundamental supervisory and convergence tool to address unwarranted inconsistencies and restoring trust in internal models. \tCredit Risk exercise \tThe credit risk report examines the different drivers leading to the observed dispersion across banks' models. Most of the results are broadly in line with previous exercises, with 50% of the difference in variability explained by the proportion of defaulted exposures in the portfolio and the portfolio mix. The remaining could be attributed to differences in collateralisation and other institution-specific factors, such as risk strategy and management practices, idiosyncratic portfolio features, modelling assumptions, client structure, as well as supervisory practices. This confirms previous findings that RWA variability can be explained, to a large extent, by looking at some measurable features of institutions' exposures. \tFor LDPs, the risk weight assessments of institutions on a set of common counterparties have been compared. When substituting the risk weight with that of the median institution, the resulting deviations would generally be below 10%. Furthermore, the variability in estimates has been stable in comparison with the 2017 benchmarking exercise. \tFor HDPs, the estimated values of probabilities of default (PD) and loss given defaults (LGD) have been compared with observed values, i.e. default rates and loss rates. The report presents evidence that the majority of institutions have conservative estimates, in particular when compared with the observed values for the latest year. In comparison with the 2016 exercise, both default and loss rates have decreased more than PD and LGD estimates in recent years, which is likely to reflect a general improvement in economic conditions. \tThe competent authorities performed an assessment of the internal models, which have been identified as outliers in this benchmarking exercise. In comparison with previous exercises, their monitoring activities are increasingly noticing issues identified by the EBA benchmarking exercise. The same conclusion holds for institutions' internal validations. This is reassuring and indicates that the increased regulatory and supervisory attention paid to internal models is contributing to the consistency of the RWA of internal models. \tMarket Risk exercise \tCompared to the previous exercise, the 2018 analysis shows a reduction in the dispersion in the initial market valuation (IMV) and risk measures. This improvement was expected and is mainly due to the simplification in the market risk benchmark portfolios. Some variability in the results persists, which mainly stems from different interpretations and heterogeneous market practices adopted by the firms. Some of these issues have been addressed, and the quality of the data has improved. \tFrom a risk factor perspective, interest rate portfolios exhibit a lower level of dispersion than the other asset classes, which is most likely due to the use of more consistent practices and assumptions that are more homogeneous across the banks when modelling interest rate risk. This finding confirms the conclusions drawn in last year's analysis. \tIn line with the previous exercises, a significant dispersion for all the risk measures is observed. More complex measures such as incremental risk charge (IRC) and all price risk (APR) show a higher level of dispersion. \tThis report has provided input for competent authorities on areas that may require their further investigation, such as IMV variability for some credit spread products. Supervisors should pay attention to the materiality of risk factors not in VaR and, in particular, not encompassed in the IRC models. \tNote to the editors \tThese annual benchmarking exercises contribute to the work the EBA is conducting for improving the regulatory framework, increase convergence of supervisory practices and, thus, restoring confidence in internal models. For credit risk internal models, the EBA has followed its roadmap for the implementation of the regulatory review of internal models. \tIn particular, the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the assessment methodology for internal ratings-based approach are a key component of the EBA's work to ensure consistency in models outputs and comparability of risk-weighted exposures. The EBA guidelines on the definition of default and the estimation of PD, LGD and the treatment of defaulted assets are other components of this review. \tIn parallel, the exercises provides a regular supervisory tool based on benchmarks to support competent authorities' assessments of internal models and produce comparisons with EU peers.

Typically, crypto-asset activities do not constitute regulated services within the scope of EU banking, payments and electronic money law, and risks exist for consumers that are not addressed at the EU level. Crypto-asset activities may also give rise to other risks, including money laundering. In light of these issues, the EBA recommends that the European Commission carry out further analysis to determine the appropriate EU-level response. The EBA also identifies a number of actions that it will take in 2019 to enhance the monitoring of financial institutions' crypto-asset activities and consumer-facing disclosure practices. \tCrypto-assets are a type of private financial asset that depend primarily on cryptography and distributed ledger technology as part of their perceived or inherent value. A wide range of crypto-assets exist, including payment/exchange tokens (for example, so-called virtual currencies (VCs)), investment tokens and tokens to access a good or service (so-called \u2018utility' tokens). Recognising the rapid evolution in the use of crypto-assets, the EBA examines in the report: \t\tthe application of current EU banking, payments, e-money and anti-money laundering laws to crypto-assets; \t\tcrypto-asset custodian wallet providers and crypto-asset trading platforms, building on the EBA's July 2014 Opinion on VCs; \t\tcredit institutions, investment firms, payment institutions and electronic money institutions' activities involving crypto-assets and regulatory and supervisory issues. \tThe relatively low level of crypto-asset activity currently observed in the EU does not appear to give rise to implications for financial stability. However, typically activities involving crypto-assets fall outside the scope of EU banking, payments and electronic money regulation and risks exist for consumers that are not addressed at the EU level. As a result of the development of national regulatory responses, divergences between the Member States are starting to emerge presenting risks to the level playing field. Market developments also point to the need for a further review of EU anti-money laundering legislation. \tFor these reasons, the EBA sets out in the report advice to the European Commission regarding the need for a comprehensive cost/benefit analysis, taking account of issues inside and outside the financial sector, to determine what, if any, action is required at the EU level at this stage. The EBA also advises the European Commission to take account of the October 2018 recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (and any further standards or guidance) regarding, in their terminology, \u2018virtual asset' activities, and to take steps where possible to promote consistency in the accounting treatment of crypto-assets. \tAdditionally, the EBA sets out a number of steps that it will take in 2019 to enhance the monitoring of institutions' crypto-asset activities and consumer-facing disclosure practices. \tThe EBA's Executive Director, Adam Farkas, said: \"The EBA's warnings to consumers and institutions on virtual currencies remain valid. The EBA calls on the European Commission to assess whether regulatory action is needed to achieve a common EU approach to crypto-assets. The EBA continues to monitor market developments from a prudential and consumer perspective.\" \tLegal basis and background \tThe report has been prepared pursuant to Article 9(4) of the EBA's Founding Regulation which mandates the Authority to establish a Committee on financial innovation \u2018which brings together all relevant competent national and supervisory authorities with a view to achieving a coordinated approach to the regulatory and supervisory treatment of new or innovative financial activities and providing advice for the Authority to present to the European Parliament, Council and the European Commission'. \tOn 20 December 2017, the European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA) received a letter from European Commission Vice President Dombrovskis requesting further work on crypto-assets. The March 2018 European Commission FinTech Action Plan and EBA FinTech Roadmap also envisage the need for further work in this area. To this end, the EBA has carried out in 2018 an assessment of the applicability and suitability of EU financial services law (within its sphere of responsibility) to crypto-assets, and the level of crypto-asset activity by credit institutions and investment firms (within the meaning of Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013), payment institutions (within the meaning of Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366) and electronic money institutions (within the meaning of Directive 2009/110/EC).

Together with the Risk Dashboard, the EBA published the results of its Risk Assessment Questionnaire, which includes the opinions of banks and market analysts on the risk outlook collected in autumn 2018. In the third quarter (Q3) of 2018, the Dashboard confirms improvements in both asset quality and capital ratios, while profitability remains subdued. European Banks' capital ratios remain high with a modest increase since Q2 2018. The CET1 ratio on a transitional basis increased from 14.5% in the last quarter to 14.7% in Q3 2018 as the result of both an increase in CET1 capital and a decrease in total risk exposures. Banks representing 99.6% of total assets have a CET1 ratio above 11%. The fully loaded CET1 ratio increased to 14.5% in Q3 2018. The quality of the EU banks' loan portfolio has improved further. In Q3 2018, the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans kept the downward trend and stood at 3.4%, its lowest level since the NPL definition was harmonised across European countries in 2014. The declining trend of the NPL ratio is due to the growth of total loans as well as due to the continuous decline of non-performing loans, which now stand at 714.3 EUR billion. Looking forward, banks expect further improvement in the quality of their portfolios, while market analysts seem to be more cautious on the asset quality outlook. Profitability in the EU banking sector needs to improve further. The average return on equity (RoE) has been stable at 7.2%, with the share of banks with RoE above 6% decreasing from 67.1% in Q2 to 62.8%. \u00a0The answers to the Risk Assessment Questionnaire show that banks expect profitability to remain subdued, with only about 30% with a positive outlook in the next 6-12 months. In order to improve profitability, banks target increasing fees and commission income and decreasing operating expenses. The loan to deposit ratio has remained broadly stable. In Q3 2018, the ratio increased marginally by 10bps to 118.4%, driven by a growing numerator as well as denominator. The leverage ratio (fully phased-in) remained stable at 5.1%. Asset encumbrance ratio increased slightly to 28.2% from 28% in Q2 2018. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) improved to 148.5% in Q3 2018, the highest value since Q3 2016 and well above the 100% requirement. Regarding funding, the Risk Assessment Questionnaire results show that two out of three responding banks plan to increase the issuance of MREL eligible instruments. However, around 50% of the banks consider challenges around pricing as the main constraint for such issuances. Analysts are confident that banks will be able to issue BRRD / MREL / TLAC eligible instruments and also agree that the costs for such issuances will rise in the upcoming period. Notes to editors \tThe figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 150 banks, covering more than 80% of the EU banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates may also include large subsidiaries (the list of banks can be found here https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data).

The report also identifies some areas for ongoing scrutiny and further work from an EBA perspective. \tMain observations \tThe objective of this new Report on IFRS9 implementation is to provide preliminary observations on the first stages of implementation of IFRS9 while a deeper analysis is still ongoing. \tBased on the data collected for the sample of banks, the actual negative day-one impact on CET1 (51 bps on simple average compared to 42 bps in the second impact assessment report from July 2017) and increase in provisions (9% on simple average compared to 13% in the second assessment report from July 2017) broadly confirm the previous estimations from the banks. In relation to the use of transitional arrangements mitigating the impact of IFRS9 on CET1 capital, the average CET1 impact resulting from the add-back of provisions for all the banks in the sample applying these transitional arrangements corresponds to 118 bps. \tIn addition, the EBA notes that the post-implementation review of IFRS9 is just starting and the effective impact of the standard, closely linked to the current and expected macroeconomic circumstances, as well as its implementation, will need to be reviewed through time. For this purpose, the EBA has developed a set of indicators using the supervisory reporting data that it intends to monitor on an ongoing basis. \tNext steps \tThe main observations from the report highlight some areas where the EBA thinks further scrutiny is necessary. These include better understanding the drivers for the observed impact on CET1, the quantitative and qualitative criteria used for transfers between stages as well as the use of IFRS 9 transitional arrangements. \tThe EBA will carry out further work on IFRS 9 modelling aspects to better understand the practices followed by banks and assess which aspects might merit further investigation. Greater attention may be given to banks under the standardised approach, given their lack of modelling experience. As a medium/long term action, the EBA will consider the possibility of conducting a benchmarking exercise, whose objective would be to understand to what extent the use of different methodologies, models, inputs and scenarios could lead to material inconsistencies in the expected credit loss outcomes between banks. \tIn addition to the above, the EBA will continue to closely monitor and follow up on the work currently on-going at the level of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) on the interaction between accounting expected credit loss models and regulatory provisions.

The EBA urges such institutions to take its Opinion into careful consideration and to swiftly proceed with advising customers on the specific implications stemming from the UK withdrawal from the EU. \tIn its follow-up monitoring of the June 2018 Opinion, the EBA has observed continued progress in contingency planning but little evidence of financial institutions communicating effectively to their customers on how they may be affected by the UK withdrawal and on any relevant actions undertaken by such institutions as part of their contingency planning that may affect those customers' contractual or statutory rights. \tThe EBA is therefore calling on all financial institutions affected by the UK withdrawal from the EU, directly or indirectly, to take the EBA June Opinion into careful consideration, and on that basis to engage with their customers and provide adequate information on the risks and mitigating measures being taken, and do so as soon as possible providing the customers at least with the information specified in the EBA June 2018 Opinion. \tThe EBA also notes that, should the customers that have concerns about whether they may be impacted by the UK withdrawal from the EU and that have not been contacted by their financial service provides by the end of 2018, they might wish to contact their financial institutions directly. \tBackground \tThe EBA's June 2018 Opinion focused on the risks posed by the seeming lack of adequate contingency preparations by financial institutions with a view to ensure that they (1) establish whether they have direct or indirect exposures to the UK, and (2) consider the risks concerned, and associated mitigating action and contingency plans. \tIn its Opinion, the EBA also asked competent authorities to engage with financial institutions to ensure that they have carefully assessed their obligations to (existing and prospective) customers, and taken any necessary actions to ensure the continuity of services in the light of their continuing contractual commitments. The EBA requested competent authorities to engage with financial institutions to ensure that they provide clear information to customers whose contracts or services may be affected, as soon as that information becomes available to them, and in any event no later than the end of 2018. \tSince the publication of the Opinion, the EBA has continued, together with supervisory and resolution authorities, to monitor institutions' progress in their contingency planning and customer communication. The EBA observes that there has been some progress by financial institutions in a number of areas. For example, more institutions are implementing contingency plans and the contingency plans themselves have advanced in substance too. In particular, more institutions are getting necessary licences and relocating their businesses and claim to have made progress in diversifying access to funding, introducing contractual bail-in clauses into newly issued MREL instruments and introducing contractual clauses to facilitate data transfers. \tThe EBA and supervisory and resolution authorities will continue to monitor contingency planning. While the main focus remains on financial stability and continuity of wholesale markets, notably derivatives, the EBA is also concerned over the preparations of smaller and less sophisticated institutions, in particular, payment institutions and e-money institutions, and their ex ante communication to customers who may be affected by the UK withdrawal from the EU in the absence of the ratified Withdrawal Agreement.

The report is accompanied by the results of the EBA's 2018 EU-wide transparency exercise, which provide detailed information, in a comparable and accessible format, for 130 banks across the EU. Overall, the EU banking sector has continued to benefit from the positive macroeconomic developments in most European countries, which contributed to the increase in lending, further strengthening of banks' capital ratios and improvements in asset quality. Profitability remains low on average and has not yet reached sustainable levels. EU banks' solvency ratios have increased, despite rising risk weighted assets (RWA) during the last two quarters. Since June 2017, CET1 ratios have increased from 14.3% to 14.5% on a transitional and from 14.0% to 14.3% on a fully loaded basis. The composition of capital keeps moving towards a greater reliance on retained earnings and other reserves. Asset quality has further improved. The average NPL ratio of EU banks has decreased from 4.4% in June 2017 to 3.6% in June 2018. It has reached its lowest level since the NPL definition was harmonised across the EU in 2014, when it stood at 6.5%. NPL sales have contributed significantly to these reductions. However, vulnerabilities from downside risks to economic growth, revival of protectionism and elevated political risk remain high, which might jeopardise banks' efforts to reduce legacy assets. Profitability has virtually not changed since last year with an average return on equity (RoE) at 7.2% as of June 2018. EU banks' net interest income has continued its declining trend in recent quarters, despite growing lending volumes, tightening the net interest margin further. Profitability has however benefited from the reduction of impairments and the increase of net fee and commission income. High costs and low efficiency represent a major driver of the poor performance of the EU banking sector. Costs dynamics are affected by elevated IT related expenses. \tDespite increasing stable customer deposit funding, banks are facing key challenges on the liability side. Replacing financing from central banks will be a key driver for banks' funding plans. Another driver are issuance needs of instruments for meeting the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). In developing and exercising their funding strategies banks should also be aware of the resurgence of market volatility and a potential upcoming interest rate increase. Operational risks in EU banks have again been on the rise. ICT-related risks are currently one of the main challenges for EU banks, with cyber risks and data security being the main drivers. At the same time, conduct and legal risks, including breach of anti-money laundering regulations, have been on the rise in 2018. \tLooking forward, risks to the global economy are increasing with growing geopolitical tensions, coupled with uncertainties surrounding financial and economic conditions in emerging markets economies. Banks need to be prepared for adverse scenarios, which might impact funding, asset quality and profitability. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-sees-further-improvements-in-eu-banks-resilience-but-highlights-challenges-connected-to-profitability-funding-and-operational-risk"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0478", "date": "2018-12-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA issues a call for expressions of interest to participate in its working group on APIs under PSD2", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) issued today a call for expressions of interest to participate in the its working group on Application Programming Interfaces under PSD2 (WG-API).

The draft RTS propose, in the context of the United Kingdom's (UK) withdrawal from the European Union (EU), to introduce a limited exemption in order to facilitate the novation of certain OTC derivative contracts to EU counterparties during a specific time-window. The amendments would only apply if the UK leaves the EU without the conclusion of a withdrawal agreement \u2013 a no deal scenario. The draft RTS complement the similar proposal published by ESMA on 8 November 1\u00a0 with respect to the clearing obligation. \tIn the context of the on-going withdrawal negotiations between the EU and the UK, and to address the situation where a UK counterparty may no longer be able to provide certain services across the EU, counterparties in the EU may want to novate their OTC derivative contracts by replacing the UK counterparty with an EU counterparty. However, by doing this, they may trigger the clearing obligation or the bilateral margin requirements for these contracts, therefore facing costs that were not accounted for when the contract was originally entered into. \tLimited exemption from the bilateral margin requirements to facilitate novations \tThe draft RTS allows UK counterparties to be replaced with EU ones without triggering the new procedures defined in the bilateral margin RTS. This limited exemption would ensure a level playing field between EU counterparties and the preservation of the regulatory and economic conditions under which the contracts where originally entered into. Its scope, time and intent are aligned with the draft RTS regarding the clearing obligation that ESMA published on 8 November. \tThe window for the novation of OTC derivative contracts which fall under the scope of this amending regulation and the one published by ESMA would be open for twelve months following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. Counterparties can however start repapering their contracts ahead of the application date, making the novation conditional upon a no-deal Brexit, given the conditional application date of these two amending regulations. \tParticipants Brexit preperations \tThe ESAs and other EU authorities and institutions have been clear on the importance for market participants to be prepared for Brexit, including the possibility of a no-deal scenario. These draft RTS provide regulatory solutions to support counterparties' Brexit preparations and to maintain a level playing field between EU counterparties, while addressing potential risks to orderly markets and financial stability. \tAs regards non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts, these two measures will be the only regulatory measures the ESAs intend to propose to help address the legal uncertainty raised by the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and to ensure a level-playing field between EU counterparties. \tCounterparties should start negotiating as soon as possible the novations of their transactions which are in the scope of these amending regulations, given the twelve month timeframe to benefit from it. Next steps \tThe draft RTS have been submitted to the European Commission for endorsement, and they are subject to the scrutiny of the European Parliament and of the Council. \tBackground Final Report \t\tCommission Delegated Regulation on the risk mitigation techniques for OTS derivatives not cleared at a CCP (No ) \t\tCommission Delegated Regulations on the clearing obligation (No 2015/2205, No 2016/592 and No 2016/1178). \t\tThe clearing obligation and bilateral margin requirements apply to EU firms that are counterparties to an OTC derivative contract including interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, credit and commodity derivatives. \t\t;The ESAs' mission is to enhance investor protection and promote stable and orderly financial markets. \t\tThe ESAs achieve this mission within the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) through active cooperation between the EBA, EIOPA, ESMA, the European Systemic Risk Board, and with national competent authorities. \t\u00a0 1 ESMA's publication regarding the clearing obligation is available at the following address: https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-proposes-regulatory-change-support-brexit-preparations-counterparties ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/esas-propose-to-amend-bilateral-margin-requirements-to-assist-brexit-preparations-for-otc-derivative-contracts"}, {"id": "EBA_NULL_0489", "date": "2018-11-16", "text_type": "NULL", "title": "EBA publishes final draft technical standards on the specification of an economic downturn", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) specifying the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn. These RTS complete\u00a0the EBA's regulatory review of the internal ratings-based (IRB) Approach, with the objective of restoring market participants' trust in internal models by reducing the unjustified variability in resulting risk weighted exposure amounts. The EBA is currently finalising the related Guidelines on the estimation of loss given default (LGD) appropriate for conditions of an economic downturn.The final draft RTS set out the notion of economic downturn to be taken into account when estimating the LGD and the conversion factors (CF). Given the specificities of the types of exposures covered by a rating system, the economic downturn should be identified separately for each rating system. However, as a rating system may cover exposures from different businesses, sectors and geographical areas, the notion of an economic downturn included in these RTS may comprise several disjunctive downturn periods (e.g. where a rating system covers two sectors which experienced downturn conditions in different periods of time).\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the final draft RTS specify the nature of an economic downturn via macroeconomic or credit-related factors (\u2018economic factors') that are explanatory variables or indicators for the business cycle of the considered type of exposure. The severity of an economic downturn is specified by the set of the most severe observations on the economic factors constituting the nature of an economic downturn, based on historical values of these factors over the last 20 years. The duration of an economic downturn is determined by the duration of the identified downturn periods and is generally specified as the 12-month period where the most severe values are observed. However, some flexibility is embedded in the draft policy to ensure that the severity and duration are appropriately specified. \u00a0 Legal basis, implementation and next stepsUnder the advanced IRB Approach, institutions determine their own funds requirements for credit risk taking into account their own LGD and CF estimates. According to Article 181(1)(b) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), institutions shall estimate LGDs that are appropriate for an economic downturn and according to Article 182 (1)(b) institutions shall estimate conversion factors that are appropriate for an economic downturn.Therefore, the EBA is mandated in Articles 181(3)(a) and 182(4)(a) to develop these draft RTS specifying the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn to be taken into account when estimating the LGD and CF.These draft RTS will apply from 1 January 2021. It should be noted that the Guidelines on the estimation of the probability of default (PD) and LGD, which will be complemented by the Guidelines on downturn LGD estimation, will apply as well from 1 January 2021. An earlier implementation of the Guidelines on downturn LGD estimation is, however, encouraged and Institutions should engage with their competent authorities at an early stage in order to determine an adequate implementation plan, including the timeline for the supervisory assessment and approval of material model changes, where necessary.

The draft Guidelines are part of the ESAs' wider work on fostering a common approach to AML/CFT within the EU. \tCooperation and exchange of information between competent authorities responsible for overseeing AML/CFT compliance of credit and other financial institutions is an essential part of an effective AML/CFT regime. EU AML/CFT legislation establishes an obligation for competent authorities to cooperate and exchange information, but it does not set out in detail how this should be achieved. \tRecent events have illustrated that in the absence of a common framework, cooperation and information exchange between prudential and AML/CFT competent authorities for the purposes of AML/CFT supervision can sometimes be difficult. To address this, the ESAs have agreed to develop these Guidelines, which clarify the practical modalities of this process both domestically and on a cross-border basis. \tThe Guidelines propose the creation of AML/CFT colleges of supervisors and set out the rules governing their establishment and operation. In particular, AML/CFT colleges should be set up whenever three or more competent authorities from different Member States are responsible for the AML/CFT supervision of the same credit or financial institution and its establishments, and the frequency and intensity of each AML/CFT college should be determined on a risk-sensitive basis. \tAs information available to AML/CFT supervisors may also be relevant for prudential supervisors and vice versa, the Guidelines propose gateways to ensure that prudential supervisors can participate as observers in AML/CFT colleges, and that information from AML/CFT college meetings is available to colleges of prudential supervisors.\u00a0 \tWhere the conditions for setting up an AML/CFT college are not met, the Guidelines propose that supervisors will continue their cooperation and information exchange on a bilateral basis and formalise this process.\u00a0 \tConsultation process \tComments to the draft Guidelines can be sent by clicking on the\u00a0\"send your comments\"\u00a0button on the EBA's consultation page.

The adverse scenario has an impact of -395 bps on banks' CET1 fully loaded capital ratio (-410 bps on a transitional basis), leading to a 10.1% CET1 capital ratio at the end of 2020 (10.3% on a transitional basis). The objective of the exercise is to assess, in a consistent way, the resilience of banks to a common set of adverse shocks. The results are an input to the supervisory decision-making process and promote market discipline. \tAs the central data hub for the entire EU, the EBA published the granular bank results, including detailed information at the starting and end point of the exercise, under both the baseline and the adverse scenarios. \tSummary of key results \tCommenting on the outcome of the exercise, Mario Quagliariello, Director of Economic Analysis and Statistics at the EBA, said: \"The outcome of the stress test shows that banks' efforts to build up their capital base in the recent years have contributed to strengthening their resilience and capacity to withstand the severe shocks and material capital impacts of the 2018 exercise. The results will be used by supervisors as part of their wider assessment of banks' vulnerabilities and input to their supervisory decisions\". \tImpact of IFRS 9 implementation \tOne of the main features of the 2018 exercise is the implementation of the IFRS 9. Banks provided the starting point according to actual figures at the end of 2017 and IFRS 9 restated figures. The negative impact of IFRS 9 first implementation on banks' aggregate common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio is -20 basis points (bps)* on a fully loaded basis, -10 bps on a transitional basis. \tImpact of the stress and its main drivers \tThe aggregate impact of the adverse scenario, measured as the difference between the starting CET1 ratios under the IFRS 9 restated positions and the CET1 ratios projected at the end of the stressed period, is -395 bps on a fully loaded basis (-410 bps on a transitional basis). At the end of 2020, in the adverse scenario, banks' aggregate CET1 capital ratio is 10.1% fully loaded (10.3% transitional). \tThe overall impact is due to a capital depletion of EUR 226bn, and to an increase of the total REA of EUR 1,049bn. Other specific risk drivers contributing to the overall impact on CET1 capital ratio on a fully loaded basis include: \t\tCredit risk losses of EUR 358bn contribute by -425 bps; \t\tOperational risk losses, including conduct risk, of EUR 82bn contribute by -100 bps; \t\tMarket risk losses, including CCR, of EUR 94bn and contribute by -110 bps. \tThe final CET1 capital ratio is also affected by the cumulative decrease of the main sources of banks' income over the adverse scenario compared to the starting point. \tThe 2018 EU-wide stress test does not contain a defined pass/fail threshold. However, the exercise is an important supervisory tool and an input for the Pillar 2 assessment of banks. The results of the stress test will assist Competent Authorities in assessing banks' ability to meet applicable prudential requirements under the stress scenario and form a solid ground for discussion between the supervisor and the individual banks. \tNotes to the editors \t\tThe EU-wide stress test is initiated and coordinated by the EBA and undertaken in cooperation with the Competent Authorities, the European Central Bank (ECB) and, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). \t\tThe EBA develops a common methodology and is responsible for the final dissemination of the outcome of the exercise. The adverse scenario is prepared by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) in collaboration with the ECB and the EBA, and the baseline scenario\u00a0is provided by the ECB. Competent Authorities, including the ECB Banking Supervision for the euro area banks, are responsible for ensuring that banks correctly apply the common methodology. In particular, they are responsible for assessing the reliability and robustness of banks' assumptions, data, estimates and results and the resulting supervisory actions. \t\tThe EU-wide stress test is a constrained bottom-up exercise. The main changes compared to the 2016 exercise are the revision of the credit risk methodology to cater for the implementation of IFRS 9 and the revision of the market risk methodology, which prescribes a common methodology for all fair value measurement portfolios under a single adverse scenario and includes specific provisions to stress L2 and L3 financial instruments. \t\tThe Report provides transitional and fully loaded solvency ratios. The latter are computed considering the full implementation of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) IV and IFRS 9. \t\u00a0 * All impact numbers in bps shown in the text of this report are rounded to the nearest 5bps. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-2018-eu-wide-stress-test-results"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0495", "date": "2018-10-31", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes final guidance on management of non-performing and forborne exposures", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) publishes today its final Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures. The Guidelines, developed in accordance with the European Council Action Plan, aim to ensure that credit institutions have adequate prudential tools and frameworks in place to manage effectively their non-performing exposures (NPEs) and to achieve a sustainable reduction on their balance sheets. To this end, the Guidelines require institutions to establish NPE reduction strategies and introduce governance and operational requirements to support them. \tThe Guidelines specify sound risk management practices for credit institutions in their management of NPEs and forborne exposures (FBEs), including requirements on NPE reduction strategies, governance and operations of NPE workout framework, internal control framework and monitoring. The Guidelines are written from a prudential perspective, but are also mindful of the pressing needs related to consumer protection to ensure that consumers are treated fairly. \tThe Guidelines also set out requirements for processes to recognise NPEs and FBEs, as well as a forbearance granting process with a focus on the viability of forbearance measures. In particular, the Guidelines specify that institutions should grant forbearance measures only with the view to return the borrower to a sustainable performing repayment status and are thus in the borrower's interest. \tThe Guidelines introduce a threshold of 5% of gross NPL ratio as a trigger for developing NPE strategies and applying associated governance and operational arrangements. This threshold does not indicate an optimal level for NPLs and should not be considered as an automatic target to be used in credit institutions' NPE strategies but sets a prudential framework for stricter supervisory monitoring to guard against rising levels of NPEs. \tFinally, the Guidelines outline requirements for competent authorities' assessment of credit institutions' NPE management activity as part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). \tThe Guidelines, which are addressed to credit institutions and supervisors, take into account the proportionality aspects in their implementation and, where applicable, provide concrete examples in relation to small and less complex institutions. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe EBA has developed these Guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and following the conclusions reached by the European Council in July 2017 specifying an Action Plan to tackle non-performing loans (NPLs) in Europe. In that respect, the Council has stressed that a comprehensive approach combining a mix of complementing policy actions, at national and European level, is needed to address the existing stock of NPLs as well as to prevent the emergence and accumulation of new NPEs on banks' balance sheets. \tThe Guidelines apply from 30 June 2019.

In the second quarter (Q2) of 2018, the updated Dashboard identified ongoing improvements in the repair of the EU banking sector but also residual risks in banks' profitability. European Banks' capital ratios remain high, in line with first quarter of 2018. The CET1 ratio remained at 14.5%, with a slight increase in the value of CET1 capital, accompanied by an increase in total risk exposures. CET1 ratios remained above 12% for all countries in the sample.\u00a0 Compared to the previous period, the fully loaded CET1 ratio stood stable at 14.3%. EU banks continue to improve overall quality of their loans' portfolio. In Q2 2018, the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans kept the downward trend and achieved a level of 3.6%, the lowest since the NPL definition was harmonised across European countries. Compared to the previous period, despite a slight decrease in the total value of the loans granted, the further decrease of NPLs (now 731 billion euros) allowed to keep the NPL downward trend. This trend is observed for all bank-size classes, but dispersion remains across EU countries (ratios between 0.66% and 44.6%). The coverage ratio is 46% in Q2 of 2018, compared to 46.5% in Q1 of 2018. Profitability remains a concern for the EU banking sector. When compared to Q1 of 2018, the average return on equity (ROE) rose in the second quarter from 6.8% to 7.2%. The heatmap shows an improvement in the share of total assets held by banks with ROE above 6%, now 67.1% compared to 64.1% in Q1 of 2018. The RoE's dispersion remains stable with the difference between the upper quartile (10.1%) and the lower quartile (4.0%) at 6.1%. Loan to deposit ratio reaches the lowest value since 2014. In Q2 of 2018, the ratio decreased to 116.2% when compared to 118.2% in the first quarter of 2018, mainly due to an increase in deposits. The leverage ratio (fully phased-in) remained at 5.1% when compared to Q1 2018. The asset encumbrance ratio decreased from 28.4% in Q1 2018 to 28% in Q2 2018. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) rose to 148.2% from 147% in the first quarter of 2018, remaining well above the 100% requirement. Notes to editors \tThe figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 150 banks, covering more than 80% of the EU banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates may also include large subsidiaries (the list of banks can be found here https://eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data). \tIFRS 9, which entered into force on 1 January 2018, may have had an impact on some of the ratios included in the dashboard.

The EBA Basel III capital monitoring report includes a preliminary assessment of the impact of the Basel reform package - as endorsed by the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHoS) - on EU banks assuming its full implementation. The report on liquidity measures monitors and evaluates the liquidity coverage requirements currently in place in the EU. The EBA estimates that the Basel III reforms would determine an average increase by 16.7% of EU banks' Tier 1 minimum required capital.\u00a0 The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of EU banks stood at around 145% in December 2017, materially above the minimum threshold of 100%. \t\u00a0 Basel III monitoring report \tThe Basel III monitoring report assesses the impact on EU banks of the final revisions of credit risk, operational risk, and leverage ratio frameworks, as well as of the introduction of the aggregate output floor. It also quantifies the impact of the new standards for market risk (FRTB), as set out in January 2016, and credit valuation adjustments (CVA).\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tOverall, the results of the Basel III capital monitoring, based on data as of 31 December 2017, show that European banks' minimum Tier 1 capital requirement would increase by 16.7% at the full implementation date. The impact of the risk-based reforms is 21.8%, of which the leading factors are the output floor (6.3%) and operational risk (5.7%).\u00a0 The leverage ratio is the constraining (i.e. the highest) Tier 1 requirement for some banks in the sample, explaining why part of the increase in the risk-based capital metric (-5.1%) is not to be accounted as an actual increase of the overall Tier 1 requirement.\u00a0\u00a0 \t\u00a0 Change in total Tier 1 minimum required capital, as percentage of the overall CRR/CRD IV minimum required capital, due to the full implementation of Basel III (2027), in % \t\u00a0 Source: EBA QIS data (December 2017) \t\u00a0 \t\tTo comply with the new framework, EU banks would need EUR 24.5 billion of total capital, of which EUR 6.0 billion of additional CET1 capital. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tThe current report provides a preliminary, high-level, impact of final Basel III reforms.

At the reporting date of 31 December 2017, EU banks' average LCR was 145% and the aggregate gross shortfall amounted to EUR 20.8 billion corresponding to four banks that monetised their liquidity buffers during times of stress. A more in-depth analysis of potential currency mismatches in LCR levels, suggests that banks tend to hold lower liquidity buffers in some foreign currencies, in particular US dollar.\u00a0 \t\t\tNotes to the editors \t\t\t\tThe results of the Basel III capital monitoring report are presented separately for Group 1 and Group 2 banks.

The reports aim to provide important information for EU supervisors to assess the sustainability of banks' main sources of funding. The results of the assessment show that banks plan to match the asset side increase in the forecast years by a growth in client deposits as well as market based funding. \t\u00a0 \t159 banks submitted their plans for funding over a forecast period of 3 years (2018 to 2020). According to the plans, total assets are projected to grow, on average, by 6.2% by 2020. The main drivers for asset growth are loans to households and to non-financial corporates.\u00a0 \tOver the forecast period, banks expect to increase client deposits and long-term debt funding while short-term debt and repo funding are expected to fall. The projected data shows a concentration of debt securities issuances in 2019 and 2020. Most likely, these issuances are driven by the conjunction of the maturities of central bank funding and the nearing timeline for G-SIBs to comply with the total loss absorption capacity requirements (TLAC) and the progress in the implementation of the minimum requirements for eligible liabilities (MREL).\u00a0 \tData also shows that the spread between interest rates for client deposits and for loans to clients declined in 2017 and most banks expect the spread to decline even further in 2018. On the cost of funding, banks seem optimistic as they assume their costs of long-term market-based funding in 2018 will remain at 2017 levels. Amid higher competition and a fading support by central banks, the evolution of banks' interest spread and market-based funding costs should be closely monitored, in particular for those banks that are under pressure to increase profitability or without access to market-based funding at reasonable rates. \tAsset encumbrance increased slightly in 2017 \tThe asset encumbrance report shows that in December 2017 the overall weighted average asset encumbrance ratio stood at 27.9%, compared to 26.6% in 2016. The modest increase of the encumbrance ratio is not an issue of immediate concern in the funding structure of EU banks, as it is mostly driven by a reduced volume of total assets as opposed to an increase in encumbered assets. The report shows a wide dispersion across institutions and countries, which is consistent with what was observed in the previous report. \tBesides repos, covered bonds and over-the-counter derivatives are among the main source of asset encumbrance. Banks in countries that were more affected by the sovereign debt crisis still have high levels but have shown a decrease in the volume of encumbrance, which could reflect a general improvement in the funding situation in these countries.\u00a0 \tNotes to editors \tThe two reports issued today are based on banks' data submissions in accordance with the EBA's guidelines on funding plans and technical standards on asset encumbrance.

The Report summarises the EBA's assessment of the quality of the colleges' organisation, discussions held and general output. Overall, the Report finds that good progress has been achieved since the introduction of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) in 2015, also considering that most colleges are only in their second year of operation. However, the Report also notes that resolution is a complex matter which requires further progress and continued effort to ensure college members are well prepared to deal with the failure of a cross-border bank.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe Report found that in 2017, resolution authorities were broadly compliant with the regulations regarding the operational aspects of colleges. In particular, their level of engagement has progressively intensified and they have managed to meet most of the deadlines for reaching joint decisions. Nevertheless, there remain scope for improvement. The EBA stresses that colleges meetings are required to take place at least once a year, that resolution planning information should be properly circulated ahead of the meetings and that minutes should be promptly shared with members after the meetings. \t\u00a0 \tThe quality of the observed discussions has improved over the last two years with noticeably greater contribution from host authorities. However, the Report identifies that the quality varied between meetings and that additional progress is needed in some important areas, such as the interlinkages between recovery and resolution. \t\u00a0 \tAlso, the quality of college outputs has improved. In 2017, the college members discussed and reached joint decisions on resolution plans and resolvability assessments as well as on consolidated MREL for most of the colleges monitored. In addition, the EBA observed progress on the removal of impediments, with banks building up their levels of MREL-eligible debt as well as making progress in the inclusion of robust resolution clauses in their contracts for critical services. \t\u00a0 \tNonetheless, more remains to be done to ensure college members are prepared for highly stressed situations. In particular, the Report identifies that, (i) most resolution plans need further improvement in some key operational aspects; (ii) progress is needed in removing impediments to resolvability and, (iii) MREL needs to be set at solo level to ensure an adequate distribution of loss-absorbing capacity within groups. \tNote to the editors\u00a0 \tResolution colleges are fora for ongoing interactive engagement between relevant authorities (e.g. home and host resolution authorities, supervisors, finance ministries, administrators of deposit guarantee schemes) in order to plan and be ready to execute the effective resolution of cross-border banking groups.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tJoint decisions on resolution plans, impediment to resolvability and MREL are core deliverables of the resolution college work, as required by the BRRD. \t\u00a0 \tIn line with its mandate to promote the efficient, effective and consistent functioning of resolution colleges across the EU, the EBA monitored the activities of 13 colleges established for large cross-border banking groups. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-sees-progress-in-the-functioning-of-resolution-colleges-in-2017-but-continued-effort-is-needed"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0519", "date": "2018-07-31", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA updates the Joint Committee Guidelines on complaints-handling to extend their scope of application", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today an update to the Joint Committee (JC) Guidelines on complaints-handling, which includes an extension of their scope of application to the authorities supervising the new institutions established under the revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2) and the Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD). This extension will ensure that an identical set of requirements for complaints-handling continues to apply to all financial institutions across the banking, investment and insurance sectors. This will provide consumers with the same level of protection, irrespective of which regulated product or service they are purchasing and which regulated institution they are purchasing it from. \t\u00a0 \tThe JC Guidelines are addressed to authorities competent in their jurisdictions for supervising complaints-handling by firms, which in the banking sector include credit institutions, payment institutions and electronic money institutions, as defined in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), the PSD2 and the Electronic Money Directive (EMD) respectively. \tThe scope of the application of the JC Guidelines will be extended as of 1 May 2019 to the authorities competent for supervising complaints-handling by: \t\u00a0 \t\tPayment initiation service providers, which provide only payment initiation services; \t\tAccount information service providers (AISPs) benefiting from an exemption under Article 33 of PSD2, which provide only account information services; \t\tCredit intermediaries under the MCD;\u00a0 \t\tNon-credit institution creditors under the MCD. \t\u00a0 \tIn the specific case of AISPs, which provide only account information services, but no other payment services, the EBA, in line with related requirements set out in the PSD2, confirmed that the Guidelines will apply only to security-related complaints. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA also clarified that all credit intermediaries should inform consumers about the procedures for submitting a complaint, although competent authorities should consider a general proportionality principle when applying the JC Guideline to credit intermediaries that are sole traders.

In addition, it puts forward recommendations on key aspects for the European Commission to consider when possibly designing the legislative framework forSME ESNs. \tSME ESNs, similar to covered bonds, could be structured as a dual recourse instrument. Due to the high-risk profile of SME exposures, the EBA suggests a more restrictive framework, especially with respect to the coverage, the liquidity and the disclosure requirements and suggests strict eligibility criteria at both loan and pool level and a minimum level of over-collateralisation of at least 30%. In terms of capital requirement, it is advised that no preferential treatment (i.e. similar to covered bonds) is granted.

In the first quarter of 2018, the updated dashboard identified ongoing improvements in the repair of the EU banking sector but also residual risks in banks' profitability. European banks' capital ratios remained high, albeit with a slight decrease in the first quarter of 2018. The CET1 ratio experienced a decrease of 50 bps, from 14.9% to 14.4% in Q1 2018, mainly driven by a decrease in CET1 capital (\"retained earnings\"), also linked to the adoption of the new accounting framework (IFRS9). Compared to the previous quarter, the fully loaded CET1 ratio decreased by 40 bps to 14.2% and the total capital ratio by 40 bps to 18.7%. EU banks continued to improve the overall quality of their loans' portfolio. In Q1 2018, the average ratio of non-performing loans (NPL) continued its downward trend, reaching its lowest level since Q4 2014 (3.9%). This result is jointly explained by an increase in the outstanding volume of loans granted and a decrease of NPLs by almost 1/3 in 3 years, from over EUR 1.12 trillion to EUR 779.2 billion. Despite the progress, additional efforts are still needed to reduce the volume of legacy assets. Profitability remains a concern for the EU banking sector. On a year-on-year comparison, the average ROE decreased by 50 bps to 6.8% in Q1 2018, mainly driven by the annual decrease in net trading income (4.5 p.p. to 5.6% in Q1 2018). The low profitability and widespread dispersion for some countries (with the ROE ranging from 0.7% to 19.1%), along with high operating costs, continues to dampen the profitability prospects for the European banking sector as a whole. However, the results of the EBA Risk Assessment Questionnaire show that banks, as well as market analysts, expect a slight improvement in profitability of banks in the near future. This is expected to be driven partly by increasing fees and commission income and decreasing operating expenses. The loan-to-deposit ratio remained broadly stable, reaching 118.5% with an increase of 100 bps from the previous quarter. The leverage ratio (fully phased-in) decreased by 30 bps from 5.4% (Q4 2017) to 5.1% (Q1 2018), reflecting the impact of the new accounting framework (IFRS 9). In March, the average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 147.0%, well above the threshold defined as the liquidity coverage requirement for 2018 (100%). Regarding the future of EU banks' funding, the results of the EBA Risk Assessment Questionnaire suggest that going forward, banks expect to target mainly retail deposits and attain more instruments eligible for MREL, even though they consider the uncertainty on the specific MREL requirements as a constraint to their issuance. \tThe results of the Risk Assessment Questionnaire also show that cyber risk and data security are considered as the main drivers for the increase in operational risk. They are also assumed to be the main factors that might negatively influence market sentiment, along with geopolitical uncertainties including the UK's decision to leave the EU. \tNotes to editors \tThe figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 152 banks, covering more than 80% of the EU banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates may also include large subsidiaries (the list of banks can be found here https://eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data). The Q1 2018 EBA Risk Dashboard includes, for the first time, the figures for Icelandic banks. \tIFRS 9, which entered into force on 1 January 2018, may have had an impact on some of the ratios included in the dashboard.

In particular, the EBA's preliminary enquiry on the FIAU aimed at understanding the extent to which its approach to AML/CFT supervision and enforcement in relation to Pilatus Bank Limited had been effective and in line with Union law.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tOn 23 May 2018, the EBA Chairperson, having consulted with the Alternate Chairperson, opened an investigation into a possible BUL by the Maltese FIAU.

Therefore, the EBA called on the FIAU to adopt recommendations aimed at addressing the identified shortcomings. In particular, the EBA asked the FIAU to take actions to systematically assess the ML/TF risk associated with the Maltese financial sector; to supervise the effectiveness of the AML/CFT policies and procedures put in place by the obliged entities; to ensure enough resources are available and robust procedures are in place to supervise its obliged entities. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe Recommendation has been issued in accordance with Article 17 of the EBA's Founding Regulation regarding the BUL powers conferred to the Authority in case of non-compliance with Union law by competent authorities.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn accordance with the second paragraph of Article 17(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, the FIAU shall inform the EBA within 10 working days of receipt of this recommendation of the steps it has taken or intends to take to ensure compliance with Union law. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA's preliminary enquiries in relation to the MFSA are still ongoing. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-issues-recommendation-to-the-maltese-financial-intelligence-analysis-unit-in-relation-to-its-supervision-of-pilatus-bank"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0531", "date": "2018-07-10", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA peer review shows competent authorities have robust and consistent procedures to comply with RTS on passport notifications", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today the final peer review Report on the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the information to be notified when exercising the right of establishment and the freedom to provide services for credit institutions. The Report, which summarises the main findings of the peer review exercise, showed that competent authorities have developed consistent and robust procedures to comply with the RTS requirements although the level of sophistication of these processes varies across Member States. The EBA has, therefore, identified some best practices, which might be beneficial to address some of the identified weaknesses. \t\u00a0 \tThis peer review aimed to assess how effectively and efficiently competent authorities managed the passporting process and how they dealt with mandatory information received from credit institutions. In this regard, the peer review focused on the quality assurance process and paid great attention to how timely competent authorities handled credit institutions' information and assessed completeness and granularity of this information.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tOverall, the peer review revealed that competent authorities applied the provisions of the RTS correctly thanks to consistent and robust procedures they have developed to comply with the RTS requirements and to deal with passport notifications within the required timeframe.

Both reports fall under the wider context of the newly established EBA FinTech Knowledge Hub and aim to raise awareness within the supervisory community and the industry on potential prudential risks and opportunities from current and potential FinTech applications and understand the main trends that could impact incumbents' business models and pose potential challenges to their sustainability.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tReport on the impact of FinTech on incumbent credit institutions' business models\u00a0 \tBased on the EBA's observations, incumbents are categorised into (i) proactive/front-runners, (ii) reactive and (iii) passive in terms of the level of adoption of innovative technologies and overall engagement with FinTech. Potential risks may arise both for incumbents not able to react adequately and timely, remaining passive observers, but also for aggressive front-runners that alter their business models without a clear strategic objective in mind, backed by appropriate governance, operational and technical changes.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe report sets out five factors that might significantly affect incumbents' business models from a sustainability perspective: (i) digitalisation/innovation strategies pursued to keep up with the fast-changing environment, (ii) challenges arising from legacy ICT systems, (iii) operational capacity to implement the necessary changes, (iv) concerns over retaining and attracting staff and (v) increasing risk of competition from peers and other entities.\u00a0 \tThe report concurs that currently the predominant type of relationship between incumbents and FinTech is partnership with FinTech firms, which is considered a \"win-win\" situation. \tReport on the prudential risks and opportunities arising for institutions from FinTech \tThe report assesses seven use cases, where new technologies are applied or considered to be applied to existing financial processes, procedures and services.

The draft Guidelines provide a clear definition of outsourcing and specify the criteria to assess whether or not an outsourced activity, service, process or function (or part of it) is critical or important.\u00a0In particular, the revised Guidelines cover credit institutions and investment firms subject to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), but also payment institutions subject to the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and electronic money institutions subject to the e-money Directive. The consultation runs until 24 September 2018. \t\u00a0 \tOver the recent years, there has been an increasing tendency by institutions to outsource activities in order to reduce costs and improve flexibility and efficiency. In the context of digitalisation and increasing importance of information technology (IT) and financial technologies (FinTech), financial institutions are adapting their business models, processes and systems to embrace such technologies. Outsourcing to cloud service providers gained rapidly importance in many industries. Overall, IT has become one of the most prevalent outsourced activities. Outsourcing is also relevant in the context of gaining or maintaining access to the EU financial market. In particular, third country institutions may set up subsidiaries or branches in the EU in order to get or maintain access to EU financial markets and infrastructures, while the parent institution would provide a material part of the business activities.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe revised Guidelines deal with the responsibilities of the management body for the establishment of an appropriate framework for outsourcing, its implementation and application in a group, the due diligence process and risk assessment before entering in such arrangements. The Guidelines also clarify aspects related to the contractual arrangements, the monitoring and documentation of outsourcing arrangements as well as the supervision by competent authorities. \t\u00a0 \tAgainst this background, the Guidelines specify that the responsibility of the institution's management body can never be outsourced. Outsourcing must not lead to a situation where an institution becomes a so-called \u2018empty shell' that lacks the substance to remain authorised. Institutions must remain able to oversee all risks and to manage outsourcing arrangements. Institutions should be able to effectively control, challenge the quality and performance of outsourced processes, services and activities, and carry out their own risk assessment and ongoing monitoring.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe\u00a0 Guidelines set up a framework for the due diligence process of institutions with the objective of ensuring that functions are only outsourced to reliable service providers so that the ongoing provision of services and compliance with regulatory requirements is ensured. Institutions must ensure audit and access rights in written outsourcing agreements both for themselves and for competent authorities and are required to maintain a register of all outsourcing arrangements.\u00a0 \tConsultation process \tComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

The EBA Staff Papers series will make available selected studies on financial regulation, supervisory policy and legal issues of general interest with the aim of stimulating discussion and public debate.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe Executive Director in welcoming the launch of the EBA Staff Papers series said: \"Staff papers will be an important vehicle for the dissemination of research done by our staff and will contribute to the public debate in the supervisory and regulatory community and among a wide range of stakeholders\". \t\u00a0 \tThe first two papers included in the series are: \"Sharing the Pain? Credit Supply and Real Effects of Bank Bail-ins\", co-authored by EBA staff member Samuel Da Rocha Lopes with Thorsten Beck and F. Silva from the Cass Business School, and \"Identification of EU banks' business models\" co-authored by EBA staff members Marina Cernov and Teresa Urbano. \t\u00a0 \tThe paper \"Sharing the Pain? Credit Supply and Real Effects of Bank Bail-ins\" analyses the credit supply and real sector effects of bank bail-ins and raises a fundamental follow-up question, which is a source of concern among regulators and policy-makers, particularly in Europe:\u00a0 could more exposed firms compensate the credit supply tightening by accessing funds from other banks less affected by the shock, and were there any real effects associated with the intervention?\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe authors show that firms more exposed to the bail-in did not suffer a reduction of overall credit after the intervention when compared to less exposed firms. While banks more exposed to the bail-in significantly reduced credit supply at the intensive margin, affected firms compensated the overall credit tightening with other sources of funding. This issue is particularly important in the context of SMEs, which rely significantly on existing banking relationships. \t\u00a0 \tThe paper \"Identification of EU banks' business models\" proposes a standardised classification of business models of EU banks. The work is based on a rich and unique dataset collected for the first time for the full population of EU banks at individual level. The proposed classification approach combines both a qualitative and a quantitative component. The qualitative component is based on an expert knowledge of the supervisory authority, which is confirmed or challenged by quantitative indicators. The business model categorisation can provide the supervisory and regulatory authorities with a benchmark for classifying institutions for a more structured and consistent approach to regulatory impact assessment, analysing trends and risks, proportionality, and supervision. \tNote to the editors \tThe views expressed in the staff papers are those of the EBA staff members and do not represent the views of the EBA or of its Board of Supervisors.

The consultation runs until 19 September 2018. \t\u00a0 \tIn order to expand the use of the Securitisation Internal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA), that sits now at the top of the hierarchy of approaches for calculating capital requirements of securitisation positions, the CRR amendment accompanying the Securitisation Regulation introduces the possibility of using the provisions that normally apply to purchased receivables under the general IRB credit risk framework. This way, institutions may calculate the KIRB, and the corresponding risk parameters, (probability of default - PD - and loss given default - LGD), under the provisions of the purchased receivables and then use them as input in the SEC-IRBA, along with other information on the securitisation position.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThis draft RTS specify the conditions under which institutions may use the provisions on purchased receivables to make them fully workable in the context of securitisation transactions.

These changes form part of the EBA reporting framework version 2.8, which will be applicable for submissions of data as of December 2018.Amendments to the ITS on supervisory reportingThe final draft ITS amending the European Commission's Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 on supervisory reporting aim to keep reporting requirements in line with changes in the regulatory framework and with the evolving needs for Supervisory Authorities' risk assessments. The updated ITS include:new information on prudent valuation for fair-valued items and supplementary information on credit risk,high-level information on securitisation subject to the revised securitisation framework introduced by Regulation (EU) 2017/2401 amending the CRR and revised information on selected Pillar 2 items (COREP) andQ&A- based changes and other minor amendments.New ITS on resolution reporting requirementsThe final draft ITS on reporting requirements for the purposes of drawing up and implementing resolution plans will replace the European Commission's implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1066, and bring about the following changes:\u00a0A clearer scope of application of the minimum resolution framework by laying down a minimum set of data points to be reported by all institutions across the EU. Under certain conditions, resolution authorities will be able to waive some or all reporting requirements or to ask for additional data.Detailed minimum procedural requirements at least on an annual basis, by end of May in 2019 and by end of April from 2020 onwards.Revamped templates in line with the latest experience availableA full set of technical annexes to facilitate integration into banks' business processes and automation. For the first time, resolution reporting requirements are integrated in the EBA's single data point model, backed by validation rules and optional taxonomies.\u00a0By default, all data under this framework will continue to be submitted by banks to resolution authorities. In line with the applicable law, supervisory authorities may collect information on behalf of resolution authorities. Supervisors and resolution authorities will also cooperate and if information is already available to the supervisors, they may exempt institutions from submitting that data. In such case, they will inform institutions accordingly.Technical package for version 2.8 of the reporting frameworkThe documents published today include the following:\u00a0\u00a0A set of XML files forming the XBRL taxonomy; A description of the architecture of the XBRL taxonomy;\u00a0A DPM data dictionary database along with a DPM table layout and data point categorisation;\u00a0A list of validation rules.\u00a0Cooperation with the Single Resolution Board (SRB)The EBA has cooperated closely with the SRB with regard to the reporting on resolution. The 2.8 version of the reporting framework also contains, for practical reasons, additional information required by the SRB beyond the minimum framework established in EBA ITS on resolution reporting requirements. An integrated DPM and an integrated XBRL taxonomy covering both the minimum data set, as defined by the EBA ITS, and the additional data points, as defined by the SRB, are provided to contain and avoid duplicate reporting by institutions under the SRB jurisdiction. The SRB's additional requirements are under the SRB's responsibility and any question related to it should be addressed directly to them. Please see the following link for more information: https://srb.europa.eu/en/content/liability-data-reportApplicabilityReports with reference dates as of 31 December 2018 onwards are to use the new taxonomy set (2.8), which is related to the April 2018 framework release for the ITS on Supervisory Reporting and the ITS on resolution reporting.Background and legal basisThe EBA is required to develop ITS specifying supervisory reporting in the areas of own funds, financial information, losses stemming from lending collateralised by immovable property, large exposures, leverage ratio, liquidity ratios, asset encumbrance, additional liquidity monitoring metrics and supervisory benchmarking. These ITS are adopted by the EU Commission in the form of Implementing Regulations. The present publication comes as an update to the Regulation (EU) No 680/2014.\u00a0The EBA is required under Article 11(3) of the BRRD to develop draft implementing technical standards to specify procedures and a minimum set of standard forms and templates for the provision of information necessary to draw up and implement resolution plans. The new draft ITS will replace Regulation (EU) 2016/1066.\u00a0The taxonomy defines a representation for data collection under the reporting requirements as defined by EBA technical standards and guidelines. As part of enhancing regulatory harmonisation in the EU banking sector and facilitating cross-border supervision, uniform data definitions and formats are necessary to enable comparable data on credit institutions and investment firms across the EU. Although the EBA XBRL taxonomy was primarily developed for data transmission between Competent Authorities and the EBA, many authorities have been using it for the collection of supervisory reporting from the institutions they supervise. In this respect, the EBA taxonomy will lead to greater efficiency and convergence of reporting and the usage of a common data dictionary will enhance the supervisory practices across Members States.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-amended-technical-standards-on-supervisory-and-resolution-reporting-for-eu-institutions-and-the-corresponding-dpm-and-xbrl-taxonomy-2-8"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0565", "date": "2018-04-12", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EU financial regulators warn against risks for EU financial markets, Brexit, asset repricing and cyber-attacks key risks", "text": " \t\t\tRelated documents: Joint Committee Risk Report - Spring 2018 [PDF, 134KB] \t\t\tRelated links: Joint Committee Risk Assessment Reports \tThe securities, banking and insurance sectors\u00a0 in the European Union (EU) face multiple risks, the latest report on risks and vulnerabilities by the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) shows. The ESA report for the second half of 2017 outlines the following risks as potential sources of instability:\u00a0 \t\tsudden repricing of risk premia as witnessed by the recent spike in volatility and associated market corrections; \t\t\u00a0 \t\tuncertainties around the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU; and \t\t\u00a0 \t\tcyber-attacks.\u00a0 \tThe ESA report also reiterates their warning to retail investors investing in virtual currencies and raises awareness for risks related to climate change and the transition to a lower-carbon economy. \t\u00a0 \tIn light of the ongoing risks and uncertainties, especially those around Brexit, supervisory vigilance and cooperation across all sectors remains key. Therefore, the ESAs advise the following policy actions by European and national competent authorities as well as financial institutions:\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \t\tAgainst the backdrop of the potential for sudden risk premia reversals, supervisory stress testing remains a crucial tool for the management of systemic risk \u2013 these tests are to ensure that systemically relevant sectors and players are safe to withstand market shocks, such as insurance and occupational pensions sectors, central counterparties (CCP), banks and in the future asset managers;\u00a0 \t\t\u00a0 Brexit: the ESAs recommend EU financial institutions and their counterparties, as well as investors and retail consumers, to consider timely mitigation actions to prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the EU \u2013 including possible relocations and actions to address contract continuity risks;\u00a0 \t\t\u00a0 Cyber security: the ESAs encourage financial institutions to improve fragile IT systems, explore inherent risks to information security, connectivity and outsourcing. To support this, the ESAs will continue addressing cyber risks for securities, banking and insurance markets and monitor firms' use of cloud computing and potential build-up of cyber risks; and\u00a0\u00a0 \t\t\u00a0 Climate change: the ESAs recommend financial institutions to consider sustainability risk in their governance and risk management frameworks and to develop responsible, sustainable financial products \u2013 moreover, supervisors should enhance their analysis of potential risks related to climate change for the financial sector and financial stability.\u00a0 \tBackground \tThe Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering.

The data shows that in 2016, the number of high earners in EU banks receiving a remuneration of more than EUR 1 million decreased by 10.6% (from 5 142 in 2015 to 4 597 in 2016). In addition, for high earners, the average ratio between the variable and fixed remuneration continued to decrease from 127% in 2014 to 118% in 2015 and 104% in 2016. The same holds true for the ratio between the variable and fixed remuneration of all other identified staff, which decreased from 65.5 % in 2014 to 62.2 % in 2015 and 57.1 % in 2016. The report is part of the EBA's monitoring activities and focuses on the identification of staff, the application of deferral arrangements, the pay out in instruments and the use of specific remuneration elements, e.g. guaranteed variable remuneration and severance payments.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe lower number of high earners, receiving remuneration of more than EUR 1 million, was mainly driven by changes in the exchange rate between EUR and GBP, which led to a reduction of staff income paid in GBP when expressed in EUR. \t\u00a0 \tThe number of individuals whose professional activities have a material impact on an institution's risk profile (\u2018identified staff') and who are identified in accordance with the criteria set out in the EBA's regulatory technical standards (RTS) on identified staff, decreased significantly from 67 802 in 2015 to 53 382 in 2016 (-21.3%). In 2016, only 2.00% of staff in institutions were \u2018identified staff', which is a significant decrease compared to 2.42% in 2015. The EBA will look into the identification process when reviewing the application of the RTS on identified staff. \t\u00a0 \tOverall, the Report observes that following the introduction of a limitation of the ratio between the variable and the fixed remuneration to 100% (200% with shareholders' approval, where implemented by the Member State), the average effective ratio between the variable and fixed component for all identified staff continued to decrease to 57.1% in 2016 (2015: 62.2% and 2014: 65.5%). \t\u00a0 \tIn many institutions, the variable remuneration for all staff is lower than the amount distributed to shareholders. However, some institutions paid out larger amounts of variable remuneration despite the fact that only a relatively low amount was distributed to shareholders.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tAs in previous years, the Report shows that remuneration practices within institutions were not sufficiently harmonised. In particular, the application of deferral and pay out in instruments differed significantly across Member States and institutions. This is mainly due to differences in the national implementation that in many cases allow for waivers of these provisions when certain criteria are met. To address this issue, the EBA published, already in 2015, an Opinion on the application of proportionality in the area of remuneration . \tLegal basis, background and next steps \tThis Report has been developed in accordance with Article 75 (paragraphs 1 and 3) of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD IV), which mandates the EBA to use the data disclosed by institutions to benchmark remuneration trends and practices and to collect information on the number of individuals per institution that are remunerated EUR one million or more per financial year (\u2018high earners') in pay brackets of EUR one million, including the business area involved and the main elements of salary, bonus, long-term award and pension contribution. \t\u00a0 \tThis report contains both an analysis of the 2016 data reported for high earners and an analysis of the 2015 and 2016 remuneration benchmarking data, containing information on all identified staff. The analyses have been kept separate. However, in the remuneration benchmarking analysis, a few references to the high earners data are included for analytical reasons. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA will continue to benchmark remuneration trends every two years.\u00a0 For the performance years 2017 and 2018, the EBA will publish a benchmarking Report at the beginning of 2019.

Following the ESRB recommendation on commercial real estate markets, the EBA's Risk Dashboard has an additional page showing the aggregated real estate exposures referred to real estate activities and the construction sector.\u00a0European banks continued to strengthen their capital ratios in the last quarter of 2017. The CET1 ratio increased by 20 bps, from 14.6% in Q3 2017 to 14.8% in Q4 2017, reaching a new peak since Q4 2014. CET1 ratios are now above 11% for all institutions in the sample. The increase of capital ratios was driven by a decrease of the total risk exposures amount (mostly for credit risk).\u00a0EU banks continued to improve the overall quality of their loans' portfolio. In Q4 2017, the average ratio of non-performing loans (NPL) to total loans continued its downward trend, reaching its lowest level since Q4 2014 (4.0%). This result is explained by an increase in the outstanding volume of loans granted and a decrease in the overall amount of NPLs by over 1/3 in 3 years, from over 1.12 trillion Euros to 813 billion Euros. Nevertheless, the widespread dispersion among EU countries (with ratios ranging from 0.7% to 44.9%), along with the still high amount of NPLs in banks' balance sheet, remains a vulnerability for the European banking sector as a whole.\u00a0\u00a0Profitability remains the key challenge for the EU banking sector. The average return on equity (ROE) decreased from 7.2% (Q3 2017) to 6.1% in Q4 2017, showing its usual seasonality per year-end. On a year-on-year comparison, the average ROE rose by 2.8 p.p. from its lowest level of 3.3% in Q4 2016, mainly driven by the annual increase in net trading income (8.5% in Q4 2017). However, the return on equity remains below the cost of equity with legacy assets, cost-efficiency and banks' business models still being some of the main obstacles towards reaching sustainable profitability levels.\u00a0Loan-to-deposit ratio continued to decrease, reaching 116.7% with a 50 bps decline from the previous quarter, mainly driven by an increase in deposits. The leverage ratio remained broadly stable, increasing by 10 bps to 5.5%.Notes to editorsThe figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 149 banks, covering approximately 90% of the EU banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates may also include large subsidiaries.

In order to do so, the EBA carried out a mapping of such provisions for the techniques, eligibility and methods of the CRM available to institutions under the Standardised Approach (SA) and the Foundation-IRB (F-IRB) Approach. The mapping is supplemented by a quantitative overview of the institutions' use of the CRM framework, as well as a series of policy proposals for the consideration of the Commission, with a view to ensuring a proper and harmonised application of the current CRR provisions on the CRM framework through the necessary amendments to the Regulation. \t\u00a0 \tOne of the aspects highlighted in the Report, for the consideration of the Commission, is the limited guidance provided in the current CRR provisions on CRM under the Advanced-IRB (A-IRB) Approach. Also in line with the feedback received from the industry, the EBA has committed to provide further guidance on the application of CRM provisions to institutions using the A-IRB Approach. A set of guidelines detailing the use of current CRM provisions for A-IRB banks would be particularly useful to help eliminate the remaining significant differences in approaches in the area of CRM either due to different supervisory practices or bank-specific choices. \t\u00a0 \tThe Report also re-iterates the EBA's position regarding the three mandates for technical standards in the area of credit risk mitigation (CRM) identified in the CRR. These include the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the recognition of conditional guarantees, the RTS on liquid assets and the RTS on the internal models approach for master netting agreements. More precisely, the EBA believes that these three mandates only cover specific aspects of the regulatory framework, which are not expected to have a significant impact on the calculation of capital requirements for credit risk by institutions nor on their rating systems. Fulfilling these three mandates, instead of undertaking an analysis of the overall CRM framework, would run the risk of having disproportionate regulation with limited benefits. \t\u00a0 \tSpecifically on the RTS on liquid assets mandate, the EBA recommends this be deleted from the CRR, while on the other two RTS, the EBA will be continuously monitoring the need to deliver on these mandates also in light of international developments in this regulatory area. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-published-an-assessment-of-the-current-credit-risk-mitigation-framework"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0573", "date": "2018-03-16", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA highlights progress in the work of supervisory colleges in 2017", "text": " The European Banking Authority published today its Report on the functioning of supervisory colleges in 2017, which summarises the EBA's assessment of the colleges' activities against the EBA 2017 Colleges Action Plan and the relevant regulation.

In this context, the EBA pointed out that not all available tools for reaching joint decisions have been used by the relevant authorities, in particular the option to resolve disagreements through mediation.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA identified four key topics for supervisory attention for 2017, namely 1) non-performing loans and balance sheet cleaning, 2) business model sustainability, 3) operational risk including conduct risk and IT risk, 4) Comparability of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and the use of EBA benchmarks in SREP.

Overall, the ESAs have found that while the development of Big Data poses some potential risks to financial services consumers, the benefits of this innovation currently outweigh these. Many of the risks identified by the ESAs are mitigated by existing legislation. \tThe report concludes that Big Data brings many benefits for the financial industry and consumers, such as more tailored products and services, improved fraud analytics, or enhanced efficiency of organisational internal procedures. On the other hand, financial services consumers should be made particularly aware of some of the risks posed by Big Data. The risks identified by the ESAs include the potential for errors in Big Data tools, which may lead to incorrect decisions being taken by financial service providers. Additionally, the increasing level of segmentation of customers, enabled by Big Data, may potentially influence the access and availability of certain financial services or products.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tWeighing both the benefits and the risks associated with this innovation, the ESAs have concluded that any legislative intervention at this point would be premature, considering that the existing legislation should mitigate many of the risks identified. The ESAs will continue to monitor any developments in this area in the coming years and invite financial firms to develop and implement good practices on the use of Big Data.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe objectives of the report was to\u00a0 \t\tmap the Big Data phenomenon and assess its potential benefits and risks; \t\t\u00a0 \t\traise awareness among consumers of their rights set in existing financial legislation and in other relevant areas; and \t\t\u00a0 \t\traise awareness of financial institutions of their obligations set in existing financial legislation and encourage the adaptation of good practices on Big Data. \tThe report results from a consultation conducted between December 2016 and March 2017.\u00a0 \tNotes for editors \t\tThe ESAs have created a factsheet on Big Data, aiming at informing consumers of financial services about the impact of Big Data. The factsheet provides consumers with the information about the potential benefits and risks of the use of Big Data techniques and aims to raise awareness of the measures consumers can take if they experience issues related to the use of Big Data. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tThe Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1 January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \t\t\u00a0 \t\tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering.

Based on the evidence submitted, the EBA does not object to the adoption of the proposed measure, which the HCSF intends to apply only to global or other systemically important institutions (G-SIIs and O-SIIs) with the aim of accounting for changes in the intensity of macroprudential/systemic risk that could pose a threat to financial stability in France. \t\u00a0 \tWith the application of the proposed measure, French systemically important institutions shall not incur an exposure exceeding 5 % of their eligible capital (versus the prescribed large exposures limit of 25%) for NFCs or groups of connected NFCs, which are assessed to be highly indebted.

The EBA notes that the backstop complements the existing prudential set of measures and the new accounting provisions under IFRS9 and the advice aims at providing some qualitative considerations as well as a conservative impact analysis of the proposed measures.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA conducted this analysis in response to the European Commission's request for advice to look into the expected impact the introduction of such statutory prudential backstops would have on banks, considering the different options proposed in its consultation, launched on 10 November 2017. In its impact analysis, the EBA provided some considerations about the design of the statutory prudential backstop as well as some quantitative evidence about the different specifications of the backstop. \tAs part of the process of repairing the EU banking sector, the EBA has pushed for speedy recognition, and resolution of asset quality issues in the EU. In this context, non-discretionary backstop requirements (i.e. compulsory deductions from regulatory capital) can help incentivise banks to address NPLs proactively and prevent their future accumulation on balance sheets.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe quantitative analysis has been conducted under a static balance sheet assumption, where no changes are envisaged in the outstanding stock of exposures and other balance sheet items, such as CET1 and Tier 2 capital. The latter remain all fixed at their last available reporting date level, i.e. 2017Q2. Moreover, institution and exposure class specific parameters, such as default rate, cure rates, recovery rates and impairment loss ratios are also fixed at their values in the period 2014 \u2013 2017, when asset quality issues at the EU level reached their peak. These conservative conditions are projected over a 20-year horizon. \t\u00a0 \tThe quantitative analysis is, therefore, based on a very conservative methodology, which extrapolates high NPL levels recently experienced within the EU onto a 20-year horizon and assumes no change in the banks origination standards nor in provisioning policies. The results show that, after 20 years, the statutory prudential backstop would lead to a decrease in the CET1 capital ratio of 205 basis points for the average European bank. Over a seven-year horizon, which is considered the maximum timeframe for banks and supervisors to adjust their policies, the cumulative impact would amount to 56 basis points, equal to 10% of retained earnings. \t\u00a0 \tThe analysis\u00a0 should be seen as an exercise in estimating what the impact of the prudential backstop on capital would have been, if it had been introduced in 2014 and banks had taken no action in response to the regulatory change. In fact, with a well-functioning prudential backstop, the impact of the measure should help prevent the future building up of NPLs.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe Report also includes a qualitative part, where the EBA considers the statutory prudential backstop from a supervisory perspective, focusing on the interaction of the backstop with the full set of available regulatory and supervisory measures, which are currently in place. In particular, it provides observations regarding the possible effects of prudential backstops in combination with existing CRR provisions, Pillar 2 measures as well as the newly introduced accounting provision under IFRS9. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThis Report is the EBA's response to the European Commission's call for advice on the introduction of statutory prudential backstops proposed in its consultation document published on 10 November 2017 and complements the Commission's legislative proposal published on 14 March 2018. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-advises-european-commission-on-the-use-of-prudential-backstops-to-prevent-the-building-up-of-new-npls"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0578", "date": "2018-03-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA launches call for expression of interest for new members of its stakeholders group", "text": " Announcement in all EU official languages \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 ce\u0161tina dansk Deutsch \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac espa\u00f1ol eesti keel suomi fran\u00e7ais hrvatski magyar italiano lietuvi\u0173 kalba latvie\u0161u valoda Malti Nederlands Polski Portugu\u00eas Rom\u00e2n\u0103 Sloven\u010dina Sloven\u0161\u010dina svenska The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a call for expression of interest for membership to its Banking Stakeholder Group (BSG), as the mandate for the majority of its members will expire on 14 October 2018.

This exercise presents aggregate data on EU banks' capital, leverage, and liquidity ratios assuming full implementation of the CRD IV-CRR/Basel III framework. Overall, the results, based on data as of 30 June 2017, show a further improvement of European banks' capital positions, with a total average Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 13.8% (13.4% as of 31 December 2016). This exercise does not reflect any BCBS standards agreed since the beginning of 2016 or any other measures currently being considered by the BCBS. \tOverall results assuming full implementation of CRD IV-CRR/Basel III (%) \tOn the capital side, the exercise estimated no shortfalls of CET1 capital, and relatively low shortfalls of Tier 1 and total capital, at EUR 0.1 billion and EUR 0.1 billion respectively.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe analysis of leverage ratio (LR) shows that there has been a continuous increase in the last periods. The analysis estimates the LR at 5.0% as of June 2017 (5.0% as of December 2016).

Compared with previous periods, there has been a continuous increase in banks' NSFR, mainly driven by the increasing amount of available stable funding (ASF) for both groups. Around 81% of participating banks already would meet the minimum NSFR requirement of 100%. \tNotes to the editors \t\tThe exercise monitors the impact of the transposition of the CRD IV-CRR/Basel III requirements on EU banks. In particular, it monitors the impact of fully implementing the European Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV - CRR) on banks' capital ratios (risk-based and non-risk-based) and on their LCR, as well as the impact of fully implementing the Basel III framework on banks' NSFR. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tThe results of the report are separately shown for small, medium-sized and large Group 2 banks, as well as Group 1 banks.

The second one is a more targeted component that would further increase risk weights in line with the risk profile of the bank's mortgage portfolio by applying an additional proportional 33% macroprudential risk weight add-on on top of the microprudential risk weight, which is to be applied to each (IRB) bank's (residential) mortgage portfolio.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn its Opinion, addressed to the Council, the European Commission and the NBB, the EBA acknowledges, in line with the ESRB warning on the vulnerabilities of the residential real estate sector, that the combined increase in house prices and debt levels could pose a threat to the financial stability of banks in Belgium in the event of a downturn.

For example, if a VC exchange goes out of business or consumers have their money stolen because their VC account is subject to a cyber-attack; there is no EU law that would cover their losses.Operational problemsSome VC exchanges have been subject to severe operational problems in the past. During these disruptions, consumers have been unable to buy and sell VCs when they wanted to and have suffered losses due to price fluctuations during the period of disruption.Background informationThis Warning is based on Article 9(3) of the three ESAs' founding Regulations and follows the publication of two statements by ESMA on Initial Coin Offerings in November 2017 and an earlier Warning to consumers and two Opinions on VCs published by EBA in December 2013, July 2014 and August 2016, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0VCs come in many forms.

The Report, which assesses authorities' compliance with the principles outlined in the EBA Guidelines, concludes that further analysis and greater experience of the risk-based systems in use is needed before proposing any changes to the current Guidelines. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA's analysis shows that the Guidelines have broadly met the aim of introducing different contribution levels for institutions according to their riskiness. However, the analysis also finds that the method outlined in the Guidelines, and currently in use, allows too much flexibility, and it may need to be reviewed in the future to ensure a more consistent approach, while still catering for national specificities. \t\u00a0 \tThe Report also highlights that the approach taken by Member States in line with the Guidelines seems to ensure a good level of transparency to stakeholders and not to cause excessive additional reporting requirements.

Using quantitative risk indicators, along with the opinions of banks and market analysts from its Risk Assessment Questionnaire, the EBA's dashboard identified ongoing improvements in the repair of the EU banking sector but also residual risks in NPLs and profitability.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn the third quarter of 2017, EU banks' continued to strengthen their capital ratios. The CET1 ratio experienced an increase of 30 bps, from 14.3% in Q2 2017 to 14.6% in Q3 2017. This growth was jointly driven by an increase in CET1 capital and decrease in the total risk exposures amount, mostly for credit risk. Compared to the previous quarter, the fully loaded CET1 ratio also increased by 30 bps to 14.3%. \t\u00a0 The ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) kept a modest downward trend, decreasing by 30 bps to 4.2%, and suggesting that, although slowly, supervisory efforts are bearing their fruit. However, the results of the EBA Risk Assessment Questionnaire suggest that major impediments to the resolution of NPLs remain, such as lengthy and expensive judiciary processes and the lack of liquidity in secondary NPL markets. In this respect, the recently published EBA NPL transaction templates are a first contribution to widen the investors' base and reduce asymmetric information in the secondary market. \t\u00a0 Profitability indicators have improved slightly but sustainable returns remain elusive for many banks. On a year-on-year comparison, the average ROE rose by 1.7 percentage points (pp) to 7.1% in Q3 2017, mainly driven by the annual increase in net trading income (8.9% in Q3 2017). Nevertheless, the widespread dispersion among countries (with the ROE ranging from -20.0% to 18.1%), along with high operating costs, continues to dampen profitability prospects for the European banking sector as a whole. Also the results of the EBA Risk Assessment Questionnaire show that banks' profitability remains a concern, even though banks, as well as market analysts, expect a slight improvement in the near future. \t\u00a0 The loan-to-deposit ratio continued to decrease, reaching 117.2% with a 30 bps decline from the previous quarter. The leverage ratio remained broadly stable, increasing 10 bps from 5.3% (Q2 2017) to 5.4% (Q3 2017). In September 2017, the average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 144.6%, well above the threshold defined as the liquidity coverage requirement for 2017 (80%). Regarding the future of EU banks' funding, the results of the EBA Risk Assessment Questionnaire suggest that banks are expected to attain more instruments eligible for MREL, even though they consider the uncertainty on the specific MREL requirements as a constraint to their issuance. \t\u00a0 \tThe results of the Risk Assessment Questionnaire also show that cyber risk and data security are considered as the main drivers for the increase in operational risk. They are also assumed to be the main factors that might negatively influence market sentiment, along with the uncertainties around the UK's decision to leave the EU. \tNotes to editors \tThe figures included in the Risk Dashboard are based on a sample of 152 banks, covering more than 80% of the EU banking sector (by total assets), at the highest level of consolidation, while country aggregates may also include large subsidiaries (the list of banks can be found here) ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/the-eba-risk-dashboard-confirms-steady-improvements-in-the-eu-banking-sector-but-banks-profitability-and-business-model-sustainability-remain-key-chal"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0593", "date": "2018-01-12", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes final Guidelines on disclosure requirements of IFRS 9 transitional arrangements", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final Guidelines on disclosure requirements of IFRS 9 or analogous expected credit losses (ECLs) transitional arrangements.

Based on an analysis of data submitted by the institutions still using the 180 DPD criterion, the EBA recommends that this exemption be disallowed and all institutions should consequently rely on the 90 DPD regime for all exposures. \tBased on a stock take, the EBA found that only a limited number of institutions in the EU currently make use of the 180 DPD criterion. The EBA analysed the impact of removing the 180 DPD criterion for these institutions on risk weighted exposure amounts and capital ratios. The results indicate an average relative change in risk exposure amounts of around +1.61 percent and an average expected decrease in the capital ratio of 0.37 percentage points, although with variation across the analysed institutions.\u00a0 \tIn light of the widespread use of the 90 DPD criterion in the EU, the limited use of the 180 DPD criterion, the variability in risk weights caused by the 180 DPD criterion and the forthcoming changes in the accounting framework, the EBA recommends to the European Commission to disallow the application of the 180 DPD criterion.

These assumptions are in line with the EBA RTS on MREL but are, by definition, different from the actual levels of MREL that will ultimately be determined for each institution and group. \t\tThe two scenarios considered in the Report for the calibration of MREL are: the loss-absorbing buffer, or \u2018LA buffer' scenario, amounting to twice capital requirements where combined buffer requirements are only included once for loss absorption purposes; and the \u2018Buffer/8%' scenario, a more stringent calibration where banks must meet the higher of twice capital requirements and buffers, or 8% of total liabilities and own funds.\" \t\tCentral estimates on which the figures above are based assume a full recapitalisation for G-SIBs and O-SIIs, a subordination requirement for G-SIBs in line with the TLAC standard, and a subordination requirement for O-SIIs of 13.5% of RWAs in line with the subordination recommendations made in the Report. Estimates for other banks, that are neither G-SIBS nor O-SIIs, assume partial (50%) recapitalisation only and do not include a systematic subordination requirement. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-updates-its-quantitative-analysis-on-mrel"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0597", "date": "2017-12-20", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes full impact assessment of Basel reforms on EU banks", "text": " Following up on the cumulative assessment published on 7 December 2017, the European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its full assessment quantifying the impact of the reform package recently agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) on the European banking system.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThis exercise presents aggregate data on EU banks assuming full implementation of the final Basel III framework, as endorsed by the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHoS), and reflects all the revisions to the credit and operational risk approaches, as well as to the process for the estimation of the leverage ratio (LR).

Differences have been identified both in the assessment of institutions' eligibility for simplified obligations, as well as in determining the reduced scope of the recovery and resolution planning requirements laid down in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). The RTS should help reduce some of the observed divergent practices by increasing harmonisation in simplified obligations eligibility assessment methodologies applied by national authorities.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the Report shows that as of 30 April 2017, only around half of the competent and resolution authorities across the EU had granted simplified obligations or waivers to institutions in their respective jurisdictions. The remaining authorities did not apply simplified obligations or waivers because they had chosen not to exercise this discretion or because of delays in the transposition of the BRRD into their national legal frameworks. \t\u00a0 \tWith regard to eligibility assessments for simplified obligations, the EBA analysis highlights the use by competent and resolution authorities of different practices across the EU.

At the reporting date of 31 December 2016, EU banks' average LCR was significantly above the 100% minimum requirement, which will have to be fully implemented by 1 January 2018. In addition, a more in-depth analysis suggests that the LCR regulation, together with capital standards and stable funding, have helped banks increase their lending to real economy. The Report is based on liquidity data and wider bank balance sheet statistics from 157 EU banks across 16 Member States.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tKey findings \tThe Report shows that as of end-December 2016, EU banks' average LCR was 139% and the aggregate gross shortfall amounted to EUR 115 million. The increase in the LCR can be mainly attributed to an increase in liquid assets, which, since June 2011, have almost doubled. In contrast, net cash outflows have remained relatively stable. Central bank exposures and central government assets in banks' liquidity buffers continue to be an important component for their compliance with the LCR regulation. \t\u00a0 \tThis suggests that in the future, banks' short-term liquidity profiles may be affected by the changes in the macroeconomic dynamics. In addition, the Report shows that, on average, banks in various business models reach the 100% minimum requirement, despite large dispersions amongst them. \t\u00a0 \tA further analysis on the banks' wider balance sheet shows that the LCR requirements support lending to real economy and a shortfall in liquidity requirements has a negative impact on banks' lending. Overall, liquidity requirements together with capital standards and stable funding increase the resilience of banks' balance sheets and reduce liquidity risk in the banking system. Funding markets reward highly liquid banks and the cost of funding decreases, thus creating further lending opportunities for these banks. \tLegal basis and background\u00a0 \tThis Report has been drafted in accordance with Article 509(1) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), which mandates the EBA to monitor and evaluate the liquidity measures and their impact on the EU banking sector on an annual basis. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-report-shows-that-eu-banks-comply-with-lcr-requirement-of-100-ahead-of-its-full-implementation"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0603", "date": "2017-12-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA publishes Discussion Paper on EU implementation of the revised market and counterparty credit risk frameworks", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a Discussion Paper on the implementation in the European Union (EU) of the revised market risk and counterparty credit risk frameworks, i.e. the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) and the Standardised Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR).

The report is accompanied by the 2017 EU-wide transparency exercise, which provides key data in a comparable and accessible format for 132 banks across the EU. The data shows further resilience in the EU banking sector amid a benign macroeconomic and financial environment, with an additional strengthening of the capital position, an improvement of asset quality and a slight increase of profitability. However, further progress on NPLs is needed whilst the long-term sustainability of prevailing business models remains a challenge. The importance of robust data management and IT and operational resilience is also a priority. \tEU banking sector solvency has continued to strengthen, albeit at a slower pace. The CET1 ratio1 stood at 14.3% as of June 2017, up by 70 bps with respect to June 2016 level. The trend is similar for the fully-loaded CET1 ratio, which reached 14%. The slight increase of capital ratios has been mainly driven by a reduction of the denominator, with banks decreasing their risk exposure amount, markedly for credit risk. \tThe NPL ratio of EU banks has decreased from 5.4% (as of June 2016) to 4.5%, due to the decline of NPLs, reflecting progress made by EU banks to clean-up their balance sheet. However, around one-third of EU jurisdictions have NPL ratios above 10% and the level of NPLs still remains at a very high historical level (EUR 893Bn). EU area coverage ratio increased to 45% with a high dispersion among countries. EU banks total assets decreased by 6.3% between June 2016 and June 2017. The decline has been driven by the reduction of derivatives exposures and debt securities, while banks have continued to increase loans volume. Profitability has cautiously improved supported by the benign environment but still remains a key challenge for the EU banking sector. As of June 2017, the average return on equity (RoE) stood at 7.0%, up by 130 bps year on year, its highest level since 2014. This upward trend is mainly explained by a decrease in impairments, an increase of fees and commissions and an increase of trading profits. However, dispersion across countries is still high. The average RoE has remained below the cost of equity and many banks are still struggling to generate sufficient margins through their traditional lending activity in a context of low rate environment and flat yield curves. \tBank funding markets have been characterised by stable conditions in the first three quarters of 2017 amid low volatility. While accommodative monetary policy stances and central banks' asset purchase programmes have supported low funding costs, overall issuance volumes of unsecured and secured debt decreased in the first three quarters of 2017 compared to 2016. \tIn the fast-changing environment, new and high risks have emerged, which cyber and data security among the most challenging ones for the EU banking sector. In addition, risks posed by cyberattacks, their volume and sophistication are unabatedly high. While banking operations have become increasingly dependent on IT platforms, cost pressures and operational challenges have contributed to an increasing reliance on third party service providers that a range of IT services and data are outsourced to. \tNotes to the editors \t\tThe EBA has been conducting transparency exercises at EU-wide level on an annual basis since 2011. The transparency exercise is part of the EBA's ongoing efforts to foster transparency and market discipline in the EU financial market, and complements banks' own Pillar 3 disclosures, as laid down in the EU's capital requirements directive (CRD). Unlike stress tests, transparency exercises are purely disclosure exercises where only bank-by-bank data are published and no shocks are applied to the actual data. \t\t\u00a0 \t\t\u00a0The 2017 transparency exercise covers 132 banks from 25 EEA countries, and data is disclosed at the highest level of consolidation as of December 2016 and June 2017.

The Report reviews consistency in the application of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) in order to promote comparable supervisory approaches and consistency in supervisory outcomes across the single market. This is necessary for a level playing field, effective supervision of cross border groups, and to identify supervisory best practices.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn the Report, the EBA notes that good progress has been made by competent authorities in the implementation of the SREP Guidelines as well as in taking forward recommendations and observations made by the EBA during the 2016 bilateral convergence visits. A significant degree of convergence across the single market has already been achieved through the application of the EBA's SREP guidelines. The Report highlights, however, a number of remaining challenges in converging capital adequacy assessments and determining institution-specific additional own funds requirements (P2R).\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the Report observes different approaches in the use of the outcomes for banks' own internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP), disparity of risk taxonomies, and differences in the clarity of the risk-by-risk determination of P2R, as well as the use of P2R for macroprudential purposes. In turn, this leads to differences in the articulation and communication of P2R to supervised institutions. Finally, the Report notes the widespread use of Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), but limited experience in this area makes the analysis of the first wave of application of P2G difficult. \t\u00a0 \tFurther progress on convergence will be supported by ongoing policy work such as adjustments to the SREP framework as well as upcoming revisions to the Pillar 2 framework in the CRR/CRD. The EBA will also continue to promote supervisory convergence through active monitoring and assessment of supervisory practices, which help competent authorities in the effective implementation of agreed policy products, as well as to further expand its supervisory training offering.\u00a0 \tNotes to editors \tOne of the EBA's key mandates is to develop ensure supervisory convergence and consistency of supervisory outcomes within the EU. In addition, Article 107 of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD) includes a specific mandate for the EBA on consistency of supervisory reviews, evaluations and supervisory measures in Member States. This Article also requires the EBA to report to the EU Parliament and the Council on the degree of convergence of supervisory practices. \t\u00a0 \tBased on this mandate, the EBA has collected information and analysed relevant supervisory practices.

The clarifications focus on the main concepts and definitions underlying the calibration of risk parameters, as these are the basis for the calculation of capital requirements and, therefore, have to be identified in an objective manner. The Guidelines allow for sufficient flexibility in model development to ensure appropriate risk differentiation and to preserve the risk sensitivity of models. \t\u00a0 \tThe specific clarifications included in the Guidelines cover, among other items, the discounting factor used to calculate realised LGD on historical observations. To ensure comparability of LGD estimates, the EBA decided to introduce a simplified concept of discounting factor where the discounting rate is specified as Euribor or an equivalent interbank rate for currencies other than euro plus a fixed add-on of 5%, which will have to be applied by institutions. While the proposed level of the add-on provides an adequate balance between the currently used discounting rates across the EU, the adequacy of the level of the add-on will be further analysed and, if necessary, reviewed before the application of these Guidelines. The EBA is also planning to publish a list of equivalent interest rates for exposures in currencies other than euro to be used in the LGD estimation. \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines are complemented by a Report on the results of the EBA qualitative survey carried out across the EU banks using the IRB Approach. The Report includes an overview of the current practices in IRB modelling and provides as a detailed impact assessment of the Guidelines. Changes are expected to apply to the majority of existing models in order to ensure compliance with these Guidelines. However, the materiality of these changes will have to be assessed and treated in accordance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 on the materiality of extensions and changes to rating systems. \tLegal basis, implementation and next steps \tThe EBA has developed these Guidelines on its own initiative in accordance with Article 16 of its founding Regulation, which mandates the Authority to issue guidelines and recommendations addressed to competent authorities or financial institutions with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the ESFS, and to ensuring the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law. \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines will apply at the latest from 1 January 2021, but earlier implementation is encouraged. Institutions should engage with their competent authorities at an early stage in order to determine an adequate implementation plan, including the timeline for the supervisory assessment and approval of material model changes, where necessary. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA is currently finalising its draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn. Once these RTS are finalised, the Guidelines will be updated with additional clarifications on how to use the specified concept of the economic downturn in the estimation of downturn LGD. \t\u00a0 \tFinally, these Guidelines include numerous references to the final draft RTS on the IRB assessment methodology and, therefore, these two documents should be read together.

To this end, the Guidelines present a non-exhaustive list of situations that should be considered by institutions when assessing economic dependencies. The Guidelines also make clear that if institutions are able to demonstrate that the financial difficulties or failure of a client would not lead to funding or repayment difficulties for another client, these clients do not need to be considered a single risk (e.g. where the client can easily find a replacement for the other client).\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tGuidance is also provided on the assessment of situations where control and economic dependency are interlinked and can, therefore, lead to the existence of one group of connected clients as opposed to two separate groups of connected clients.\u00a0 \tRegardless of the type of connection the single risk is based on, the chain of contagion leading to a possible default of all entities concerned is the relevant factor for the grouping.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines expect institutions to identify all control relationships and also to take reasonable steps to investigate and identify economic dependencies among their clients.

The reports cover credit risk for large corporate, institutions, and sovereign portfolios (collectively referred to as \"low default portfolios\" - LDP), as well as market risk. The results confirm previous findings, with the majority of risk-weights (RWs) variability explained by fundamentals. These benchmarking exercises, conducted by the EBA on an annual basis are a fundamental supervisory and convergence tool to address unwarranted inconsistencies and restoring trust in internal models. \tLDP Credit Risk exercise \tThe LDP credit risk report examines the different drivers leading to the observed dispersion across banks' models. Most of the results are broadly in line with previous LDP exercises, with 61% of the difference in variability explained by a few drivers (the proportion of defaulted exposures in the portfolio; the country of the counterparty; and the portfolio mix). The remaining variability could be attributed to differences in riskiness \u2013 i.e., idiosyncratic portfolio features, modelling assumptions and risk management practices used by banks, as well as supervisory practices. An analysis was performed to quantify the impact on RWs for banks with lower RWs. If banks' parameters were replaced by benchmarking parameters, RW would increase by 7.9 percentage points (7.5 percentage points in the 2015 LDP exercise). \t\u00a0 \tIn line with the EBA IRB roadmap, this exercise confirmed that the definition of default and the treatment of defaulted assets are key areas of supervisory attention. The EBA is currently finalising its Guidelines on the estimation of risk parameters, which are expected to be published by the end of November 2017. \tMarket Risk exercise \tFor market risk, the initial market valuation variability tends to be lower for interest rate portfolios due to more consistent practices across banks for modelling interest rate risk. In line with the previous exercises, a significant dispersion for all the risk measures is observed, particularly for more sophisticated measures, such as the Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) and All Price Risk (APR). \t\u00a0 \tModelling choices play an important role in explaining this variability, especially for the most complex risk measures. This calls for further investigations by supervisors in areas such as the materiality of risk factors not in VaR and the consistent representation of the migration effects for IRC on a low credit spread rates environment. \tNote to the editors\u00a0 \tThese annual benchmarking exercises contribute to the work the EBA is conducting for improving the regulatory framework, increase convergence of supervisory practices and, thus, restoring confidence in internal models.

This has been highlighted also in the EBA's Consultation Paper on draft RTS on methods of consolidation, published today, and previously in the Authority's reply to the European Commission's request for an overview of possible errors and inconsistencies in the CRDIV and CRR observed via the Single Rulebook Q&A tool.\u00a0 The EBA urges the EU institutions to give consideration to further possible amendments to the definitions of these terms in order to ensure the consistent treatment of prudential risks and to promote the level playing field.\u00a0The EBA observes that Annex I to the CRDIV, which enlists the activities subject to mutual recognition (i.e. activities that credit institutions and financial institutions are permitted to carry out throughout the EU by establishing branches or the cross-border provision of services), has been largely unchanged for 30 years and urges the EU institutions to give consideration to clarifications and updates to the Annex.\u200eFinally, the EBA observes significant variation in the prudential treatment of OFIs (e.g. consumer and corporate lenders and securitisation vehicles) under national law.

In addition, these Guidelines do not limit in any form the freedom of institutions to establish branches in other Member States, nor they create additional obligations to institutions in terms of Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) or reporting. \t\u00a0 Legal basis \tThe EBA has developed these Guidelines on its own initiative in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. The Guidelines elaborate on the existing legal frameworks established by the CRD, the BRRD and the EBA technical standards. \tThese Guidelines specify, how the consolidating \u00a0supervisor, the home and the host competent authorities should, within the framework of colleges of supervisors established either under Article 116 or under Article 51 (3) of the CRD , cooperate to prudentially supervise and coordinate the exercise of their powers referred to in Title V, Chapter 4 and Title VI, Chapters 1 and 3 of that Directive and in Title II, Section 2 of Directive 2014/59/EU in relation to branches of Union institutions established in another Member State. \tThese Guidelines apply only in relation to those significant branches referred to in Article 51 of the CRD whose intensification test performed in accordance with Section 4.2 of the draft Guidelines results in them being deemed \u2018significant-plus' branches for the purpose of these Guidelines.

The revisions focus on stress testing, particularly its use in setting Pillar 2 capital guidance (P2G), as well as interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB). The consultations on all three guidelines run until 31 January 2018. \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the publication includes: \t\tan update of the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodology for Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP Guidelines); \t\tan update of the EBA guidelines on the management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading activities (IRRBB Guidelines); and \t\tan update of the EBA guidelines on institutions' stress testing. \tThe comprehensive EU SREP framework, which was introduced by the EBA in 2014, is now well established and in use by supervisors across the EU. Following the global regulatory developments, as well as the EBA's supervisory convergence assessments, specific changes are needed to reinforce the framework as set out in the EBA's Pillar 2 Roadmap.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe overall SREP framework and the Guidelines remain intact and the consultation is only focused on the elements being updated. In particular, the revisions enhance the requirements for supervisory stress testing and explain how stress testing outcomes will be used in setting P2G. The guidelines have also been updated with assessments of internal governance based on the recently revised EBA Guidelines on internal governance. \t\u00a0 \tThe revised IRRBB Guidelines reflect developments in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and clarify internal governance and supervisory outlier tests requirements during the first phase of the European implementation of the Basel standards. The revisions are, therefore, intended to act as a bridge to the future requirements, which will be incorporated in the CRD V/ CRR2 framework. \t\u00a0 \tThe revised guidelines on institutions' stress testing update the EBA's 2010 guidelines to reflect industry practices and the incorporation of recovery planning.

The Opinion aims at providing greater certainty to firms and ultimately at ensuring a level playing field. In the Opinion, the EBA addresses a number of relevant policy topics relating to authorisations, the prudential regulation and supervision of investment firms, internal models, outsourcing, internal governance, risk transfers via back-to-back and intragroup operations, and resolution and deposit guarantee scheme issues. The EBA will monitor how the Opinion will be applied in practice by authorities and will continue its policy and risk analysis work in relation to the challenges posed by Brexit. \t\u00a0 \tThe Opinion is focused on the period prior to the departure of the UK. The overarching principles underlying all of the guidance in the opinion are that: (i) the existing legal and regulatory framework should be applied in a consistent and harmonious way throughout the EU, and competition on regulatory or supervisory standards should be avoided; (ii) authorities should avoid imposing an unnecessary regulatory burden on firms, while at the same time regulatory standards which have always applied should be maintained; and (iii) cooperation and coordination between supervisors, as well as between supervisors and resolution authorities, is important both now and in the future.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn each of the specific areas identified by the EBA, the Opinion sets out some key principles, followed by specific detailed technical guidance addressed to firms and authorities. A report is appended to the Opinion setting out the detailed analysis underlying the guidance provided. \t\u00a0 \tExamples of the areas where guidance is provided include authorisations, the prudential regulation and supervision of investment firms, and resolution. On the first topic, the EBA is of the view that existing authorisation standards should not be lowered and that the same procedures and standards that have always applied should continue to do so. In addition, the EBA believes that firms seeking authorisation should undergo a rigorous assessment against the relevant requirements. Firms should provide a clear explanation of the choices they are making in terms of the substance of the incoming entity, and \"empty shell\" companies should not be authorised. Finally, the regulatory burden on firms should be kept to a minimum through the use of existing information held by competent authorities, and through cooperation between authorities.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tOn the second topic, the EBA is of the opinion that the provision of investment services in the EU should be subject to adequate prudential supervision and oversight. For institutions established in the Union, this should entail an updated prudential framework in line with the EBA's report on investment firms while systemic investment firms established in the Banking Union should be subject to the supervision of the ECB. Investment services provided by third country investment firms should also be subject to adequate prudential rules and oversight. \t\u00a0 \tOn resolution, the EBA notes the potential for Brexit to impact on ongoing resolution reforms, not least in the area of building loss absorbing capacity. At present, significant issuance of liabilities eligible for the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) takes place in the UK under English law. It is important that institutions and authorities consider the implications of the departure of the UK for the build-up of MREL, and take steps now to mitigate relevant risks. \tLegal basis \tThe EBA's competence to deliver an opinion is based on Articles 29(1)(a) and 34(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010\u00a0 (\"EBA Regulation\"). Article 29(1)(a) mandates the EBA to play an active role in building a common Union supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices and approaches throughout the Union including by providing opinions to competent authorities, while Article 34(1) empowers the EBA to provide opinions to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on all issues related to its area of competence, including on issues within the EBA's competence arising in the context of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. \t\u00a0 \tNotes to editors \t\tOn 29 March 2017, the UK notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the EU pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. The withdrawal will take place on the date of entry into force of a withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification, on 30 March 2019. \t\tThe EBA has decided to issue this opinion in response to this unprecedented situation, to provide guidance on supervisory expectations and to address regulatory and supervisory arbitrage risks that arise as a result of increased requests from entities seeking to relocate to the EU27 within a relatively short period of time. This opinion is complementary to those issued by ESMA and EIOPA. \t\tThe opinion is a non-binding statement of the EBA's expectations about how authorities and institutions should behave. The EBA will monitor how the opinion is applied in practice and continue to seek convergence through its tools and powers.

The progress is positive, but risks remain heightened on asset quality and sustainable profitability. \t\u00a0 \tIn the second quarter of 2017, the CET1 ratio reached a new peak since Q4 2014, increasing from 14.1% in Q1 2017 to 14.3% in Q2 2017, with all EU countries experiencing an average ratio above 10%. However, this outcome was driven by a reduction of the denominator, with banks decreasing their risk exposure amounts (by EUR 195bn), particularly for credit risk, also in connection with the liquidation or restructuring of some intermediaries. \t\u00a0 \tThe quality of banks' loans portfolios continued improving, although the slow progress and wider dispersion among countries remained a concern.

These Guidelines aim at further harmonising institutions' internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms across the EU, in line with the new requirements in this area introduced in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) and also taking into account the proportionality principle. Effective internal governance is fundamental if individual institutions and the banking system as a whole are to operate well. \t\u00a0 \tWeaknesses in corporate governance in a number of institutions have contributed to excessive and imprudent risk-taking in the banking sector, which has led to the failure of individual institutions and systemic problems in Member States and globally. In order to address the potentially detrimental effects of poorly designed corporate governance arrangements on the sound management of risk, and to take into account the new requirements introduced in the CRD in this area, the EBA has updated its Guidelines on internal governance, originally published on 27 September 2011. \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines put more emphasis on the duties and responsibilities of the management body in its supervisory function in risk oversight, including the role of their committees. They aim at improving the status of the risk management function, enhancing the information flow between the risk management function and the management body and ensuring effective monitoring of risk governance by supervisors. The \u2018know-your \u2013structure' and complex structures sections, especially following the \u2018Panama events', have been strengthened to ensure that the management body is aware of the risks that can be triggered by complex and opaque structures and to improve transparency.

Paragraph (3) of that Article mandates the EBA to issue Guidelines on those arrangements, processes and mechanisms. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA Guidelines will apply as of 30 June 2018 to competent authorities across the EU, as well as to institutions on an individual and consolidated basis.

To prevent such abuse, \u00a0payment service providers must be able to establish who sends and receives these funds.

This work builds on the EBA's monitoring activity of supervisory practices in the area of significant risk transfer, which the Authority started in 2014 with the publication of the EBA Guidelines on this topic. The discussion paper aims at seeking stakeholders' views on how to further harmonise the regulation and supervision of the risk transfer through securitisation. The EBA's proposals are based on the newly agreed European securitisation legislation. The consultation runs until 19 December 2017. \u00a0 In response to the mandate on significant risk transfer laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), this paper puts forward for public discussion proposals to strengthen the regulation and supervision framework of significant risk transfer and to improve regulatory certainty and level playing field for institutions transferring risk through securitisation.\u00a0 \u00a0 Based on its monitoring activity, the EBA found that further regulatory specifications may be needed with regards to the process of significant risk transfer assessment, its quantitative assessment by competent authorities as well as the supervisory approach to core structural features of the securitisation transaction, such as, for example, amortisation structure, excess spread, cost of credit protection, and call options. The EBA's analysis also covers the significant risk transfer in securitisation of non-performing loans (NPLs), one of the key measures towards the NPL resolution. \u00a0 Consulting stakeholders at this stage is particularly important as the EBA's proposals are fully based on the newly agreed European securitisation framework, which will enter into force in the coming months, and will introduce simple transparent and standardised securitisations across the EU.

This exercise presents aggregate data on EU banks' capital, leverage, and liquidity ratios assuming full implementation of the CRD IV-CRR/Basel III framework. Overall, the results, based on data as of 31 December 2016, show a further improvement of European banks' capital positions, with a total average Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 13.4% (12.8% as of 30 June 2016). This exercise does not reflect any BCBS standards agreed since the beginning of 2016 or any other measures currently being considered by the BCBS. \t\u00a0 \tOverall results assuming full implementation of CRD IV-CRR/Basel III (%) \t\u00a0 \t\tOn the capital side, the exercise estimated relatively low shortfalls of CET1 capital, at EUR 1.7 billion, and of Tier 1 and total capital, at EUR 3.6 billion and EUR 5.1 billion respectively.\u00a0 \t\t\u00a0 \t\tThe analysis of leverage ratio (LR) shows that there has been a continuous increase in the last periods. The analysis estimates the LR at 5.0% as of December 2016 (4.7% as of June 2016). A small percentage of institutions in the sample (2.3%) would be constrained by the minimum leverage ratio requirement (3%) on top of risk-based minimum requirements.\u00a0 \t\t\u00a0 \t\tOn the liquidity side, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) analysis is based on data in accordance with the Commission's Delegated Regulation. The average LCR was 139.5% at end December 2016 (133.7% as of June 2016), while 99.2% of the banks in the sample show a LCR above the full implementation minimum requirement applicable from January 2018 (100%). The shortfall to meet the full-implementation minimum LCR requirement would be EUR 0.1 billion. In addition, time-series analyses show that the weighted average LCR has increased since June 2011, mainly due an increase in banks' liquidity buffers. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tIn the absence of a finalised EU definition, the EBA monitors the NSFR compliance with the current Basel III standards.

Compared with previous periods, there has been a continuous increase in banks' NSFR, mainly driven by the increasing amount of available stable funding (ASF) for both groups. Around 87.5% of participating banks already would meet the minimum NSFR requirement of 100%. \t\tNotes to the editors \t\t\u00a0 \t\t\t\tThe exercise monitors the impact of the transposition of the CRD IV-CRR/Basel III requirements on EU banks. In particular, it monitors the impact of fully implementing the European Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV - CRR) on banks' capital ratios (risk-based and non-risk-based) and on their LCR, as well as the impact of fully implementing the Basel III framework on banks' NSFR. \t\t\t\tThe results of the report are separately shown for small, medium-sized and large Group 2 banks, as well as Group 1 banks.

The reports aim to provide important information for EU supervisors to assess the sustainability of banks' main sources of funding. The results of the assessment show that banks plan to increase their lending and to expand deposits as well as market based funding.Forecasted loan growth to be funded by client deposits and issuance of long term debtThe EBA asked 155 banks for their plans for funding over 3 years to 2019. These plans show that, on average, total assets are projected to grow by 3.9% between 2016 and 2019. The main drivers for asset growth are loans to households and to non-financial corporates. Further analysis suggests that high NPL levels combined with more thinly capitalised banks could be a drag on new lending unless addressed.Client deposits remain the main component in EU banks' funding mix with a share of more than 50%. Banks forecast an expansion of deposits, which will require careful monitoring, at both an individual and system level. Planned issuances of debt securities in 2017 also looks set to increase in 2018 and 2019. In addition, the plans suggest that the share of covered bonds as a source of asset encumbrance will continue its rising trend. The outlook for funding plans should be seen in the context of the need to issue further minimum requirements for eligible liabilities (MREL) and the wind down of central banks' funding support measures. Amid such trends, banks' forecasted reliance on interest income to improve profitability will require careful monitoring.Asset encumbrance increased slightly in 2016The asset encumbrance report, which is backward looking, shows that in December 2016, the overall weighted average encumbrance ratio stood at 26.6% against 25.4% in December 2015. However, the report highlights a wide dispersion across institutions and countries, which is consistent with what was observed in the previous report.Besides covered bonds, the main sources of asset encumbrance are repos and over-the-counter derivatives. Some of the countries particularly affected by the sovereign debt crisis showed a decreased dependence towards the use of central bank funding, which could reflect a general improvement of the funding situation in these countries.Notes to editorsThe reports issued today were carried out on the basis of data submissions on funding plans and asset encumbrance. Whereas the funding plan data has a forward looking perspective, the report on asset encumbrance is based on data for the period from December 2014 to December 2016.

The Implementing Regulations are part of the EU Single Rulebook for banking and insurance aimed at creating a safe and sound regulatory framework consistently applicable across the European Union (EU). The consultation runs until 18/09/2017. \t\u00a0 \tThe Implementing Regulations developed by the ESAs and adopted by the European Commission on 7 and 11 October 2016, aim at ensuring that only credit ratings issued by External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) \u2013 those credit rating agencies (CRAs) registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 or central banks issuing credit ratings exempt from the application of the same regulation - can be used for calculating capital requirements of financial institutions and insurance undertakings.

Also, the Report confirms that banks have reduced their plans for parallel runs of IFRS 9 and IAS 39. Banks will use various data, processes and models to estimate expected credit losses. This may affect comparability among banks and, therefore, disclosures will be key. \tOn the quantitative side, the responses received show that the estimated impact of IFRS 9 is mainly driven by IFRS 9 impairment requirements. The estimated increase of provisions is on average 13% compared to the current levels of provisions under IAS 39. The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios are expected to decrease on average by up to 45 basis points (bps). Smaller banks, which mainly use the Standardised Approach (SA) for measuring credit risk, estimated a larger impact on own funds ratios than larger banks of the sample. \tNext steps \tThe EBA will continue the dialogue with banks and auditors on the implementation issues observed in this exercise and encourages banks to continue their efforts towards the high-quality implementation of IFRS 9. The EBA acknowledges that banks will continue improving elements of the implementation of IFRS 9 after its initial application. \tIn the medium and long term, the EBA is interested in achieving a better understanding on how the differences in the implementation of IFRS 9 may affect the measurement of expected credit losses. In addition, the EBA will continue to be involved in discussions at the EU and international levels (i.e. with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision) to explore further if any changes to the current regulatory framework may be necessary to ensure a proper interaction of the capital framework with the expected credit loss model in accounting. \tIn parallel, the EBA also launched today a public consultation on its guidelines on uniform disclosure of IFRS 9 transitional arrangements to ensure institutions' Pillar 3 disclosures on capital and leverage ratios are consistent across the EU during the transitional period.

Where banks decide to phase-in the impact of the implementation of IFRS 9 and analogous ECLs, they will have to include in their Pillar 3 disclosures their capital and leverage ratios with and without the application of the transitional arrangements, so that users are able to determine the impact of the arrangements on those ratios.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tTo ensure institutions' Pillar 3 disclosures regarding capital and leverage ratios are consistent across the EU during the transitional period, it is crucial that a uniform format on the disclosure of these parameters is used.

The data provides an overview of the level of pre-funded resources available to each Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) in the EU to cover its potential liabilities to depositors. The pre-funded available financial means of each DGS are in the process of being built up under a new funding model introduced in 2014. However, the deposit guarantee of \u20ac100,000 (or equivalent in local currency) remains fully in effect, and built up available financial means are only one source of funding for EU DGSs. With this publication, which will be done on a yearly basis, the EBA will contribute to enhance transparency and public accountability of DGSs across the EU to the benefit of depositors, markets, policymakers, DGSs and Members States. \tEvery year, the EBA receives data from each EU Member State on available financial means and covered deposits. The first set of data, with reference date as of 31 December 2015, was received in 2016. The second set of data with reference as of 31 December 2016 was received in 2017. This data provides a point-in-time snapshot of the extent to which DGSs across the EU are building up funds to help cover the guarantee they offer to depositors. However, the data should be interpreted carefully given the national specificities that still exist in individual Member States. As a matter of fact, data for different Member States is not immediately comparable without taking these national specificities into account. A detailed description of these specificities and the data along with relevant explanations can be found here. \tLegal basis and background \tDeposit guarantees are an important measure for maintaining confidence in banking systems, and for managing financial distress in individual banks. The degree of harmonisation of deposit guarantees in the EU has been enhanced by the 2014 Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive. In each Member State the repayment of covered deposits is unequivocally guaranteed, with a minimum coverage level of \u20ac100,000 (or equivalent in local currency) per depositor per institution. In order to increase the robustness of the funding for this guarantee, the 2014 Directive requires Member States to build up funds over a number of years, by raising levies from their banks. \tArticle 10(10) of that Directive requires Member States to inform EBA of the amount of covered deposits in their Member State and of the amount of the available financial means of their DGSs on 31 December of the preceding year. \tThe deposit guarantee is one tool for managing crisis in the financial system. A new set of \"bank resolution\" tools has also been introduced since the crisis. These tools allow the authorities to restructure a failing bank without putting it into liquidation and triggering the deposit guarantee payout. In combination, the more robustly-funded deposit guarantee schemes and the existence of bank resolution tools will allow the authorities to manage firm failures in the financial system, without causing systemic issues and without recourse to State-funded bailouts.

Together with the Risk Dashboard, the EBA published the results of its Risk Assessment Questionnaire, which includes the opinions of banks and market analysts on the risk outlook between April and May this year. \t\u00a0 \tIn the first quarter of 2017, EU banks' common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio remained high, albeit a modest decrease of 10 basis points (bps) to 14.1% was observed. This effect was mainly driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets, which is partially offset by an increase of capital (\"other reserves\"). \t\u00a0 \tThe ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) maintained a modest downward trend, decreasing by 30bps to 4.8%, and suggesting that supervisory efforts are bearing fruit, albeit slowly. Looking forward, the Risk Assessment Questionnaire shows that more than 50% of the banks expect a stable level of impairment provisions in the next 12 to 18 months, while almost 30% expect impairment provisions to decrease. Banks and market analysts also expect increases in the quality and volumes of lending, to small and medium-sized enterprises and residential mortgages.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe annualised return on equity (ROE) increased by 3.5 percentage points (p.p.) to 6.8% from a low point of 3.1% in the last quarter of 2016.

However, the analysis finds that the method allows too much flexibility, which may need to be revisited in the future;Some areas may require more consistency in relation to the balance between consistent application of the Guidelines across the Member States and the flexibility to cater to national specificities;There seems to be no specific need to amend the Guidelines to enhance transparency to stakeholders. The methodology does not seem to lead to excessive additional reporting requirements.The preliminary conclusions of the EBA assessment are currently based on limited experience of operating risk-based contributions systems among most DGSs.

Further analysis reflecting this data and greater experience of the risk-based systems will be needed ahead of proposing changes to the Guidelines.Consultation processComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

In its Opinion, while agreeing with the aims sought in the EC's amendments, the EBA voices its disagreement with three of the four concrete amendments the Commission proposes on the basis that it would negatively impact the fine trade-off and balances previously found in the RTS. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA's draft RTS, published in February, sought to establish the legislative framework as mandated under PSD2 and to contribute to confidence and trust in the new payment services that PSD2 will bring about from 13 January 2018. In the process of developing the RTS, the EBA had to make difficult trade-offs between the various, at times competing, objectives of the PSD2, such as enhancing security, promoting customer convenience, ensuring technology and business-model neutrality, contributing to the integration of the European payment markets, protecting consumers, facilitating innovation, and enhancing competition through new payment initiation and account information services.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn its letter dated 24 May 2017, the Commission expressed its intention to amend the EBA's draft RTS in four main areas. These included the proposal for the audits to be performed by statutory auditors; an additional, standalone exemption to be added for specific types of corporate transactions; for payment service providers to report the outcome of the monitoring and calculation of the fraud rate to the EBA; and, finally, to require Account Servicing Payment Service Providers (ASPSPs) that have set up a dedicated interface to ensure that Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) and Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) can access the ASPSP's customer interface as a fall-back in case the dedicated interface is not performing as required under the RTS. \t\u00a0 \tWhile the EBA agrees with the aims sought in the European Commission's amendments, the EBA disagrees with some of the means by which the Commission is proposing to achieve that aim. More specifically, the EBA disagrees with three of the four proposed amendments and is of the view that the suggested changes would negatively impact the fine trade-off previously found by the EBA in achieving the various competing objectives of the PSD2. With that in mind, the EBA is suggesting in its Opinion some alternative means through which the Commission's aims can be achieved.\u00a0 \tNext Steps \tThe publication and submission to the EU Commission of today's Opinion concludes the EBA's work on this regulatory mandate. It is now for the EU Commission to make the final decision on the text of the RTS and to adopt the standards as a delegated Act in the Official Journal of the EU. During the adoption process, the EU Council and EU Parliament have a scrutiny right. Once the RTS have been published in the Official Journal, they will enter into force the following day and will apply 18 months after that date. \tLegal basis and background \tThe draft RTS have been developed according to Article 98 of the revised Payment Services Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (PSD2), which mandates the EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, to draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) specifying the requirements of the strong customer authentication (SCA), the exemptions from the application of SCA, the requirements with which security measures have to comply in order to protect the confidentiality and the integrity of the payment service users' personalised security credentials, and the requirements for common and secure open standards of communication (CSC) between account servicing payment service providers, payment initiation service providers, account information service providers, payers, payees and other payment service providers (PSPs). \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA published its final draft report in February 2017, following 18 months of intensive policy development work and consultation with the different payment market players. \t\u00a0 \tWith today's Opinion, the EBA exercise its competence under Article 10 of the EBA Founding Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010), which mandates the EBA to deliver an Opinion on the Commission's proposed amendments to the RTS as well as revised RTS within six weeks of receiving the EC's letter.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-its-opinion-in-response-to-the-european-commission-intention-to-amend-the-eba-technical-standards-for-open-and-secure-electronic-payment"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0682", "date": "2017-06-28", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes 2017 consumer trends report", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its annual consumer trends report for 2017. The Report covers the retail banking products that fall in the EBA's consumer protection mandate, including mortgages, personal loans, deposits, payment accounts, payment services and electronic money. The report also provides an overview of the topical issues identified in 2017 that may impact consumers and other market participants, namely indebtedness, banking fees and costs, selling practices, innovation in payments, foreign currency loans, alternative financial services providers, and innovative uses of consumer data. \t\u00a0 \tIn its continued monitoring effort on the retail banking products, the EBA has observed that mortgages continue to have the biggest impact on consumers, though consumer credit has seen a rapid increase in demand. Nevertheless, consumers tend to complain to their national competent authorities mainly about payment accounts and payment services. \t\u00a0 \tDue to the low interest rate environment, the EBA has observed a gradual increase in the level of indebtedness across the EU as well the introduction of new or the increase in already existing fees and charges on payment accounts and loans. Security of innovative payment instruments and solutions was also highlighted as an important issue for consumers. On the other hand, issues such as selling practices and foreign currency loans, while still relevant for consumers, showed a slight decrease in importance. \t\u00a0 \tThe report also summarises, where relevant, the measures the EBA has taken to address some of the identified issues, including technical standards and guidelines relating to the security of payment transactions, the transparency and disclosure of information on payment accounts, the mis-selling of financial products. \tThis Report builds on information provided by the national competent authorities of the 28 EU Member States, as well as on input received from a selection of national consumer associations and the EBA Banking Stakeholder Group.

The Report concludes that no additional, industry-specific legislative or regulatory requirements are needed at present, but the EBA will continue to monitor closely this innovation. The Report encourages cooperation between supervisory authorities across all relevant policy areas and contributes to fostering a consistent supervisory approach to innovation in the financial sector. \tThe EBA had observed that a growing number of financial institutions use consumer data in innovative ways, often combining data that they hold internally with data obtained from external data vendors, social media or other external sources. \t\u00a0 \tAfter assessing the responses to a Discussion Paper it had published last year, and having carried out an extensive review of a number of EU directives and regulations that apply to the use of consumer data, the EBA considers that there is already an extensive set of legal requirements financial institutions must comply with, which mitigate many of the risks identified by the EBA. \t\u00a0 \tAmong these, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will provide a comprehensive legal framework on the processing of personal data applicable to all providers that process personal data of EU individuals, and financial institutions are expected to take all necessary measures to comply with its provisions by the date of its application (25 May 2018). The Report, therefore, concludes that no additional industry-specific legislative interventions are required at this stage, but, given the growth potential of this innovation, the EBA will continue to monitor closely its evolution.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe Report acknowledges that further work will be carried out in 2017 jointly with ESMA and EIOPA on the topic of Big Data, and that the three European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA) will publish their conclusions on this particular topic within the context of the Joint Committee work.\u00a0 \tLegal basis \tThe EBA is mandated under Article 9 of its founding Regulation to monitor financial innovation across the EU and to foster a consistent supervisory approach to innovation in the financial sector. \t\u00a0 \tFollowing a preliminary analysis of the particular innovation of the use of consumer data by financial institutions, the EBA published, on 4 May 2016, a Discussion Paper (DP) that presented the EBA's preliminary assessment on the topic. The DP asked market participants to comment on whether the EBA's analysis fairly reflected current market practices, in order to allow the EBA to make a better informed decision on what regulatory and/or supervisory response, if any, the EBA should take or propose.

The exercise will cover 70% of the EU banking sector and will assess EU banks' ability to meet relevant supervisory capital ratios during an adverse economic shock. \u00a0The methodology covers all relevant risk areas and, for the first time, will incorporate IFRS 9 accounting standards. The results will inform the 2018 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), challenging banks' capital plans and leading to relevant supervisory outcomes. \u00a0The exercise will also provide enhanced transparency so that market participants can compare and assess the resilience of EU banks on a consistent basis. The list of institutions participating in the exercise is also released today. \t\u00a0 \tThe 2018 EU-wide stress test will be carried out at the highest level of consolidation on a sample of 49 EU banks, 35 of which falling under the jurisdiction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). No single capital threshold is defined for this exercise as banks will be assessed against relevant supervisory capital ratios under a static balance sheet and the results will be an input to the SREP, under which decisions are made on appropriate capital resources and forward looking capital plans. \t\u00a0 \tFor banks starting to report under IFRS 9 in 2018, the 2018 EU-wide stress test takes into account the impact of the implementation of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 both in terms of starting point and projections. \t\u00a0 \tThe final methodology will be published as the exercise is launched, at the beginning of 2018, and the results to be published in mid-year 2018. \tNotes to editors Objective and approach \tThe objective of the EU-wide stress test is to provide supervisors, banks and other market participants with a common analytical framework to consistently compare and assess the resilience of EU banks and the EU banking system to shocks, and to challenge the capital position of EU banks. The exercise is based on a common methodology and a set of templates that capture starting point data and stress test results. The resilience of EU banks will be assessed against a macroeconomic baseline and adverse scenario based on year-end 2017 figures, and applied over a period of three years. The approach of the exercise is again that of constrained bottom-up stress test, where banks will be required to project the impact of the scenarios on their projected P&L and capital position but subject to strict constraints defined in the common methodology \u2013 for instance simplifying assumptions on the projection of credit risk losses under IFRS 9 and setting a cap on projected net interest income. \t\u00a0 Methodology and templates \tSimilar to the 2016 exercise, the 2018 EU-wide stress test is primarily focused on the assessment of the impact of risk drivers on the solvency of banks. Banks are required to stress test a common set of risks (credit risk \u2013 including securitisations \u2013 market risk and counterparty credit risk, operational risk \u2013 including conduct risk). In addition, banks are requested to project the effect of the scenarios on net interest income and to stress P&L and capital items not covered by other risk types. The current draft methodology can be seen as a continuation of the 2016 approach, with the adjustments identified after the IFRS 9 implementation and 2016 lessons learnt. \t\u00a0 \tThe draft methodology is the starting point for an informal discussion with banks so as to receive their input, which will be taken into account when finalising both documents. For this purpose, explicit questions for banks have been included in the draft methodological note for every topic. \t\u00a0 The process \tThe 2018 EU-wide stress test will be run in close cooperation with \u00a0the EBA, Competent Authorities (including the Single Supervisory Mechanism \u2013 SSM), the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the European \u00a0Commission. Scenarios, methodology, minimum quality assurance guidance and templates will be agreed by the EBA's Board of Supervisors. The macroeconomic adverse scenario and any risk type specific shocks linked to the scenario will be developed by the ESRB and the ECB in close cooperation with Competent Authorities and the EBA. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA will coordinate the exercise and will act as the data hub for the dissemination of detailed results on a bank-by-bank level. The EBA will also provide aggregate analyses and tools in line with its commitment to enhancing the transparency of the EU banking sector. \t\u00a0 \tCompetent Authorities will be responsible for conveying the instructions to banks on how to complete the exercise as well as for receiving banks' data. In addition, they will be responsible for validating banks' data and stress test results based on the bottom-up calculation as well as for reviewing the models applied by banks for this purpose. Finally, they will also be responsible for activating any supervisory reaction function, if needed. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-issues-2018-eu-wide-stress-test-methodology-for-discussion"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0695", "date": "2017-05-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESAs consult on technical standards to strengthen group-wide money laundering and terrorist financing risk management", "text": " The Joint Committee of the three European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA - ESAs) launched today a public consultation on draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) specifying how credit and financial institutions should manage money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks where a third country's law prevents the implementation in their branches or majority-owned subsidiaries of group-wide policies and procedures on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).\u200e These RTS are part of the ESAs' wider work on fostering a common approach to AML/CFT and will contribute to creating a level playing field across the Union's financial sector. The consultation runs until 11 July 2017. \t\u00a0 \tCredit and financial institutions have to put in place and maintain AML/CFT policies and procedures to assess and manage effectively the ML/TF risks to which they are exposed. Where they are part of a group, these AML/CFT policies and procedures have to be applied at group-level. This can be challenging where branches or majority-owned subsidiaries are located in a third country, outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), with less stringent AML/CFT requirements. \u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tMost third countries' legal systems will not prevent groups from implementing group-wide AML/CFT policies and procedures that are stricter than national legislation requires. However, \u00a0the implementation of a third country's law may at times not permit the application of some or all parts of a group's AML/CFT policies and procedures. This can be the case, for example, when the sharing of customer-specific information within the group conflicts with local data protection or banking secrecy requirements and limits a credit or financial institution's ability to understand who their customers are. Restrictions on obtaining and processing customer data can also facilitate tax crimes, as highlighted in the context of the \u2018Panama Papers'. \u00a0\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn such cases, credit and financial institutions must take effective steps to handle the resultant ML/TF risk. \u00a0These include obtaining consent from customers to overcome restrictions on the ability to share and process customer data, carrying out enhanced reviews to be satisfied that branches and majority-owned subsidiaries in those jurisdictions are able to adequately assess and manage ML/TF risk and restricting the ability of other entities in the same group to rely on customer due diligence measures carried out by a branch or majority-owned subsidiary in those jurisdictions. \tConsultation process \tComments to the draft RTS can be sent by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the EBA's consultation page.

To ensure that authorities exercise these powers in ways which reduce the risk of costs falling on the taxpayer, preserve value where possible, and respect the property rights of affected shareholders and creditors, the BRRD requires independent valuations to be carried out to inform decisions of the authorities. These valuations are required for several distinct purposes, either prior or after the resolution. \t\u00a0 \tThese final draft RTS specify the valuation principles that shall be followed before and after a resolution occurs.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tValuation before resolution is critical to the resolution process since it informs the resolution authority's decision as to whether the conditions for resolution are met and, if so, which resolution tools should be used. To conduct a valuation before resolution, the independent valuer is empowered to challenge the banks' management assumptions, data, methodologies and judgements on which the institutions prepare their financial statements. \tThe decision on which resolution tools to apply is informed by a fair, prudent and realistic valuation, based on the economic value of assets and liabilities. \t\u00a0 \tValuation after resolution is instrumental to establish whether the no-creditor-worse-off (NCWO) safeguard has been breached by the resolution action and whether any compensation has to be paid to creditors and shareholders by the resolution fund.

The Report highlights the risks to the stability of the European financial sector in an environment subject to political and economic uncertainties. In particular, the protracted period of low profitability of banks and the difficulties faced by insurers to generate adequate returns to meet long-term liabilities in a low growth and low-yield environment remains a major challenge. In addition, the steepening of the yield curve may benefit earnings across all sectors but it also raises valuation concerns and, in the short term, may not be sufficient to alleviate the low profitability concerns. The Report also highlights the high valuation risk linked to search for yield strategies and repricing of risk premia. Rising operational risks related to information and communication technologies are increasingly requiring supervisory attention.\u00a0 \tLow profitability of financial institutions \tHigh levels of non-performing loans (NPLs), continuously high litigation costs, overcapacity, and lack of focus in strategies to return to sustained profitability affect the banking sector, notwithstanding a further steady strengthening of the capital ratios. Addressing NPL challenges requires a comprehensive and coordinated European response, including stepping up supervisory action, making progress in structural reforms, and improving the efficiency of secondary markets. Insurers face substantial challenges arising from prolonged low interest rates, especially those with material exposures to life insurance contracts with interest rate guarantees. In the European Union's fund industry, rates of returns are subdued and remained mostly negative. \tValuation risks around search for yield and repricing of risk premia \tIncreased asset price volatility coupled with lingering liquidity concerns has heightened risks around the adequate valuation of asset prices. Risks are exacerbated by political uncertainties. As a matter of fact, the recently observed steepening of the yield curve, while benefitting the profitability of banks, insurers and pension funds, poses additional valuation concerns. For the insurance sector, a sudden substantial increase of the interest rate might expose companies to an increasing probability of lapses.\u00a0 \tInterconnectedness within the financial system \tInterconnectedness, in particular via asset price contagion and direct financial exposure, adds to financial sector risks. Highly correlated equity price movements for insurers and banks, and high exposures of EU insurers to EU banks indicate risk concentration within those two sectors. Persistent search for yield intensifies the potential of price contagion among risky asset classes and reinforces valuation risk. Interconnectedness with the wider financial system is also on the rise, as cross-sectoral exposures, asset price commonalities and the interdependency of business processes increase.\u00a0 \tCyber risks and IT-related operational risks \tFast technological change is expected to have a significant impact on the existing business models of financial institutions over time. Many financial intermediaries have to deal with ageing core IT systems, hence the need for extensive IT investments, which further aggravate profitability. In addition, cyber risk threatens data integrity and business continuity in an interconnected financial system. Against this background, the demand for cyber insurance is expected to grow while cyber coverage products are still relatively new in the market, with limited underwriting experiences. Unlike other types of insurance, there is a severe lack of historical data that can be used for pricing purposes. The ESAs are responding to cyber and IT-related risks by, e.g., drafting Guidelines on ICT risk assessment for supervisors, assessing cyber security capabilities of central counterparties (CCPs) and assessing the potential accumulation of risk at insurers deriving from newly developed cyber security coverages. \tNotes for Editors \tThe Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1 January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \t\u00a0 \tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices.

These Guidelines complement existing regulation and guidance to facilitate the use of the bail-in power as a way of absorbing losses and recapitalising banks in resolution. In particular the Guidelines clarify how valuation information should help determine the terms of bail-in. \t\u00a0 \tThe first set of Guidelines focuses on conversion rates in bail-in. It highlights guiding principles resolution authorities are to apply when setting debt-to-equity conversion rates both in a bail-in context, or when the power to write down and convert capital instruments is not applied in conjunction with any resolution tool. These Guidelines point out the role of the valuation of assets and liabilities of failing institutions, mandated by the BRRD, in defining the expected value of the combined equity and debt claim after resolution, and their expected value in the hypothetical case the institution had entered normal insolvency proceedings. \u00a0In addition, the Guidelines clarify when to set differential conversion rates for different classes of creditors. \t\u00a0 \tThe second set of Guidelines deals with the treatment of shareholders. It aims at clarifying the circumstances under which it is appropriate to cancel, transfer, or severely dilute shares or other instruments of ownership. In particular, resolution authorities should only favour dilution over cancellation where the net asset value of the institution is positive under the ex-ante valuation. Where more than one choice (cancellation, dilution or transfer) is available to Resolution authorities, the choice should be guided by the need to meet the resolution objectives. In this regard, national or EU company law may affect the appropriate choice, for example shares with special voting rights might be more appropriate to cancel than to transferor a transfer of shares of a listed company would avoid an interruption of listing. \t\u00a0 \tThe third set of Guidelines on the interrelationship between the BRRD and the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) clarifies the treatment of instruments which meet the criteria for recognition as AT1 as per Article 52 of the CRR but are progressively grandfathered as per Article 484 of that Regulation due to the fact that they do not contain a Point Of Non-Viability (PONV) clause. These Guidelines prescribe that these instruments should be treated identically to AT1 instruments. In addition, they clarify the treatment of T2 instruments, which are progressively amortised in the final five years of residual maturity as per Article 64 of the CRR. Finally, these guidelines prescribe that the Resolution Authority should treat those instruments in the same way as T2 instruments included in the same class. \tLegal basis\u00a0 \tThese Guidelines have been developed according to Article 47, 48 and 50 of the BRRD and are addressed to Resolution Authorities.

These Guidelines are part of the ESAs' wider work on fostering a common approach to Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) and promote a common understanding of payment service providers' obligations in this area. This is essential to ensure the consistent application of AML/CFT law, which not only strengthens the European Union's AML/CFT regime but is also a prerequisite for the smooth and efficient functioning of payment systems. The consultation runs until 5 June 2017.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tTransfers of funds can be abused for terrorist financing and money laundering purposes. To prevent such abuse, and to detect it should it occur, payment service providers must be able to establish who sends and receives these funds. European legislation, therefore, requires that specific information on payers and payees is passed on along the payment chain and makes payment service providers responsible for ensuring that this is done.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe ESAs' draft joint guidelines set out what intermediary payment service providers and the payment service providers of the payee should do to detect whether information on the payer or the payee is missing or is incomplete. They also set out what payment service providers should do to manage a transfer of funds that lacks the required information.\u00a0 \tThe ESAs promote the development of a common understanding, by payment service providers and competent authorities across the European Union, of what effective procedures to detect and manage transfers of funds that lack required information on the payer and the payee are, and how they should be applied. \tConsultation process \tComments to the draft Guidelines can be sent by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the EBA's consultation page.

The Report highlighted a number of achievements made by colleges in the course of 2016, including a good level and quality of engagement, and also identified areas for improvement as well as topics for supervisory attention for 2017. The Report relied on the EBA staff observations gained through their participation in colleges of supervisors and on the consolidated results of the individual college assessments conducted at the end of 2016.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tOverall, the Report concluded that the level and quality of engagements in supervisory colleges have been further improved in 2016, in particular the quality and depth of the discussions. \tThe EBA staff observed that the group risk assessment reports, one of the key deliverables of colleges, provided a good overview of risk profiles, with all material risks being captured and a sufficient level of details included. Improvements are expected in the completion and sharing of the decomposition of capital requirements by individual risks. \t\u00a0 \tIn addition, the Report highlighted that the joint decision documents on capital and liquidity, which are the ultimate outcomes of colleges work, were well reasoned and contained information on and references to the conclusions of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), as reflected in the group risk/liquidity risk assessment reports. The articulation of the own funds requirements (P2R) in the 2016 capital joint decision documents have been brought more in line with the SREP guidelines. In terms of the joint decision process, colleges have to ensure that substantial information is shared with college members in a timely manner. \t\u00a0 \tSupervisory colleges were required, for the second year in a row, to assess group recovery plans for cross-border banking groups and to reach joint decisions in 2016. Securing a formal agreement was challenging in many colleges, as they had to deal with issues arising from the treatment of pre-existing individual recovery plans, which had been developed before the BRRD came into force, and the appropriate coverage of individual entities in the group recovery plans. These issues have led to delays in reaching a joint decision, to a partial decision or to a situation in which no joint decision could be reached. \t\u00a0 \tAmong the items which deserve supervisory attention in 2017 are the ongoing balance sheet cleaning and NPLs reduction for legacy portfolios and the sustainability of banks' business models.\u00a0 \tFor the first time, the report includes detailed information on the activity of colleges followed on a thematic and selected basis.\u00a0 \tThe tools the EBA applies to facilitate the effective functioning of colleges as well as the support and guidance the EBA provides to colleges throughout the entire joint decision cycle are also explained in the Report.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tNotes to the editors \t\t\tColleges of supervisors are fundamental for the effective supervision of EU cross-border banking groups, as they bring together supervisors, for developing group risk assessments and reaching joint decisions on institutions' capital and liquidity requirements under Pillar 2 as well as on the assessment of institutions' group recovery plans.

The initiative was relaunched as \"Vienna 2\" in January 2012 in response to renewed risks for the region from the Eurozone crisis. Its focus is now on fostering home and host authority coordination in support of stable cross-border banking. \t\u00a0 \tThe Vienna Initiative Forum also looked into investment dynamics, priorities and constraints in the region and discussed how new instruments provided by the international financial institutions, focusing on environment, infrastructure, innovation and SMEs can supplement existing funding models. The Vienna Initiative will study further the design of financial instruments to support investment in the CESEE region and beyond. \t\u00a0 \tA further topic, which was discussed in Luxembourg, was the recent evolution of bank regulation in home countries and at the global level. The Forum discussed the issue of unintended impediments to cross-border banking due to prudential restrictions on the cross-border flow of capital and liquidity within banking groups. The commercial bank group participants also noted that the increasing number of national regulatory initiatives in some CESEE countries have had some unintended negative consequences. The Forum received an update on the Non-performing loans (NPL) Initiative work-stream of the Vienna Initiative, which reported substantial achievements in enhancing the transparency of restructuring frameworks, building capacity through coordinated technical assistance, and sharing knowledge. All of this has partly led to a recent abatement of NPLs in the region and has helped to deepen the secondary market for NPLs, with sales of NPLs reaching EUR 7.3 billion over the last eighteen months. The Forum also discussed recent NPL dynamics and regulatory moves at the European Union level. \t\u00a0 \tThe Forum also took note of the fact that the economies of the region all showed fairly strong growth in 2016, and that this is expected to continue in 2017. Banking developments have supported this positive outcome. Overall deleveraging by parent banks, which started more markedly in 2011, has now largely come to an end, while domestic deposits have been growing, thus ensuring banks operating in the region have sufficient funding, while becoming less dependent on parent bank funding. Boris Vuj\u010di\u0107, Governor of the Croatian National Bank and recently appointed Chairman of the Vienna Initiative Steering Committee stressed: \"The Vienna Initiative has been important in helping the countries of the regions and their banking systems to cope with the changing pressures of recent years. I am confident that the current work priorities \u2013 monitoring funding in the region, adapting to the Banking and Capital Market Unions, broadening the successful work on NPLs, and mobilizing new investment instruments \u2013 will continue to provide substantial benefits to all participants in the period ahead.\"\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tFor additional information and the latest publications visit: www.vienna-initiative.com. \t\u00a0 \tParticipants of the Full Forum included representatives of Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine; major bank groups operating emerging Europe: Erste, Intesa Sanpaolo, KBC, Raiffeisen, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Gen\u00e9rale, and UniCredit, National Bank Greece, Eurobank; as well as the European Commission, the European Council, the EBRD, the EIB, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank Group.

These templates are designed to show the amounts of encumbered and unencumbered assets of an institution and differentiate between assets that are needed to support existing funding or collateral needs and those that are available for potential funding needs.

The reports cover residential mortgage, SME and other corporate portfolios (collectively referred to as \"high default portfolios\" - HDP), as well as market risk. The results confirm previous findings and establish these annual benchmarking exercises as a fundamental supervisory tool to restoring trust in internal models. \t\u00a0 \tFindings and next steps of the HDP exercise \t\u00a0 \tThe HDP report explains the overall level of variability in RWAs and examines the different drivers that explain the dispersion observed. Most of the results are broadly in line with previous exercises on HDP. Given the different approaches used, namely a top-down and an outturn (backtesting) approach, in addition to a distribution analysis, the respective findings should be read concurrently. Two indicators are used to summarise the results, the RW and the \u2018global charge' (GC, i.e. considering expected and unexpected losses). \t\u00a0 \tA key finding from the top-down approach is that more than 80% of the observed difference in the GC levels across institutions could be explained by few drivers, namely: the proportion of defaulted exposures in the portfolio; the country of the counterparty; and the portfolio mix. The remaining variability could be attributed to differences in riskiness \u2013 i.e., idiosyncratic portfolio features, modelling assumptions and risk management practices used by banks, as well as supervisory practices. backtesting approach shows that, in general, the estimated values for PDs and LGDs are above the observed values for defaults and loss rates. Nevertheless, some banks systematically show observed values higher than estimates and will need a closer analysis. \t\u00a0 \tThis exercise highlighted several areas in which supervisors \u2013 and colleges \u2013 should investigate further, for instance: the practices regarding defaulted exposures; the definition of default; the use of global models and the interaction with country-specificities for exposures with counterparties from different jurisdictions; unjustified differences between regulatory approaches and possible compensation effects between internal approaches. \tFindings and next steps of the Market Risk exercise \tThe market risk report presents the observed variability measures in terms of the inter-quantile dispersion statistic (IQD). In the initial market valuation results, interest rate portfolios show a lower variability than other asset classes due to a more homogeneity across banks for modelling interest rate risk. In line with the previous exercises on market risk weighted assets variability, a significant dispersion for all the risk measures provided by banks is observed. As expected, the overall variability for Value at Risk (VaR) is lower than that observed for Stressed VaR (sVaR) and more sophisticated measures like Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) and All Price Risk (APR) show a much higher level of dispersion. Modelling choices play an important role in explaining this variability, especially for the most complex risk measures. \t\u00a0 \tThis report highlights some areas that may require further investigations by Competent Authorities, such as accentuated pricing variability for equity derivatives, commodities trades and credit spreads products. \tNote to the editors\u00a0 \tThese annual benchmarking exercises are contributing to the work the EBA is conducting for improving the regulatory framework and restoring confidence in internal models. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA is exploring a number of options and publishing guidelines to address specific concerns, such as the report specifying the methodology assessment that competent authorities shall follow when assessing the compliance of an institution with the requirements to use the IRB approach or the guidelines on application of the definition of default.

Such criteria should help institutions avoid a fragmented approach in providing information in recovery plans, and provide a common guidance for home and host supervisors. The consultation runs until 02 June 2017. \t\u00a0 \tThe draft Recommendation envisages that the coverage of entities in a group recovery plan needs to be proportional, so that the amount of information will vary according to relevance of the entities. The EBA, therefore, recommends that \u2013 for recovery planning purposes - entities should be categorised as (i) relevant for the group, (ii) relevant for the economy or financial system of a relevant member state or (iii) not relevant for neither of the two. Different levels of information are identified for each category. \u00a0A transitional phase is included to allow the incorporation of available information from existing individual plans into group plans. \t\u00a0 \tWhile the draft Recommendation does not interfere with the tasks and responsibilities of the home and host Competent Authorities under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), it is designed to limit requests for individual plans, based on an inadequate coverage of an entity in the group recovery plans.

The focus of this comparative analysis is recovery options, which are crucial for assessing institutions' actual capacity to regain viability following a period of severe financial distress. Overall, recovery plans in the sample provided a good overview of recovery options and clear improvements were seen across the board, although some challenges still remain. This benchmarking exercise aims at supporting supervisors in their assessment to identify the crucial elements that banks should consider when designing and selecting credible recovery options. \t\u00a0 \tThe analysis showed that in the vast majority of cases, banks have well understood the importance of having a detailed analysis of options in their recovery plans. Taking into account the good progress already made so far in providing a good range of credible and feasible recovery options that could restore the viability of an institution in a situation of financial distress, there are still areas for improvement and some specific issues that might need further developments. \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the Report observed that the credibility and effectiveness of recovery plans could benefit greatly from a more detailed analysis of the links between recovery options and governance arrangements, and of the feasibility of options under each scenario. It should be noted that, while all plans provided a financial impact assessment on key supervisory ratios, a number of recovery plans did not provide enough information on the assumptions used to support the valuation of options. Finally, coverage and integration of material legal entities seems to be still a challenging task across the majority of recovery plans.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThis analysis will feed into the policy recommendations on the coverage of entities in banking group recovery plans that the EBA is currently consulting on. \tNotes to editors \tIn accordance with its role in contributing to effective recovery and resolution planning, the EBA has conducted a fourth thematic comparative analysis on 23 recovery plans across the EU with a focus on recovery options. \t\u00a0 \tFor a recovery plan to be effective, among other things, it should also provide a good range of recovery options that could restore the viability of the bank or of the group in situation of financial distress.

In the feedback table published today as part of the RTS, the EBA has summarised each one of them and provided its assessment as to whether changes have been made to the RTS as a result of such concerns.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, one of the key concerns addressed by these final draft RTS relates to the exemptions from the application of strong customer authentication on the basis of the level of risk involved in the service provided; the amount and recurrence of the transaction; and the payment channel used for the execution of the transaction. In this respect, the EBA has introduced two new exemptions: one based on transaction-risk analysis based on defined fraud levels and the other for payments at so called \u2018unattended terminals' for transport or parking fares. The exemption on transaction risk analysis is linked to a predefined level of fraud and is subject to an 18-month review clause after the application date of the RTS.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn addition, the EBA has also increased the threshold for remote payment transactions from EUR 10 to EUR 30, and has removed previous references to ISO 27001 and to other specific characteristics of strong customer authentication, so as better to ensure the technological neutrality of the RTS and to facilitate future innovations. \u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tWith regards to the communication between account servicing payment service providers (ASPSPs), account Information service providers (AISPs) and payment initiation service providers (PISPs), the EBA has decided to maintain the obligation for the ASPSPs to offer at least one interface for AISPs and PISPs to access payment account information. This is linked to the PSD2 no longer allowing the existing practice of third party access without identification (at times referred to as \u2018screen scraping' or, mistakenly, as \u2018direct access') once the transition period provided for in PSD2 has elapsed and the RTS applies.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tHowever, in order to address the concerns raised by a few respondents, the final RTS now also require that ASPSPs that use a dedicated interface will have to provide the same level of availability and performance as the interface offered to, and used by, their own customers, provide the same level of contingency measures in case of unplanned unavailability, and provide an immediate response to PISPs on whether or not the customer has funds available to make a payment. \t\u00a0 \tLegal basis and background \tThe draft RTS have been developed according to Article 98 of the revised Payment Services Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (PSD2), which mandates the EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, to draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) specifying the requirements of the strong customer authentication (SCA), the exemptions from the application of SCA, the requirements with which security measures have to comply in order to protect the confidentiality and the integrity of the payment service users' personalised security credentials, and the requirements for common and secure open standards of communication (CSC) between account servicing payment service providers, payment initiation service providers, account information service providers, payers, payees and other payment service providers (PSPs). \tThe PSD2 provides that the RTS will apply 18 months after adoption of the RTS by the EU Commission as a Delegated Act.

In addition, this Report may inform the European Commission's currently ongoing reviews of the EU micro- and macro-prudential frameworks and could serve as a valuable complementary contribution to the global discussions about the bank capital regulatory framework.\u00a0 \tIncreased risk-sensitivity of the bank capital regulatory framework raises the concern whether resulting regulatory capital requirements tend to be pro-cyclical, e.g. contribute to mutually reinforcing feedback loops between the financial system and real economic developments. \tFindings\u00a0 \tAgainst the background of considerable challenges to empirically identify with sufficient certainty the relationship between risk-sensitive regulatory capital and the amplitude of the economic cycle, the key conclusions of the Report are the following:\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \t\tBanks' capital requirements, since 2008, appear to have developed relatively stable and series on banks' IRB risk parameters (Probability of Default, Loss Given Default, default ratio) do not show a particularly cyclical pattern. \t\tThe surprising lack of a strong correlation between the economic cycle and banks' risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and underlying parameters is evident in various regression specifications at bank and portfolio level.\u00a0 \t\tHigher capital requirements due to CRD/CRR could have exerted some restricting impact on banks' loan supply, but in the period observed (after 2008), results indicate that it is likely that broader macroeconomic and financial factors had a predominant impact on banks' lending decisions. \t\tFurther econometric analysis provided only limited evidence of any significant pro-cyclical effect induced by the regulatory framework on the real economy. \tRecommendations \tAgainst the background of the weak evidence on the existence of pro-cyclical effects due to the CRDIV/CRR framework, this Report recommends that the EU retains its current risk-sensitive framework for bank regulatory capital.

The Report shows a constant improvement of the average LCR across EU banks since 2011. At the reporting date of 31 December 2015, EU banks' average LCR was significantly above the 100% minimum requirement, which will have to be fully implemented by January 2018, and no strong evidence was found suggesting that the EBA should recommend an extension of the phasing-in period of the LCR. The Report, which is based on liquidity data from 194 EU banks across 17 Member States, is the first publication after the implementation of the minimum binding standards in 2015 and accounts for the provisions of the Commission's Delegated Regulation on the LCR. \tKey findings \tThe Report shows that as of end-December 2015, EU banks' average LCR was 134% and the aggregate gross shortfall amounted to EUR 10.9 billion. The increase in the LCR can be mainly attributed to an increase in liquid assets, which, since June 2011, have almost doubled. In contrast, net cash outflows have remained relatively stable. In addition, the Report shows that, on average, banks in various business models reach the 100% minimum requirement, despite large dispersions amongst them. \t\u00a0 \tThe Report also provides a quantitative analysis on the comparison between the LCR under the Commission's Delegated Regulation and the LCR under the Basel III framework. Overall, the findings show that, under the Delegated Regulation, smaller banks (Group 2 banks) and specialised credit institutions, such as automotive and consumer credit banks, benefit from the EU-specific rules, while the average LCR for large cross-border universal banks (Group 1 banks) is lower with respect to the Basel III framework.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe Report further analyses operations with central banks and identifies, in particular, the importance of central bank exposures in banks' liquidity buffers for their compliance with the LCR regulation.

The Report quantifies the current MREL stack and estimates potential financing needs of European Union (EU) banks under various scenarios. It also assesses the possible macroeconomic costs and benefits of introducing MREL in the EU. Finally, the Report recommends a number of changes to reinforce the MREL framework and integrate the international standards on total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) in the EU's MREL.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 The Report is addressed to the European Commission, which issued its banking reform package on 23 November 2016.

The Report promotes a technically sound implementation of international standards as part of an integrated EU framework in order to avoid banks being faced with two sets of rules. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tThe recommendations include, inter alia, the following key elements: \t\t\u00a0 Reaffirming resolution strategies as the primary driver of MREL calibration \t\tMREL should respect the minimum quantitative requirements laid down in the TLAC term sheet for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) but should also deliver on the resolution strategy for each firm. Therefore, for G-SIBs, MREL should be set as the higher of minimum quantitative requirements and the amount necessary to meet the resolution strategy of any specific firm. \t\t\u00a0 Enhancing resolvability by introducing mandatory subordination requirements \t\tG-SIBs should be subject to a partial subordination requirement of at least 14.5% of RWAs, in line with the Financial Stability Board (FSB) TLAC term sheet. Other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) could be subject to a partial subordination requirement of 13.5% of risk weighted assets (RWAs) with some flexibility to cater for market capacity and differences in resolution strategies. \t\t\u00a0 Improving consistency between MREL and capital requirements \t\tMREL requirements should be expressed as a percentage of RWAs, with a leverage ratio exposure backstop. In order to preserve the usability of capital buffers, CET1 should be prevented from counting towards MREL and capital buffers at the same time. Suggestions are provided to clarify the stacking order between MREL and capital buffers, avoiding that a breach of the MREL requirement can immediately and automatically lead to constraints to distributions. \t\t\u00a0 Enhancing transparency to support market discipline and facilitate the emergence of a market for MREL instruments \t\tCredit institutions should be required to disclose MREL requirements and stacks in the steady phase. During the transitional phase of MREL build-up, they should be required to disclose at least MREL stacks and information on the creditor hierarchy. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tLegal basis \t\tThis final MREL report has been drafted in accordance with Articles 45(19) and (20) of the BRRD, which mandate the EBA to deliver a report on the implementation of MREL to the European Commission by 31 October 2016. The EBA submitted an interim report to the Commission on 19 July 2016 in order to provide timely input into the Commission's legislative proposal on loss absorbing and recapitalisation capacity. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tNotes to editors \t\t\tMREL is a requirement for a bank to hold a sufficient amount of own funds and debt instruments of a certain quality in order to absorb losses and recapitalise its critical functions in case of failure. This requirement is to be set for each bank by the relevant resolution authorities in line with the BRRD and regulatory standards developed by the EBA in 2015. \t\t\t\u200eMREL is an essential complement to ensure the effective application of the bail-in mechanism, as laid down by the BRRD. Bail-in ensures that the costs of a bank's failure are borne, first and foremost, by shareholders and creditors rather than taxpayers. Bail-in became applicable in all EU Member States as of 1 January 2016 and resolution authorities are working to progressively set MREL requirements as part of the ongoing resolution planning process. \t\t\tTotal loss-absorbing capacity is a regulatory standard introduced by the FSB in November 2015. It is applicable to G-SIBs and pursues the same objectives as MREL, i.e. ensuring sufficient loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity when resolving a bank.

The consultation runs until 7 March 2017. \t\u00a0 \tThe draft Guidelines set out the criteria, thresholds and methodology to be used by payment service providers in order to determine whether an operational or security incident should be considered as major and, therefore, be notified to the CAs. These draft Guidelines also establish the template that payment service providers will have to use for this notification and the reports they have to send during the lifecycle of the incident, including the timeframe for reporting the incident. \t\u00a0 \tFurthermore, these draft Guidelines define a set of criteria that Competent Authorities have to use as primary indicators when assessing the relevance of a major operational or security incident to other domestic authorities. In particular, they detail the information that, as a minimum, Competent Authorities should share with other domestic authorities when an incident is considered of relevance for the latter. \tConsultation process \tResponses to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the website. \t\u00a0 \tAll contributions received will be published following the close of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.

The report is accompanied by the EBA's 2016 transparency exercise, which provides essential data, in a comparable and accessible format, for 131 banks across the EU. Overall, banks have further strengthened their capital position, allowing them to continue the process of repair. The report identifies as the key challenges in that process the remaining high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) and sustained low profitability. Operational risks also appear to be on the rise and volatility in funding markets remains high. \t\t\t\t\t\u00a0CET1 ratio \t\t\t\t\t\u00a0NPL ratio \t\t\t\t\t\u00a0Coverage ratio \t\t\t\t\t\u00a0RoE \t\t\t\t\t\u00a013.6% \t\t\t\t\t\u00a05.4% \t\t\t\t\t\u00a043.8% \t\t\t\t\t\u00a05.7% (data as of Q2 2016) \tThe strengthening of European banks' solvency, initiated in 2011, has continued. The common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio, computed on a transitional basis, increased by 80bp between June 2015 and June 2016, to 13.6 %. The fully loaded CET1 ratio was 12.1 % in June 2015 and 13.2 % in June this year. The continuous increase in common equity is the main driver for the improvement in banks' capital position. Supervisory restrictions on dividends have also boosted retained earnings, despite the low profitability environment. \tThe NPL ratio decreased to 5.4% in the second half of 2016 from 6.5% at the end of 2014. While there are signs of potential improvements, asset quality is still weak compared to historical figures and other regions. Material differences persist in asset quality across countries, with more than one third of EU jurisdictions showing NPL ratios above 10%. Further gradual improvements in asset quality are expected by banks and market analysts, but they will strongly depend on how successfully the impediments of NPL resolution will be addressed. Action on NPLs is needed, including supervisory actions, structural reforms and development of secondary markets. \tEU banks reported an average return on equity (RoE) of 5.7% as of June 2016, down by more than 100 basis points (bp) compared to June 2015, albeit it has improved compared to 2015 and 2014 end-of-year data. The decline in profitability was driven by a drop of total operating income by 8.8%. Profitability remains a source of concern in the EU banking system which is confirmed by the fact that the RoE remains below banks' cost of equity (CoE). Information and communication technology related risks are increasing whilst litigation and conduct risk-related concerns remain. Cyber-attacks are on the rise and banks are struggling to demonstrate their ability to cope. In this context, supervisors are focusing on IT-related risks including measures to fix rigid and outdated legacy IT systems, IT resilience and governance and outsourcing. The entry of FinTech competitors is also seen as a challenge and opportunity. The report shows that banks expect compensation and redress payments to remain high. \tWhilst funding costs have been kept low by accommodative monetary policy stances, including central banks' asset purchase programmes, overall issuances of unsecured debt were reduced in the first three quarters of 2016 compared to 2015. Volume reductions in the issuance of subordinated debt were particularly pronounced. Going forward, banks will also have to take into account in their funding plans the need to meet the global standard on total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) and the bank recovery and resolution Directive (BRRD). \tNotes to the editors \t\t\tThe EBA has been conducting transparency exercises at EU-wide level on an annual basis since 2011. Unlike stress tests, transparency exercises are purely disclosure exercises where only bank-by-bank data are published and no shocks are applied to the actual data. \t\t\tThis time the EBA is disclosing, in parallel with its annual Risk Assessment Report, bank-by-bank data for two reference dates, December 2015 and June 2016. The transparency exercise is part of the EBA's ongoing efforts to foster transparency and market discipline in the EU internal market for financial services, and complements banks' own Pillar 3 disclosures, as laid down in the EU's capital requirements directive (CRD). \t\t\tThe sample in the 2016 transparency exercise includes 131 banks at the highest level of consolidation in the EU, from 24 EEA countries. Similar to the Risk Assessment Report, the transparency exercise fully relies on supervisory reporting data. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-sees-high-npl-levels-and-low-profitability-as-the-main-risks-for-eu-banks"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0773", "date": "2016-12-01", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA updates list of CET1 instruments", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its fourth updated list of capital instruments that Competent Supervisory Authorities (CAs) across the European Union (EU) have classified as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1).

Consequently, these RTS will need to be embedded by supervisory authorities in their day-to-day practices. \t\u00a0 \tWhen finalising the RTS, the EBA has been mindful of developments at international level in market risk capital standards. In particular it considered the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published in January 2016.

The proposed draft ITS include additional information on sovereign exposures as the currently available data suffers from several shortcomings, which has required, so far, to resort to ad-hoc collections from Competent Authorities.\u00a0 \u00a0 Considering the significant increase in institutions' costs stemming from operational risk events and the significant impact on profitability, these draft ITS also propose improvements to the reported information on operational risk. These changes will allow supervisors to monitor the losses due to this risk and to analyse the drivers behind the events triggering such material losses. \u00a0 Consultation process Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

This exercise, which helped the EBA understand the way in which institutions are preparing for the application of IFRS 9, also contains some recommendations relevant to the observations as well as some future actions, including the interaction of IFRS 9 with existing prudential requirements. \t\u00a0 \tQualitative and quantitative observations \tOn the qualitative side, the Report highlights that as of December 2015, when the exercise was launched, banks were, overall, still at an early stage of preparation for the implementation of IFRS 9, although larger banks seemed more advanced. Also, the Report shows that many respondents plan to perform parallel runs to test the implementation of IFRS 9, but this testing may, in some cases, be more limited than originally envisaged. It should also be noted that at the time the exercise was carried-out, banks still needed to make some key accounting policy decisions.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tOn the quantitative side, the responses received show that the estimated impact of IFRS 9 is mainly driven by IFRS 9 impairment requirements. The estimated increase of provisions is on average 18% (and up to 30% for 86% of the respondents) compared to the current levels of provisions under IAS 39. The common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratios are expected to decrease on average by up to 59 basis points (bps) (and up to 75 bps for 79% of the respondents). In limited cases the impact of IFRS 9 could be higher. \t\u00a0 \tNext steps and other EU initiatives \tThe EBA will closely monitor the implementation by EU institutions of IFRS 9 over time and also encourages banks to continue their efforts towards a high quality implementation of the stand-ard. To this end, the EBA will continue to engage in an on-going dialogue with banks and auditors and welcomes further discussion with stakeholders on aspects relating to interactions with pru-dential requirements. \t\u00a0 \tFollowing the analysis of the information collected in the first exercise, the EBA is launching a second impact assessment. As banks are expected to have further developed their methodologies towards the implementation of IFRS 9, the new exercise will allow the EBA to better understand the possible impact of IFRS 9 and the way it is being implemented. \t\u00a0 \tIn parallel, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published today a public statement on issues to be considered when implementing IFRS 9, which highlights both the need for consistent, high-quality implementation of IFRS 9 and the need for transparency on its impact to users of financial statements.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-provides-its-views-on-the-implementation-of-ifrs-9-and-its-impact-on-banks-across-the-eu"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0785", "date": "2016-11-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA consults on standards specifying information requirements for the authorisation of credit institutions", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a consultation on (i) regulatory technical standards (RTS) on the information to be provided to Competent Authorities for the authorisation of credit institutions and (ii) implementing technical standards (ITS) on the templates and procedures for the provision of such information.

In particular, the EBA recommends a framework focused on the risks that investment firms pose to customers and to market integrity and liquidity. \t\u00a0 \tTherefore, the EBA is proposing that the ongoing capital requirements shall be calculated based on capital factors (K-factors) that are attributed to one of these two broad types of risks.

The response to the first recommendation on the criteria to identify the class of investment firms for which the prudential regime laid down in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) is applicable was sent to the Commission and published on the EBA website on 20 October 2016. \t\u00a0 \tBased on the evidence received, the EBA plans to finalise its report in response to the Commission's call for advice by mid-2017.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-seeks-views-on-new-prudential-regime-for-investment-firms"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0787", "date": "2016-11-04", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA issues recommendations on the implementation of new counterparty and market risk frameworks", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a Report in response to two calls for advice to assist the European Commission in the adoption into European legislation of two new international frameworks proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS): (i) a new standardised framework for counterparty risk (CCR), i.e. the so-called SA-CCR, and (ii) a new market risk (MKR) framework - the so-called fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB). In the Report, the EBA focuses on the envisaged impact of these two frameworks, for both large and small firms, and issues recommendations on their implementation. \t\u00a0 \tThe Report assesses the impact that the implementation of the two frameworks is likely to have on institutions, both from a qualitative and quantitative perspectives, as well as on certain business lines and/or markets, and highlights a number of interpretative and operational issues that might need to be addressed before the rules are fully implemented. In addition, given the technical complexity that the new requirements might entail, the Report assesses the convenience of introducing greater proportionality into both frameworks. \t\u00a0 \tBased on its assessment, the EBA is including in the Report some recommendations, which are addressed to the European Commission: \t\u00a0 \t\tIncreasing the threshold value for small trading book business below which institutions are able to use the non-trading book approach for the computation of capital requirements. \t\tIntroducing a threshold for small derivative businesses below which institutions are allowed to use simple approaches currently used for the computation of CCR capital requirements, subject to recalibration. \t\tConsidering additional proportionality solutions for banks outside the traditional scope of the Basel standards that could include, for both CCR and MKR purposes, the use of approaches that are simpler and more conservative than the ones developed in Basel. \t\tImplementing large technical parts of these international standards using delegated acts or mandates for Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS), so as to allow the EBA to reflect key changes in the regulation in a timely fashion.\u00a0 \t\tIncluding more granularity in COREP reporting to provide a better overview of institutions' CCR exposures and the information needed to monitor the computation of the different proportionality thresholds included in legislation.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-issues-recommendations-on-the-implementation-of-new-counterparty-and-market-risk-frameworks"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0788", "date": "2016-11-03", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes final guidelines on ICAAP and ILAAP information", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final Guidelines on the collection of information related to the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP).

This report will support the Commission in its review of the large exposures framework as part of the overall CRR review. \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, in the first section, the EBA analyses the impact of aligning certain aspects of the EU large exposures regime with the standards on large exposures produced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). \u00a0In this respect, the EBA considers appropriate to strengthen the large exposures capital base by including only Tier 1 capital instead of allowing also a proportion of Tier 2 capital, as it is currently the case. \t\u00a0 \tThe second section deals with the five exemptions identified in the call for advice, which might be currently used by institutions subject to the discretion of competent authorities or Member States.

This exercise, run in parallel with the one conducted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) at a global level, presents aggregate data on capital ratios \u2013 risk-based and non-risk-based (leverage) \u2013 and liquidity ratios \u2013 the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) \u2013 for banks across the European Union (EU). It summarises the results using data as of 31 December 2015. \t\u00a0 \tOverall, the results of this exercise show a further improvement of European banks' capital positions, with a total average Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 12.7% at end December 2015 assuming full implementation of the CRD IV/CRR. The banks in the sample largely respect the future regulatory capital requirements, with only a very small number of institutions showing potential capital shortfalls. The shortfall amount to meet the full-implementation minimum CET1 requirement (7%) has been continuously shrinking since mid-2011, and was at its lowest level (EUR 0.4 billion) at end December 2015.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe analysis of the leverage ratio shows that there has been a continuous increase in the last periods. A significant number of institutions in the sample would be constrained by the minimum leverage ratio requirement (3%) rather than by risk based standards.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe LCR analysis is based on data in accordance with the Commission's Delegated Regulation. The average LCR is at 133.7% at end December 2015, and 91% of the banks in the sample show an LCR above the full implementation minimum requirement applicable since January 2018 (100%). In addition, time-series analyses show that the weighted average LCR has increased since June 2011, mainly due an increase in banks' liquidity buffers. \t\u00a0 \tIn absence of a finalised EU definition, the report monitors the NSFR compliance with the current Basel III standards. The analysis shows an overall average ratio of 107.0% with an overall shortfall in stable funding of EUR 240.1 billion. \tAround 79% of participating banks already meet the minimum NSFR requirement of 100%. Compared with previous periods, there has been a continuous increase in banks' NSFR, which is mainly driven by the increasing amount of available stable funding (ASF) for both groups. \t\u00a0 \tNote to the editors\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \t1. The exercise monitors the impact of the transposition of the CRD IV-CRR/Basel III requirements on EU banks. In particular, it monitors the impact of fully implementing the European Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV / CRR) on banks' capital ratios (risk-based and non-risk-based) and on their LCR, as well as the impact of fully implementing the Basel III framework on banks' NSFR. \t\u00a0 \t2. The results of the report are separately shown for small, medium-sized and large Group 2 banks, as well as Group 1 banks. Group 1 banks are banks with Tier 1 capital in excess of EUR 3 billion and internationally active. All other banks are categorised as Group 2 banks. Group 2 banks are classified into sub-samples: large Group 2 banks which have Tier 1 capital in excess of EUR 3 billion, medium-sized banks with Tier 1 capital below or equal to EUR 3 billion and above EUR 1.5 billion, and small banks having Tier 1 capital below or equal to EUR 1.5 billion.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \t3.

The Report is in response to a request from the European Commission to explore the possibilities of the core stable funding ratio (CFR) as a potential alternative metrics for the assessment of EU banks' funding risk, taking into account proportionality. The Report concludes that, overall, it would be misleading to rely only on the CFR to assess banks' funding needs because, unlike the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), the CFR does not look at the whole balance sheet of a bank and, therefore, cannot fully assess a potential funding gap. This Report is based on the same QIS data used for the NSFR Report published in December 2015. \t\u00a0 \tThe report shows a lack of correlation in terms of outcome and conclusions between the NSFR and the CFR for the whole sample of EU banks and particularly for the smaller ones. This is mainly due to the fact that CFR assesses the funding risk only considering the liabilities side of banks irrespective of the stable funding needed by the various types of assets they may have. The NSFR, on the contrary, provides a full funding risk assessment considering both sides of the balance sheet. \t\u00a0 \tFor this reason, the EBA believes that the CFR cannot replace the NSFR, which appears to be the most accurate metrics for assessing banks' funding risk. \tThis Report is based on the same QIS data used for NSFR Report published in December 2015, comprising 279 banks.

These risks have persisted for some time and can be related to lasting effects of the 2007 financial crisis. However, the EU financial system is also vulnerable to more immediate risks such as the result of the UK referendum on EU membership which has added political and legal uncertainties to those already affecting the financial system.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tGabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA and the current Chair of the Joint Committee, said: \t\u00a0 \"The Joint Committee proactively considers key risks to financial stability and assesses risk mitigation policies in cooperation with national and European institutions. We are considering the possibilities for further enhancing monitoring of financial industries, reinforcing adequate capital or risk buffers as well as ensuring adequate resolution arrangements for affected sectors.\u00a0 The Joint Committee is committed to providing a strong and streamlined supervisory response both on a micro- and macro prudential level, which is required by the challenging economic environment.\" \u00a0 \tLow growth and low yield environment \tLow growth and low yields affect the financial services industry through various channels. Interest rates and growth expectations have decreased further and are posing new challenges to the entire financial sector. Low interest margins significantly constrain banks' profitability, while life insurers' and pension funds' liabilities increase as it becomes more difficult to generate high investment returns. This environment may lead banks, insurers, pension funds and other investors to engage in risky search-for-yield behaviour, adding to already elevated risks around asset valuation and adjacent concerns about market liquidity.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe Joint Committee considers it essential to further develop effective recovery and resolution schemes in all relevant sectors, to employ adequate stress testing procedures and to enhance the monitoring of relevant risk drivers. \tProfitability of financial institutions \tLow quality of assets in many countries, conduct costs and growing competition from non-bank and non-insurance financial institutions negatively affect the profitability of banks and insurers. Subdued returns, further lowered by fees and charges, reduce the attractiveness of investment funds. While the EU-wide bank stress test results have demonstrated the importance of a better capitalised banking system, the high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) exacerbate concerns about medium-terms sustainability. Addressing NPLs as a major driver of uncertainties in the financial system has become a key challenge, and further NPL resolution requires comprehensive and proactive action among all relevant stakeholders. Following the UK referendum, profitability risks may be further intensified. Expectations of weaker macroeconomic conditions are amplified by growing political risks within the EU and globally. In addition, traditional financial service providers are facing increasing competition from Fintech providers which will further challenge the sustainability of their business models.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tResponding to this risk, supervisors need to encourage steps to adjust business models in search for sustainable income, to address excess capacities as well as to monitor and assess the impact of emerging innovative technologies and market practices.\u00a0 \tInterconnectedness within the financial system \tThe interconnectedness between the financial sector outside of the banking, insurance and pension fund industries with the wider financial system is increasing, as cross-sectoral exposures, asset price commonalities and the interdependency of business processes augment. \tThe Joint Committee considers that related stability risks should be assessed thoroughly to mitigate the increasing risk exposure outside the traditional financial system.\u00a0 \tNotes for Editors \tThe Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1 January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \t\u00a0 \tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering.

The analysis suggests that the potential impact of introducing a LR requirement of 3% on the provision of financing by credit institutions would be relatively moderate, while, overall, it should lead to more stable credit institutions. The report will inform the work of the European Commission on potential legislative proposals on LR. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA report recommends the introduction of a minimum LR requirement in the EU to mitigate the risk of excessive leverage, which is in line with the discussions held by the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) in January 2016.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe results of the quantitative analyses performed suggest that a 3% level of calibration for the LR is generally consistent with the objective of a backstop measure which supplements risk-based capital requirements. At the same time, the results of a simulation-based analysis estimating the impact of potential adjustment actions firms that do not meet the leverage ratio might take, suggest a high sensitivity to changes in the calibration of the LR and estimate that the potential reduction of exposures would increase significantly beyond a LR level of 3.5%.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe potential impact of introducing a LR requirement of 3% on the provision of financing by credit institutions would be relatively moderate. Similarly, on the basis of econometric analysis, it has been estimated that risk taking should not be strongly affected. The introduction of a 3% LR should lead to more stable credit institutions overall and the combined application of a risk-based ratio and a LR requirement will reduce the overall cyclicality of capital requirements. \t\u00a0 \tFurthermore, considering possible differentiation of the LR by business models, size or systemic relevance, the EBA has assessed the exposure of different categories of credit institutions to the risk of excessive leverage (REL) by means of a quantitative benchmarking, complemented by a qualitative judgment. Overall, the results do not give a strong indication of differences in the degree of exposure to REL across different types of credit institutions. However, global systemically important institutions (GSIIs) show a higher exposure to REL and therefore a higher LR requirement may be warranted. \t\u00a0 \tThe report also flags that while the Basel LR standard is fitting well with the EU banking sector, the specificities of certain business models already covered by other EU prudential regulations should be taken into account. This is particularly the case for Central Counterparties (CCPs) and Central Securities Depositaries (CSDs), which the EBA recommends be exempted. More broadly, the report describes the characteristics of various specialised business models, such as public development banks, and concludes that there is little room for differentiating the LR without opening at the same time the door to a potential circumvention of the basic principles of the LR. \u00a0\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA report did not find arguments to exempt certain credit institutions from being subject to compliance with a 3% LR minimum requirement on the basis of their limited size.

This is 200 bps higher than the sample in 2014 and 400 bps higher than in 2011.\u00a0 The hypothetical scenario leads to a stressed impact of 380 bps on the CET1 capital ratio, bringing it across the sample to 9.4% at the end of 2018.\u00a0 The CET1 fully loaded ratio falls from 12.6% to 9.2%, while the aggregate leverage ratio decreases from 5.2% to 4.2% in the adverse scenario. \tThe impact is driven by: \t\tcredit risk losses of \u20ac-349 bn contributing -370 bps to the impact on the CET1 capital ratio. \t\toperational risk (\u20ac-105 bn or -110 bps) of which conduct risk losses contributed -\u20ac71 bn or -80 bps to the CET1 impact \t\tmarket risk across all portfolios including CCR (\u20ac-98bn or -100bps). \tThe impact is partially offset by pre provision income flows, although these too are subject to stress factors and constraints in the methodology. For instance net interest income falls 20% in the adverse scenario from 2015 levels. \tThe 2016 EU-wide stress test does not contain a pass fail threshold. Instead it is designed to support ongoing supervisory efforts to maintain the process of repair of the EU banking sector.\u00a0 \tThe stress test will therefore be an important input into the supervisory review process in 2016. \tAs the stress test has a range of constraints designed to ensure comparability and consistency, supervisors will assess mitigating management actions before deciding on the appropriate supervisory action, of which a wide range may be employed. The focus in 2016 will, however, be on setting Pillar 2 Guidance to banks to maintain capital that can support the process of repair and lending into the real economy. Although pillar 2 Guidance is not a legal minimum, and does not impact the threshold for the Maximum Distributable Amount, banks are expected to follow guidance in normal circumstances. \tActing as a central data hub for the entire EU, the EBA is publishing both aggregate results of the EU-wide exercise and granular data for each bank, including detailed information at both the starting and end point of the exercise, under the baseline and the adverse scenarios. \tNotes for editors \tThe 2016 EU-wide stress test is coordinated by the EBA and is carried out in cooperation with the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the European Commission, and the competent authorities from all relevant national jurisdictions.

The appropriateness of the basis for the target level is assessed on the basis of a number of qualitative criteria and historical data. The draft report recommends changing the basis from covered deposits to a total liabilities based measure. The consultation will run until 2 September 2016. \t\u00a0 \tThe Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) requires the EBA to submit to the European Commission a report with recommendations on the appropriate reference point for setting the target level for resolution financing arrangements, and in particular, whether \u2018total liabilities' constitute a more appropriate basis than \u2018covered deposits'. \t\u00a0 \tBased on preliminary analysis and results, the EBA recommends in its report to change the base for the target level of the resolution financing arrangements to one of the options: \u2018total liabilities (excluding own funds) less covered deposits' or \u2018total liabilities (including own funds)' or \u2018total liabilities (excluding own funds).

In the case of total liabilities (excluding own funds) less covered deposits, the target level basis should accurately reflect the potential call on the resolution financing arrangements in case of a given failure. \t\u00a0 \tThe BRRD requires Member States to create industry funded resolution financing arrangements (informally called \u2018resolution funds'). The resolution financing arrangements can be used to support the orderly resolution of an institution under the rules of the BRRD, once losses have been absorbed by creditors and shareholders. The BRRD requires a certain minimum target level for the resolution financing arrangement to be funded from the ex-ante contributions within ten years, by 31 December 2024. Currently, the target level is defined as 1% of the covered deposits in the Member State concerned. The overall level of the resolution financing arrangement is assumed to be constant irrespective of a change to the basis for calculating the target level. Given this assumption, the report further recommends that if the European Commission proposes to change the target level basis, it should also consider an appropriate ratio depending on that target level basis. \tConsultation process \t\u200eComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

The analysis is based on supervisory data on non-performing loans (NPLs) and forbearance (FBL) for over 160 EU banks. The report shows that despite improvements NPLs remain high, with associated implications for the economy and bank's profitability. The report identifies various structural impediments to addressing NPLs and sets out three key areas for improvement.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe EU banking sector has seen significant capital strengthening since 2011, which is a pre-condition for addressing the quality of banks' balance sheets. Asset quality reviews carried out since 2014 have contributed to identification, and some reduction, of NPL ratios but the overall level of legacy assets remains high, albeit uneven across countries. \t\u00a0 \tWith an average ratio at 5.7% in March 2016 \u2013 NPLs in the EU remain up to three times higher than other global jurisdictions. The EBA found that while the definitions of non-performing assets and provisioning rules are now mostly aligned across the EU, there still are very significant differences in some of the key structural areas that affect banks' capacity to deal with NPLs. \t\u00a0 \tStructural impediments include legal systems, the duration of court proceedings and tax regimes, which the EBA found to vary significantly across the EU, as well as the absence of a deep and liquid secondary market in NPLs. According to the report, the major impediment to reliable and fast insolvency procedures is the slow process and significant work-overload of some judicial systems, especially those with high NPL ratios. The link between the expected duration of insolvency proceedings and coverage ratios seems to confirm that provisions strongly depend on collateral posted, recovery rates and the speed of the recovery process. Out of court restructuring of debt under judicial supervision could be an alternative path for many insolvent clients, but it is not frequently used. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA's report also identifies some policy options for removing or easing the impediments to NPLs resolution. \t\u00a0 \t\tThe first area is to support the ongoing supervisory work to push for improved provisioning and arrears management.\u00a0 \t\tThe second area is to address structural issues, such as backlogs in judicial systems and processes. Since the length of recovery procedures has an inverse relationship with the ask-bid spread, improvements in judicial process and use of out-of-court restructuring could help to improve the marketability of NPLs.\u00a0 \t\tA third area relates to the liquidity, transparency and efficiency of secondary market in loans to facilitate the disposal of NPLs. Enhanced transparency regarding the state of NPLs and real estate collateral valuation would contribute to a better understanding and pricing of the risks and, ultimately, facilitate the sale process and lead to lower discounts in secondary market transactions. The establishment of asset management companies (AMCs) \u2013 with or without public support \u2013 can also play a key role in resolving NPLs and is a key factor in price discovery. The EBA concludes that the revival of the EU market for debt securitisation may be a way of widening the range of options that banks could consider for dealing with their NPLs, but stressed the need for supervisory guidance in tackling NPLs, particularly in collateral valuation and arrears management.

Each chapter starts with a brief description of the assessment criteria to be used by competent authorities as regards verification requests and of the methods to be used by competent authorities in this context.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tAmong others, clarifications are provided on the independence of validation function from the credit risk control unit, on the calculation of own-LGD estimates as default-weighted averages and on the process of calculation of the difference between expected loss amounts and credit risk adjustments. \t\u00a0 \tEBA's studies on the comparability of risk weighted exposure amounts (RWAs) have shown that different supervisory practices can contribute significantly to non-risk-based differences in capital requirements when calculated according to the IRB Approach. \t\u00a0 \tThe draft RTS published today are part of the EBA's work on supervisory convergence, which is key for ensuring comparability of models' outcomes and restoring public confidence in the use of such models for regulatory purposes. These final draft RTS are considered an integral part of the EBA's Plan of a regulatory review of the IRB Approach. \t\u00a0 \tLegal background and next steps \tUnder the IRB Approach institutions determine their own funds requirements for credit risk taking into account own estimates of risk parameters. Competent Authorities may, according to Article 143(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation \u2013 CRR), permit institutions to use the Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRB Approach), provided that the conditions set out in Chapter 3, Title II, Part three of the CRR are met. \t\u00a0 \tThe mandate for the EBA to develop such RTS is laid down in Article 144(2) CRR.

The interim report is addressed to the European Commission, and it will inform a future legislative proposal on the implementation of the Financial Stability Board's \"total loss-absorbing capacity\" (TLAC) standard in the EU and the review of MREL. Further elements will be covered in the EBA's final report which will be provided to the European Commission by 31 October 2016. \t\u00a0 \tThe interim report contains a number of provisional recommendations, in particular: \t\u00a0 \t\tchanging the reference base of the MREL requirement from total liabilities and own funds to risk-weighted assets with, in time, a leverage exposure backstop; \t\tpreventing CET1 instruments from counting both towards capital buffers and MREL, while considering the implications on \"maximum distributable amounts\" (MDA) triggers; \t\textending and enhancing the existing powers available to address breaches of MREL; \t\tin calibrating MREL, specific business models may be worth considering to the extent that they lead to differences in resolution strategies. Calibration should in all cases be closely linked to and justified by the institution-specific resolution strategy; \t\tintroducing mandatory subordination for at least some banks, while more generally enhancing transparency and disclosure for all creditors on the creditor hierarchy; and \t\tstreamlining the requirement to include international recognition clauses in contracts giving rise to \"bail-inable\" liabilities. \tPreliminary quantitative findings on the financing capacity and needs of EU banking groups are also available in the interim report. These findings are however subject to several methodological caveats and should be read in their context. In the absence of MREL decisions for institutions to date, and given the limited information related to the resolution authorities' MREL policy approach, the EBA was required to make assumptions on the likely scope and calibration of MREL. These assumptions are by definition different from the actual levels of MREL which will ultimately be determined by resolution authorities in relation to each institution and group. \t\tLegal background and next steps \t\tThis interim report has been drafted in accordance with Articles 45(19) and (20) of the BRRD, which mandate the EBA to deliver a report on the implementation of MREL to the European Commission by 31 October 2016. The report must cover a number of areas, including proposals on appropriate adjustments to the parameters of the minimum requirement, and consistency with international standards. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tThe European Commission has committed to bringing forward a combined legislative proposal implementing the FSB's TLAC standard in the European Union and reviewing MREL, by the end of 2016. In order to provide timely input into the European Commission's deliberations and to gather input from other stakeholders, the EBA has issued this interim report ahead of the mandated final report. The interim report does not cover all of the items in the BRRD mandate for the MREL report; additional elements will be covered in the final report. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tStakeholders are invited to send their answers to the questions included in the interim report to mrelreport@eba.europa.eu, by Tuesday 30 August 2016. \t\tNotes to editors \t\t\u200eMREL is an essential complement to the bail-in mechanism, as laid down by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (the BRRD). Bail-in ensures that the costs of a bank's failure are borne, first and foremost, by shareholders and creditors rather than taxpayers. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tMREL consists of own funds and debt with certain qualities that would be written down and converted into equity when required. This requirement is to be set for each bank by the relevant resolution authorities, in line with the BRRD and regulatory standards which have been developed by the EBA in 2015 and recently endorsed by the European Commission. MREL ensures that sufficient capital and debt instruments are available to absorb the losses of a failing institution and to recapitalise its critical functions. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tBail-in became applicable in all EU Member States as of 1 January 2016 and resolution authorities are working to progressively set MREL as part of the ongoing resolution planning process. \t\t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-consults-public-on-the-minimum-requirement-for-own-funds-and-eligible-liabilities-mrel-"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0834", "date": "2016-07-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA announces timing for publication of 2016 EU-wide stress test results", "text": " The EBA announced today that detailed individual results for the banks participating in the 2016 EU-wide stress test, along with detailed balance sheets and exposure data as of end 2015, will be published on Friday 29 July 2016 at 22:00 Central European Summer Time (21:00 British Summer Time).

The Report, which is addressed to the EU Parliament and the Council, reviews consistency in the application of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) and supervisory practices in the assessment of recovery plans. The EBA's work in supervisory convergence is designed to foster comparable approaches and consistent outcomes in applying the Single Rulebook. This is necessary for a level playing field, effective supervision of cross border groups, and to identify supervisory best practices.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe Report highlights that supervisory authorities across the EU have made additional progress on convergence of supervisory practices, also thanks to the implementation of the EBA SREP Guidelines for the 2016 SREP cycle. In particular, the EBA notes the consistent structure of various SREPs and clear articulation of additional capital requirements, mirroring the composition of minimum own funds requirements. \t\u00a0 \tHowever, the report also identifies important differences, in particular in determining the amount of additional capital requirements and in the legal nature of such requirements. These, in combination with the application of automatic restrictions on distributions, risk different treatment of banks and investors in the Single Market. \t\u00a0 \tCommon rules are vital for the effective functioning of the Single Market and consistency in supervisory risk assessments and outcomes play an important role in supporting the Single Rulebook, whilst maintaining the space for proportionality and supervisory judgement that is required for effective supervision. \t\u00a0 \tNotes to editors \t\u00a0 \tOne of the EBA's key mandates is to develop ensure supervisory convergence and consistency of supervisory outcomes within the EU. In addition, Article 107 of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRDIV) includes a specific mandate for the EBA on consistency of supervisory reviews, evaluations and supervisory measures in Member States. This Article also requires the EBA to report to the EU Parliament and the Council on the degree of convergence of supervisory practices. \t\u00a0 \tBased on this mandate, the EBA has collected information and analysed relevant supervisory practices. It has also developed a number of Guidelines and Technical Standards and contributed to the promotion of convergence in supervision through its participation in Colleges of Supervisors of cross-border institutions, the development of a European Supervisory Handbook, the provision of dedicated training, and the performance of analytical and benchmarking activities. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-notes-progress-in-convergence-of-supervisory-practices-across-the-eu"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0837", "date": "2016-07-11", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA updates on monitoring of Additional Tier 1 instruments", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a draft update of its report on the monitoring of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments last published on 29 May 2015 and proposed draft standardised templates for AT1 instruments.\u00a0 \tUpdate of the AT1 monitoring report\u00a0 \tThis second update of the report is based on the review of 33 AT1 issuances from EU institutions, which took place between August 2013 and December 2015, for a total amount of EUR 35.5 bn. \tCompared with the first update released in May 2015, this report includes new provisions on triggers, calls/ repurchases/redemptions, tax events and gross-up provisions and on conversion and write-down mechanisms. \tStandardised templates for AT1 issuances \tThe objective of these templates is to cover the prudential provisions of the AT1 issuances. They contain essential and optional provisions concerning in particular flexibility of payments, permanence, loss absorbency and are based on the most commonly observed loss absorption mechanisms. \tThese standardised templates are proposed to institutions on an opt-in basis, in case they are willing to use them The use of these templates would bring a certain level of security to the issuing institutions as the templates are perceived to reflect the expectations of the supervisory community on the practical implementation of the provisions laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and Q&As, based on the experience gained with the observations of issuances already made in the EU market. \tThe proposed templates are not legally binding and their use is optional.

In particular, the report highlights that the actual level of diversity in the composition of the management body in institutions differs significantly between Member States, namely regarding the gender diversity. The Authority calls on institutions and Member States to consider additional measures for promoting a more balanced representation of both genders. The report is based on data from 873 institutions from 29 EU and EEA Member States, and covers credit institutions of different sizes as well as investment firms. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA report on the benchmarking of diversity practices showed that the representation of women within the management body is still very low, with 13.6% in the management function and 18.9% in the supervisory function.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tAccording to EU legislation, all institutions are required to adopt a policy promoting diversity within their management bodies, as a way to improve decisions on strategies and risks, and mainstream a broader range of views, experience, values and background. Significant institutions are also required to set a target for the representation of the underrepresented gender in the management body and to take measures to increase their number in the management body to meet that target.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn spite of the requirements introduced by the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV), only a limited number of institutions (35.5%) have already adopted a diversity policy and only around two thirds of them have already one that promotes gender diversity.

The EBA report found diversity of age only to be of concern for a limited number of institutions, while the geographical provenance was an issue only for some large international banks. Finally, diversity with regard to education and professional background is linked to the management bodies collective fit and properness, and was found to be well developed in many institutions.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA will continue to monitor the development of diversity in management bodies and issue periodical benchmarking reports.

Together with the Risk Dashboard, the EBA published, for the first time, the results of a Risk Assessment Questionnaire, which it conducted with banks and market analysts in April and May this year. \t\u00a0 \tIncreased market volatility following the results of the UK referendum indicates a significantly heightened risk outlook of EU banks. \t\u00a0 \tThe Risk Dashboard shows that in Q1 2016, EU banks' CET1 ratios remained at comfortable levels, albeit declining modestly from 13.6% to 13.4%. This was driven by a decline in capital that was not offset by a decrease in risk weighted assets and is mainly due to the gradual transition to the full implementation of the provisions on capital laid down in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), as well as the reduction of retained earnings. \t\u00a0 \tThe ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) stood at 5.7%, and although is 10bps below year end 2015, thus suggesting supervisory efforts are bearing fruit, remains too high. Looking forward, banks and market analysts assume a deterioration in asset quality mainly for asset finance, according to the results of the Risk Assessment Questionnaire. The results also show, that more than half of the banks plan to increase their volumes of corporate and SME financing portfolios as well as residential mortgage and consumer loans.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tProfitability remained squeezed and the annualised return on equity (RoE) decreased to 5.8%, 1.1 percentage points (p.p.) below the first quarter last year - although it increased by 1.1 p.p. if compared to end-2015 data. The RoE was still significantly below banks' Cost of Equity (CoE), which is estimated between 8% and 10% by more than half of the institutions in the Risk Assessment Questionnaire. \t\u00a0 \tIn contrast to the three former quarters, the loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 121.6% from 121.2% in the former quarter. The asset encumbrance ratio decreased to 25.4% against 25.6% at the end of 2015.

The consultation runs until 29 September 2016. \tThe revised Pillar 3 framework, which applies as of 31 December 2016, provides for common format and harmonised frequencies for the disclosure of existing requirements as well as adds certain new requirements. \tThe incorporation of the revised Pillar 3 into the CRR would requires an update of the disclosure requirements laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), which will only take place as part of a comprehensive review process of the regulation. In the meantime, EU banks will face market pressure to provide disclosures in line with the revised Pillar 3 when it becomes applicable. \tThe aim of these Guidelines is, therefore, to provide guidance to institutions to enable them to comply with the CRR provisions while implementing the revised Basel Pillar 3 requirements. The Guidelines apply to Globally and Other Systemically Important Institutions (G-SII and O-SII) and do not waive the requirements for these and other institutions to comply with the other CRR disclosure requirements for which the Guidelines offer no guidance. \tThe Guidelines will apply for the year-end 2017 disclosures. However, G-SII are recommended to implement a limited subset of disclosures relating to risk-weighted assets (RWA) and capital requirements as soon as year-end 2016 so as to provide users with information suitable for comparison with international peers.

The report covers all the products that fall under the EBA's consumer protection mandate, such as mortgages, personal loans, deposits, payment accounts, payment services and electronic money.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tFor the 2016 Consumer Trends Report, the EBA used a wide range of different information sources and eight different consumer trends and related issues have emerged as relevant. Some of these had already been highlighted in last year's report, namely: household indebtedness, with a focus on lending and related practices, household borrowing and arrears handling, and creditworthiness assessment; banking fees and costs, looking at fees and charges on payment accounts, and their comparability, and at selected costs related to loans; selling practices related to the banking products, with issues related to cross-selling and sales incentives; innovations in payments; alternative financial services providers; and finally innovative uses of consumer data. The two new trends identified in this year's edition refer to foreign currency loans, especially mortgages; and to virtual currencies.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA has already started to address some of these trends, and will use the findings of the report as input when developing and publishing its work programme for 2017 later in the year. \tIn the final chapter, the report summarises how the EBA addressed the issues identified in last year's report. The measures taken include three sets of final Guidelines on creditworthiness assessments, on arrears and foreclosure, and on product oversight and governance, draft Guidelines on remuneration policies and practices for sales staff, as well as a Discussion Paper on the innovative uses of consumer data. \tBackground and legal basis \tThe annual Consumer Trends Report is the fulfilment of the mandate conferred on the EBA in Article 9 of its founding Regulation, which requires the Authority to take a leading role in promoting transparency, simplicity and fairness in the market for consumer financial products or services across the internal market, including by collecting, analysing and reporting on consumer trends. \tThe EBA made use of a number of different sources for data and information when identifying the trends for 2016. These include the national supervisory authorities across the 28 EU Member States, the EBA Banking Stakeholder Group (BSG), national Ombudsmen across the European Economic Area, via the Financial Dispute Resolution Network (FIN-NET), as well as statistical datasets and reports produced by independent research institutes and other organisations. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-its-consumer-trends-report-2016"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0848", "date": "2016-06-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA publishes its 2015 Annual Report", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) publishes today its 2015 Annual Report, which provides a detailed account of all the work the Authority achieved in the past year and anticipates the key areas of focus in the coming years. \t\u00a0 \tIn 2015, the EBA completed the bulk of the G20 package, thus strengthening the Single Rulebook applicable to the EU banking sector.

These final draft RTS will be part of the Single Rulebook aimed at enhancing regulatory harmonisation in the banking sector in Europe. \tSpecialised lending is a type of exposure towards an entity specifically created to finance or operate physical assets, where the primary source of income and repayment of the obligation lies directly with the assets being financed. \t\u00a0 \tThese final draft RTS define four classes of specialised lending: project finance, real estate, object finance, and commodities finance and for each of these four classes, a set of assessment criteria is specified by means of a list of factors that institutions shall take into account.

Institutions shall apply the approach set out in these draft RTS to combine the assignments of the factors to the categories in order to determine the final category and the risk weight to be attributed to the specialised lending exposure. This approach requires institutions to calculate the weighted average of the assignments of the factors to the categories, where institutions should determine the weights they assign to each factor, under certain strict conditions. The approach followed in these RTS is in line with the current Basel framework, which uses the so-called \u2018supervisory slotting criteria' approach under which specialised lending exposures are classified into categories depending on the underlying credit risk.

Institutions may obtain continuous insight into purchasing habits and preferences, as consumers engage in payment transactions through their accounts or cards. The work of the EBA focuses on the use of consumer data in the banking sector, including retail payments. \t\u00a0 \tAccording to the Discussion Paper, potential benefits to consumers include cost reductions and improved product quality, while financial institutions can benefit from new sources of revenue and reductions in costs. The EBA also flagged risks for consumers, mostly in the form of information asymmetries, and data misuse and security. This in particular is the case when data usage is not properly described or updated in the contractual documentation provided by financial institutions, or when consumers may simply not understand the information on how their data may be used. \t\u00a0 \tRisks to financial institutions are also identified in the paper. The questionable use of consumer data may expose institutions to reputational risks, while competitive distortions may emerge, as institutions which are not in a position to process consumer data may not be able to compete with new market entrants specialised in using consumer data.

The amendment follows the European Commission's request to amend the draft RTS using the specifications provided by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA has amended the draft RTS on additional collateral outflows to include the BCBS's HLBA approach which had been clarified by way of a Frequently Asked Question in April 2014. The BCBS approach focuses on the largest net difference in collateral posted instead of the largest gross difference. The Commission's assessment of the draft RTS was delayed pending its adoption of a Delegated Act on the liquidity coverage ratio of October 2014. In December 2015, the Commission raised concerns that the EBA's HLBA approach could have a significant impact on credit institutions and international derivative markets and, therefore, decided not to adopt the draft RTS as it had been submitted by the EBA, but signalled its willingness to endorse an amended version based on the BCBS's HLBA approach. \tBackground and legal basis \tThe draft RTS on additional collateral outflows were developed in accordance with Article 423(3) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and submitted to the Commission for endorsement on 27 March 2014. They define the additional collateral outflows corresponding to collateral needs which would result from the impact of an adverse scenario on an institution's derivatives transactions. \t\u00a0 \tOn 3 December 2015, the Commission informed the EBA of its intention not to endorse the draft RTS by acting in accordance with the sixth subparagraph of Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-amends-historical-look-back-approach-hlba-method-for-calculating-additional-collateral-outflows"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0865", "date": "2016-04-25", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA consults on disclosure of encumbered and unencumbered assets", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a consultation on draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the disclosure of encumbered and unencumbered assets for the provision of transparent and harmonised information on the topic, as laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).

O-SIIs are those institutions which are deemed systemically relevant in addition to Global Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs), already identified(1). The institutions have been identified by relevant authorities across the Union according to harmonised criteria provided by the EBA(2). This list reflects also the additional capital buffers that the relevant authorities have set for the O-SIIs they have identified. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA disclosed today the first list of all the O-SIIs in the EU, which have been identified on the basis of uniform criteria for the first time. Relevant authorities across the EU jurisdictions have drawn up the list on the basis of the criteria provided by the EBA Guidelines, which define the size, importance (substitutability or financial system infrastructure), complexity (or cross-border activities) and interconnectedness of such institutions. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA Guidelines provide additional flexibility for relevant authorities to apply their supervisory judgment, when deciding to include other institutions, which might have not been automatically identified as O-SIIs. This approach allows for the assessment of all financial systems across the EU in a comparable way, whilst still not excluding those institutions which may be relevant on the basis of specific peculiarities of one EU jurisdiction. The EBA acts as the single point of disclosure for the list of O-SIIs across the EU, while each relevant authority discloses this information for its respective jurisdiction, along with further details on their rationale and identification process. This additional information is key for understanding the specific features of each O-SII and how they have been identified in terms of supervisory judgment, optional indicators used, buffer decisions and phase-in implementation dates. \t\u00a0 \tThe identification of institutions as O-SIIs in the EU is based on 2015 data and going forward, updated lists of O-SIIs will be disclosed on an annual basis, along with the definition of any CET1 capital buffer requirements which may need to be set.

In most cases, money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks - including those associated with weaker forms of customer identification- can be managed effectively by offering a more limited range of services or setting up stricter internal controls, which will facilitate early intervention in the event of suspicion. \t\u00a0 \tThe scale of the current migrant movement to the EU, the level of ML/TF risk associated with the countries or territories of origin of some asylum seekers, as well as concerns over the reliability and robustness of some asylum seekers' identity documentation, create unique challenges for Member States and their credit and financial institutions. At the same time, access to basic financial products and services is not only a pre-requisite for participating fully in economic and social life, it is also central to the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Lack of access to financial products can drive financial transactions underground, making the detection and reporting of suspicious transactions more difficult. \t\u00a0 \tThe Opinion was issued following a request by the EBA Banking Stakeholders Group (BSG) and is addressed to EU Competent Authorities.\u00a0 \tLegal basis \tThis Opinion was issued in accordance with Article 29(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, \u00a0which mandates the EBA to \u00a0provide opinions to Competent Authorities in order to foster a common supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices in areas of its competence, which include AML/CFT. \t\u00a0 \tThe Opinion considers the application of Union AML law as well as the relationship between Directive 2005/60/EC and Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the one hand, and Directive 2014/92/EU on the other hand.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-opinion-on-the-application-of-customer-due-diligence-measures-to-customers-who-are-asylum-seekers-from-higher-risk-third-countries-or-te"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0872", "date": "2016-04-12", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes Report and recommends supervisory best practices on securitisation risk retention, due diligence and disclosure", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a Report analysing measures taken by Competent Authorities in 2014 to ensure compliance by institutions with securitisation risk retention, due diligence and disclosure requirements. Based on the EBA findings, the EBA has identified best practices, which will help Competent Authorities in their supervisory assessments of compliance of these requirements. \t\u00a0 \tThe Report highlights that institutions are generally undertaking appropriate actions to comply with such requirements, and only a very limited number of non-compliant institutions have been reported since EU rules were introduced in 2011. In total, 10 cases of non-compliance with risk retention and due diligence have been reported. Sanctions in the form of additional risk weights as per Article 407 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) were applied in one out of the 10 cases.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tAccording to the EBA analysis, it also appears that ensuring compliance with risk retention, due diligence and disclosure requirements has a lower priority in the supervisory processes of Competent Authorities, although this may be partially justified in light of the expectations on the development of a the new securitisation framework at EU level. \t\u00a0 \tBased on the findings of the analysis, the EBA has identified a number of general supervisory best practices to guide Competent Authorities in their supervisory assessments of compliance with the risk retention, due diligence and disclosure requirements in their jurisdictions.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe report also assesses how the EBA recommendations on enhancing regulation of risk retention, due diligence and disclosure rules, as specified in the EBA Opinion of December 2014, have been taken on board in the proposals of the new securitisation framework issued by the Commission in September 2015.

A proactive stance to address still high stocks of non-performing loans at banks in some regions is also needed. \t\tIncreasing interconnectedness of bank and non-bank entities. \t\tOver the last five years the role of non-bank and non-insurance financial institutions has increased. The interconnectedness between different entities represents a potential channel for the propagation of shocks. \t\tThe Joint Committee believes that this risk should be tackled through enhanced supervisory monitoring of concentration risks, cross border exposures and regulatory arbitrage. \t\tPotential contagion from China and other emerging markets. \t\tAfter a decade of positive contribution to the global economic growth, economic activity in China and other emerging markets has started to recede. \t\tThe Joint Committee calls on national supervisors to include emerging market risk in sensitivity analyses or stress tests and to scrutinise optimistic assumptions of financial institutions with regard to emerging market exposure and returns from emerging market business. \t\u00a0 \tGabriel Bernardino, Chairman of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the current Chairman of the Joint Committee, said: \t\"The financial service industry struggles to offer adequate level of profitability and increasingly turns to a search-for-yield behaviour.

The Report suggests a number of measures that will help supervisors addressing the identified risks in a consistent way. \u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe Joint Committee is fully committed to continue promoting supervisory convergence to further eliminate supervisory arbitrage and improve the stability and confidence in the EU financial system.

Against this backdrop, policy recommendations 7 and 8 of the CVA report concluded that the RTS should be amended to address the difficulties associated with the determination of proxy spreads for large numbers of counterparties, for which spreads may never be observed on markets, as well as issues linked with LGDMKT. \t\u00a0 \tTherefore, the present amending RTS propose limited amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) No 526/2014 that aim at further specifying cases where alternative approaches can be used for the purposes of identifying an appropriate proxy spread and LGDMKT. The proposed amendments are expected to lead to a more adequate calculation of own funds requirements for CVA risk, including in some cases a reduction of own funds requirements for CVA risk, thus partially remedying the over-estimation of current own funds requirements for counterparties in the scope of the CVA risk charge in the EU.\u00a0 \tConsultation process \tResponses to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

The update shows a further increase in EU banks' capital ratios. Profitability remains low and NPL ratios are still high. \t\u00a0 \tBanks' ratio of common equity tier 1 (CET1) rose further by 60bps to 13.6% in Q4 2015, driven by an increase of capital and a decline of RWAs (ratios are weighted average). The ratio of non-performing loans (NPL) was 5.8%, 10bps below Q3 2015. Notwithstanding the improvement, credit quality and the level of legacy assets remain a concern. The coverage ratio for NPLs improved by 10bps to 43.8% in Q4 2015 (compared to the former quarter). Dispersion is still wide among countries (between 30% and over 65%), but narrowed among banks of different size class (between 42% and 45%). \t\u00a0 \tThe average return on equity (RoE) was 4.7% in Q4 2015, 1.7 percentage points lower than in Q3 2015, but higher than 2014 level (3.5%).

The report, which is part of the regular activities of the Authority, focuses on the identification of staff, the application of deferral arrangements, the pay-out in instruments and the impact of the bonus cap on institutions financial stability and cost flexibility, which was found to have no significant effect. The report differentiates between data on the remuneration of \"high-earners\" and benchmarking data for \"identified staff\". \t\u00a0 \tThe number of high-earners in the EU increased significantly, from 3 178 in 2013 to 3 865 in 2014, corresponding to a 21.6% increase on the previous year. The percentage of those high-earners who are identified staff, i.e. those who have a potential impact on institutions' risk profiles, also increased significantly from 59% in 2013 to 87% in 2014; and the absolute number of identified staff went up from 34 060 in 2013 to 62 787 in 2014. \t\u00a0 \tThis increase in numbers is mainly the result of the EBA's Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) on identified staff, which entered into force in 2014. These RTS brought a more accurate definition based on qualitative and quantitative criteria, so as to allow for a better identification of those staff that have a material impact on the risk profile of institutions. \t\u00a0 \tThe introduction of the so-called \u2018bonus cap' \u2013 the limitation of the ratio between the variable and the fixed components of remuneration to 100% (200% with shareholders' approval) which is applicable since 2014 \u2013 had an impact on remuneration practices; EU banking institutions shifted the remuneration for their identified staff towards the fixed component, bringing the ratio in line with what is prescribed by EU legislation. As a result, the average ratio between the variable and fixed salary paid to identified staff was 65.48% in 2014, down from 104.27% in 2013. At the same time, the average ratio between the variable and fixed remuneration paid to high earners dropped from 317% in 2013 to 127% in 2014. \t\u00a0 \tThe introduction of the bonus cap was found to have no significant effect on institutions' financial stability and cost flexibility. For most institutions, the fixed salary of identified staff accounted for less than 1% of their own funds; and on average accounted for only 3.12% of the institutions' administrative costs. This small increase in the fixed remuneration for identified staff is not material compared to the administrative costs of institutions. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA report also highlighted that institutions' remuneration practices were still not sufficiently harmonised across the EU. In particular, the application of deferral and pay-out in instruments varied significantly across Member States and institutions. This is due to differences in national implementation, which, in many cases, allow for waivers of these provisions when certain criteria are met. These differences have already been highlighted in the EBA's Opinion on the application of proportionality in the area of remuneration. \t\u00a0 \tThis report has been submitted to the European Commission as part of information provided to inform the review of remuneration provisions mandated in Article 161(2) CRD.

In addition, it will facilitate the supervisory process, allowing supervisors to identify and assess risks consistently across the EU and to compare EU banks in an effective manner. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-amends-dpm-and-xbrl-taxonomy-2-4-for-remittance-of-supervisory-reporting"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0893", "date": "2016-03-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA seeks comments on reporting of prudent valuation information", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on the inclusion of prudent valuation into COREP, the reporting framework through which EU banking institutions report supervisory information.

This exercise, run in parallel with the one conducted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) at a global level, allows the gathering of aggregate results on capital \u2013 risk-based and non-risk-based (leverage) ratios \u2013 and liquidity ratios \u2013 the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) \u2013 for banks in the European Union (EU). It summarises the results using data as of 30 June 2015. \t\u00a0 \tResults show a further improvement of European banks' capital positions, largely fulfilling the future regulatory capital requirements, with only a very small number of banks suffering from potential capital shortfalls. The shortfall amounts, as represented by the difference between the current and full-implementation level of capital, have been continuously shrinking since mid-2011, and are now at their lowest level (EUR 1 billion compared with a CET1 requirement of 7%) as at end June-15. \t\u00a0 \tFor the first time, the monitoring exercise analyses the leverage ratio, as defined in EU legislation, in conjunction with the risk-based capital ratio analysis. The analysis indicates that the leverage ratio is indeed a binding regulatory constraint for a significant number of institutions in the sample.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tWith regard to the LCR, the average ratio as of the end of June 2015 is 121.2% for Group 1 banks and 156.7% for Group 2 banks. \u00a0Four fifths of the participating banks exhibit an LCR ratio above 100%, while nine out ten banks have an LCR ratio above the 70% minimum requirement (which is the binding minimum of the EU LCR from January 2016). Furthermore, the analysis shows that there has been an increase in banks' LCR over time, which can be attributed to structural adjustments (both an increase in high quality liquid assets (HQLA) and a decrease of net outflows), as well as to the recalibration of the LCR framework as published in January 2013. \u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tWith respect to the NSFR, Group 1 and Group 2 banks show an average ratio of 104% and 111%, respectively, with an overall shortfall in stable funding of EUR 341 billion. Around three quarters of participating banks already meet the minimum NSFR requirement of 100%. Compared with previous periods, there has been a continuous increase in banks' NSFR, which is mainly driven by the increasing amount of available stable funding (ASF) for both groups. \tNote to editors\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \t\tThe exercise monitors the impact of the transposition of the CRD IV-CRR/Basel III requirements on EU banks. In particular, it monitors the impact of fully implementing the European Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV / CRR) on banks' capital ratios (risk-based and non-risk-based) and on their LCR, as well as the impact of fully implementing the Basel III framework on banks' NSFR. \t\tFor the first time, calculations of the LCR in this report are based on the European Commission delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61. \t\tThe results of the report are separately shown for small, medium-sized and large Group 2 banks, as well as for Global Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs) amongst Group 1 banks. Group 1 banks are banks with Tier 1 capital in excess of EUR 3 billion and internationally active. All other banks are categorised as Group 2 banks. Group 2 banks are classified into sub-samples: large Group 2 banks which have Tier 1 capital in excess of EUR 3 billion, medium-sized banks with Tier 1 capital below or equal to EUR 3 billion and above EUR 1.5 billion, and small banks having Tier 1 capital below or equal to EUR 1.5 billion.\u00a0 \t\tThe large number and high coverage of banks participating in this exercise allows for a high representativeness of the analysis and results. Overall, 21 EU Member States (MS) participated in this exercise, representing both Euro (16 MS) and non-Euro MS. \t\tA total of 297 banks submitted data for this exercise on a voluntary and confidential basis, covering various size categories of the European banking sector. 49 banks belong to Group 1 and 248 banks belong to Group 2, of which 35 are large, 40 medium-sized and 173 small Group 2 banks.\u00a0 \t\tThe results of this study are not comparable to industry estimates, as they do not include assumptions regarding banks' future profitability, changes in capital or balance sheet composition, nor further management actions that could be taken in response to the CRDIV-CRR / Basel III framework. \t\tThe results of previous exercises in this series were published semi-annually since April 2012. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-results-of-the-crdiv-crr-basel-iii-monitoring-exercise-as-of-30-june-2015"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0895", "date": "2016-03-01", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes its annual assessment of EU colleges of supervisors", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its annual assessment of EU colleges of supervisors, the forum within which joint decisions on capital and liquidity and recovery plans are organised for EU cross border banking groups. The report assesses how colleges have functioned during 2015 and identifies key activities for the effective oversight of EU cross border banking groups in 2016. In addition, it draws the attention of supervisors to some specific items for 2016, including non-performing loans (NPLs) and balance sheet cleaning, business model sustainability, conduct risk and IT risk. \t\u00a0 \tThe requirements of the 2015 EBA Colleges Action Plan, aiming to improve functioning of supervisory colleges across the EU, have been fulfilled to a reasonable extent.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tOverall the quality of group risk assessments, one of the key outcomes of colleges work, has further improved. Significant effort was observed in the frequency and quality of college meetings. However, the EBA also highlighted substantial drawbacks, namely in relation to some aspects of the joint decision processes, the quality of joint decision documents, and requests for individual recovery plans outside the joint decision process.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tAppropriate reasoning and articulation of capital requirements stressed in previous years' assessments still remained a challenge in 2015. In particular, areas where improvements are needed is the granularity of capital requirements by risk type as well as the lack of consistent articulation of additional capital requirements in joint decisions. \t\u00a0 \tThe formal joint decision process on the assessment of group recovery plans has been initiated for the vast majority of the monitored colleges. A substantial challenge faced by a number of supervisory colleges was the treatment of pre-existing individual recovery plans, or of requests from host authorities for individual plans for subsidiaries of cross-border banking groups, which were made outside the joint decision process established in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). \t\u00a0 \tThe report also sets specific items for supervisory attention in 2016 and identifies the need for supervisors to focus on ongoing balance sheet cleaning and NPLs reduction for legacy portfolios and to pay particular attention to the sustainability of banks' business models. \tNotes to the editors \tColleges bring together banking supervisors, from EU as well as non-EU areas, to jointly supervise those institutions that operate in more than one EU Member State.

The EBA expects to publish the results of the exercise in early Q3 2016. \t\u00a0 Key features of the methodology and the scenario The common methodology assesses solvency and covers all main risk types including: credit risk and securitisation, market risk, sovereign risk, funding risk and operational and conduct risks. \u00a0The 2016 EU-wide stress test is run on banks' models and the results are then challenged by supervisors in the relevant competent authorities (CAs). To ensure consistency, the methodology contains key constraints such as a static balance sheet assumption, which precludes any mitigating actions by banks, and a series of caps and floors, for example on risk weighted assets (RWAs) and net trading income. \u00a0In 2016, no pass fail threshold has been included as the objective is to use the stress test as a supervisory tool, whose results will be discussed with individual banks in the SREP process, where mitigating actions may also be considered.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 The adverse scenario, designed by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), reflects the four systemic risks that are currently assessed as representing the most material threats to the stability of the EU banking sector: i) an abrupt reversal of compressed global risk premia, amplified by low secondary market liquidity; ii) weak profitability prospects for banks and insurers in a low nominal growth environment, amid incomplete balance sheet adjustments; iii) rising of debt sustainability concerns in the public and non-financial private sectors, amid low nominal growth; iv) prospective stress in a rapidly growing shadow banking sector, amplified by spillover and liquidity risk. \tProcess \tThe EBA is responsible for coordinating the exercise and will act as a data hub for the final dissemination of the results in line with its commitment to enhancing the transparency of the EU banking sector. CAs will check the quality of the results and decide on any necessary supervisory reaction measure as part of the SREP process.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe results of the stress test will be published in early Q3 2016. \tNotes for editors \tThe EU-wide stress test will be conducted on a sample of 51 EU banks covering 70% of the banking sector in the EU and will be run at the highest level of consolidation.

The adverse scenario also includes a shock in the residential and commercial real estate prices, as well to foreign exchange rates in Central and Eastern Europe. Cumulative GDP growth in the advanced economies, including Japan and US, would be between 2.5% and 4.6% lower than under the baseline scenario in 2018.

The Authority made minor amendments to these ITS incorporating such feedback received. \t\u00a0 \tIn the short-term, these ITS maintain the current mapping in place for all ECAIs. The mapping is supported by the outcome of an impact analysis as well as by qualitative considerations. The EBA is also considering developing a securitisation-specific systematic mapping methodology mainly based on the historical performance of securitisation ratings. However, the EBA deems that some caution is needed, for the time being, due to a number of factors, including the representativeness of the data used and the ongoing review of the regulatory framework for capital requirements on securitisations at both the international and EU levels.

The Opinion is supported by a Report, which summarises the feedback received from the public consultation on the EBA discussion paper on the future of the IRB approach. \t\u00a0 \tBoth the Opinion and the Report are part of the EBA's work to identify the main regulatory actions necessary to address the key drivers of variability in the implementation of IRB models.

These changes should be supplemented by amendments to the underlying framework \u2013 beyond what is currently allowed in European legislation \u2013 in order to reduce undue variability in the implementation of the IRB models. \t\u00a0 \tIn order to ensure an efficient use of resources in institutions and supervisory authorities, the EBA calls for a flexible approach in the implementation of the regulatory review.

The guidelines ensure that institutions calculate correctly and consistently the so called \u2018bonus cap' by setting out specific criteria for mapping all remuneration components into either fixed or variable pay and detailing how specific remuneration elements such as allowances, sign-on bonuses, retention bonuses and severance pay are to be recognised over time.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the Guidelines set out the governance process for implementing sound remuneration policies across the EU and clarify the process for identifying those categories of staff to whom the specific remuneration provisions of the CRD apply, including the so called bonus cap. Guidance is also provided on the application of deferral arrangements and the pay-out instruments ensuring that variable remuneration is aligned with the institution's risk profile in the long-term and that ex-post risk adjustments can be applied as appropriate. \t\u00a0 \tConsidering the huge diversity of national rules regarding the application of proportionality, including the waiving of requirements, which has led to an uneven playing field between institutions across the EU, the EBA, in its Opinion, considers that legislative action should be taken in order to clarify and ensure that the CRD remuneration requirements are applied consistently across the EU.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn this respect, the EBA believes that a proposal for a legislative change should be considered to explicitly support specific exemptions on the application of deferral arrangements and pay out of instruments, where certain criteria are met. In particular, it is the EBA's opinion that the disapplication of these requirements should be possible for small and non-complex institutions and for staff that receives only a small amount of variable remuneration. However, the Opinion clarifies that the application of the so called \u2018bonus cap' should not be subject to any exemption. \tIn the absence of a clear legal basis for the application of waivers, the guidelines remain neutral on this particular aspect and refer to the general principle of proportionality as established in the CRD. \t\u00a0 \tA report on the national application of proportionality showing the variety in the implementation of remuneration provisions across the EU is published together with the Opinion. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA Guidelines will apply, as of 1 January 2017, to competent authorities across the EU, as well as to institutions on a solo and consolidated basis, including all subsidiaries which are not subject to the CRD IV framework. \u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tLegal basis and next steps \tThese Guidelines have been developed on the basis of Articles 74 and 75 of Directive 2013/36/EC (CRD); they complement the CRD requirements that are into force since January 2014 and take into account the EBA Opinion on the use of allowances published in October 2014.

The report shows that EU banks have continued to strengthen their capital position and to improve asset quality. However, the level of non-performing exposures remains high and profitability is still weak. The report also analyses the exposures towards emerging market (EM) countries and non-bank financial intermediaries. \t\u00a0 \tThroughout the first half of 2015, EU banks continued to strengthen their capital ratios, mainly due to retained earnings. Banks' equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 12.5 % in June, 40bps higher than in December 2014(1). This improvement has been accompanied by a modest recovery of loans and increase in risk-weighted assets. \t\u00a0 \tAsset quality improved although trends differ significantly across countries and banks. The ratio of impaired and past due loans to total loans decreased to 6.4 % in the first half of 2015, compared to 7 % at the end of 2014, and the coverage ratio increased. Banks' expectation of further gradual improvements in asset quality depends on the progress of economic recovery, which in turn is strongly dependent on developments in emerging markets.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tBanks' return on equity was 7.8 % per June 2015, 210bps higher than one year before. Despite the improvement, profitability remains weak. Banks' interest margins continue to be under pressure in a context of low interest rates. Moreover, the level of impairments, still high in many jurisdictions, together with conduct-related costs and low efficiency ratios keep their negative drag on banks' profitability. \t\u00a0 \tVolatility in banks' funding spreads demonstrates an overall fragile state of financial markets. While no major constraints could be observed in the issuance activity for secured and unsecured instruments, issuance volumes of subordinated funding have partially been subdued. On the other hand, banks have even been able to increase volumes of customer deposits even though interest rates for deposits have been on long-time lows. \t\u00a0 (1)\u00a0The sample of banks in the report is smaller compared to the one used in the EBA's 2015 Transparency Exercise. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-updates-on-risks-and-vulnerabilities-in-the-eu-banking-sector"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0920", "date": "2015-12-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA updates on the status of its final Implementing Technical Standards on benchmarking portfolios", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA), following requests from stakeholders, published today an update on the application date of its final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on benchmarking portfolios. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA had originally submitted its final draft ITS on benchmarking portfolios to the European Commission in March 2015, proposing 11 April of each year, starting in 2016, as the remittance date for the bulk of the data to be submitted by banks to competent authorities. \t\u00a0 \tConsidering that the European Commission has not yet adopted the final draft ITS, it is highly likely that the proposed remittance dates for 2016, which will be specified once the ITS are published in the EU Official Journal, will be postponed and that the remittance date for Initial Market Valuation (IMV) data will be combined with the remittance date for other ITS templates. \t\u00a0 \tThe new remittance dates will depend on the timeline of adoption of the ITS by the European Commission. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-updates-on-the-status-of-its-final-implementing-technical-standards-on-benchmarking-portfolios"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0921", "date": "2015-12-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA consults on draft Guidelines on stress testing", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a consultation on its draft Guidelines on stress testing.

The Opinion clarifies that the MDA should be calculated taking into account both minimum (Pillar 1) and additional (Pillar 2) capital requirements which should be met at all times, as well as the combined buffer requirement. The Opinion is designed to support the consistent application of distribution restrictions laid down in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) in order to promote a level playing field across the Single Market, and to give greater certainty for banks' capital planning needs. It also calls for transparency in Pillar 2 outcomes for all banks, with a view to providing clarity for investors in banks. The Opinion advises the European Commission to review the CRD text in the future to ensure certainty and more consistency. \tIn announcing the Opinion, Andrea Enria, Chairman of the EBA, said: \"Consistency in supervisory outcomes is a cornerstone of the Single Market. Clarity about the implications of supervisory decisions is similarly vital for banks undertaking capital planning and for investors in banks. The EBA's Opinion today provides both clarity and consistency in the mechanisms for the trigger and calculation of MDA across the EU\". \t\u00a0 \tThe Opinion clarifies the agreed stacking order of capital requirements, with Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 sitting at all times beneath the combined buffer. This view is supported by CRD Articles on the conditions for authorisation withdrawal, supervisory powers, and on capital buffers and is based on the clarification already provided on the stacking order of capital requirements by the EBA SREP Guidelines. \t\u00a0 \tAccordingly, the EBA Opinion re-affirms the consistency of the MDA trigger and calculation with the stacking order of capital requirements entrenched in the CRD and further clarified by the EBA SREP guidelines. The EBA also advises competent authorities to assess how any proposed MDA allocation between dividends, share buy backs, payments on Additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments and of variable remuneration would support timely capital restoration plans while not endangering institutions' funding continuity. When necessary, competent authorities are advised to use their broader supervisory powers and impose measures ensuring more consistency with such objectives. \t\u00a0 \tCognisant that the supervisory focus is moving from bail outs to bail ins, the Opinion notes the importance of MDA triggers to investors in banks' instruments such as AT1 and, consequently, of the disclosure of additional own funds imposed under the SREP. \t\u00a0 \tOn disclosure, Enria added: \"the push for increased transparency reflects our belief that if investors are to bear the costs of bank failures, they need to have access to all relevant information\". \t\u00a0 \tFinally, the EBA acknowledges that Article 141 should be reviewed by the European Commission with a view to avoid different interpretations, ensure consistency with the stacking order of capital requirements and to enable limited supervisory flexibility regarding distributions. \tNote to the editors \t\tPursuant to Article 141 of the CRD, upon breaching the combined buffer requirement (defined by Article 128(6) of CRD), banks face distribution restrictions in relation to common equity capital, AT1 instruments and variable remuneration, as determined by the Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) framework. These restrictions have the objective of capital restoration when capital buffers are breached, in contrast with the minimum requirements under Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 capital, which are to be met at all times. \t\tThe Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) is the amount of profits payable to shareholders, AT1 investors and employees not to be exceeded in order to restore capital buffers\u00a0 \t\tThe combined buffer requirement is the sum of the capital conservation buffer and any of the other applicable capital buffer requirements envisaged by the CRD (i.e. counter cyclical buffer, systemic risk buffer, G-SII/O-SII buffer). It is an additional layer of capital which banks needs to hold to counter systemic, macroprudential and other risks not covered by idiosyncratic (Pillar 1) and (Pillar 2) minimum capital requirements which sit below the combined buffer. By definition, in principle the breach of the combined buffer requirement does not prompt intrusive or resolution type supervisory measures, as can be expected in the case of the breach of Pillar 1 and/or Pillar 2. However, the breach of the combined buffer should be only temporary and banks need to implement a capital restoration plan to take capital levels above this requirement. The automatism of distribution restriction envisaged by Article 141 of CRD is intended to be a minimum common measure applicable to all banks authorised in any Member State of the European Union. \t\u00a0 \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-calls-for-more-certainty-and-consistency-in-the-application-of-restrictions-to-profits-pay-outs-to-restore-capital-adequacy"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0923", "date": "2015-12-18", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA issues advice on synthetic securitisation for SMEs", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a report summarising the findings of its analysis and market practice assessment of the synthetic securitisation market.

A major distinction arises with respect to the objectives of the transaction, whereby two main types of synthetic securitisations can be identified: \u2018balance sheet' synthetic transactions and \u2018arbitrage' synthetic transactions. In balance sheet transactions the originating credit institution uses financial guarantees or credit derivatives to transfer to third parties the credit risk of a specified pool of assets that it holds on its balance sheet while the main objective of arbitrage synthetic securitisation is one of arbitraging between the higher spread received on underlying lower credit quality debt or products indices and the lower spread paid on the resulting structured and credit-enhanced CDO note.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-issues-advice-on-synthetic-securitisation-for-smes"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0924", "date": "2015-12-17", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA defines the minimum set of information on financial contracts for detailed records", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on detailed records of financial contracts.

These RTS have been developed within the framework of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) to increase the safety and efficiency of securities settlement and settlement infrastructures. \tThe draft RTS set out the prudential framework that will apply to both CSDs offering banking-type ancillary services and licensed as a credit institution and those CSDs that are not permitted to offer such services but can designate a credit institution to that effect. The EBA specifies the framework for determining capital requirements for all CSDs along with additional requirements that will only apply to those CSDs offering banking-type ancillary services. \tThe framework for all CSDs builds on the existing banking framework and is applied in a targeted manner that takes into account the specific risk profile of CSDs and will ensure adequate protection against operational, legal, custody, investment and business risks. In addition, those CSDs providing banking-type of ancillary services will need to comply with the additional capital requirements laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). As a consequence, the EBA considered the possible differences between the CRR and CSDR regimes so as to ensure that stricter rules on prudential supervision apply, as required by the CSDR, without duplicating the existing applicable prescriptions in the CRR. \tFor CSDs offering banking-type ancillary services and licensed as a credit institution, the EBA also includes in its RTS the methodology for determining how an additional risk-based capital surcharge should be calculated, in order to better reflect the risks resulting from the provision of intraday credit.

The objective of this report is to identify any issues and areas of improvement and to propose legislative changes, where needed, to better facilitate prudential supervision of institutions on a cross-border basis. \tIn its Report, the EBA concludes that although cooperation with third country supervisory authorities does not pose any major concerns, more clarity is needed especially in the equivalence assessment processes of third country supervisory and regulatory regimes, confidentiality provisions, and consolidated supervision. \tIn its Opinion addressed to the European Commission, the EBA believes that a clear legal mandate on equivalence assessments in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) will clarify its role and will enable coordinated, consistent and continued equivalence assessments, as well as seek to ensure that the EBA has sufficient resources on an ongoing basis to fulfill these tasks.

In particular, these Guidelines introduce an approach that will allow EU institutions to set internal limits for their exposures to \u2018shadow banking entities', hence addressing in a proportionate way the risks that these exposures pose to the EU banking sector. The Guidelines were informed by a Report, also published today, on the exposures of a sample of EU institutions to \u2018shadow banking entities' and the impact of setting limits. \tThe EBA Guidelines on exposures to \u2018shadow banking entities' will support institutions and banking supervisors across the EU in minimising the risks arising from exposures to entities that carry out bank-like activities outside regulated frameworks. The Guidelines ensure institutions have sufficient information about their shadow banking counterparties so they can make an informed risk assessment of their exposures and also detail the requirements for institutions to set limits to both individual and aggregate exposures to shadow banking entities. For those institutions that do not have sufficient information on their exposures to shadow banking counterparties, the EBA requires a fallback approach involving a fixed limit to all or some of these aggregate exposures. \tThe focus of the Guidelines is on entities that pose the greatest risks in terms of both the direct exposures institutions face and also the risk of credit intermediation outside the regulated framework. For this purpose, \u2018shadow banking entities' are defined as entities that carry out credit intermediation activities (i.e. bank-like activities involving maturity transformation, liquidity transformation, leverage, credit risk transfer or similar activities) without falling within the scope of consolidated supervision (or equivalent third country legal frameworks). In addition, \u2018excluded undertakings', which are subject to an appropriate and sufficiently robust prudential framework, are not to be considered as shadow banking entities. Isabelle Vaillant, Director of Regulation at the EBA, explained that: \"Shadow banking has the potential of putting the stability of the financial system at risk\" and reminded how \"recent global financial crises have revealed fault lines which were previously unknown, but can transfer risks from the unregulated to the regulated banking system\". \tTo better understand the relevance of institutions' exposures to \u2018shadow banking entities', the EBA conducted a data collection, the first of this kind in the EU, on a sample of 184 EU institutions (169 credit institutions and 15 investment firms) in 22 Member States. The data included in the Report shows that that institutions' total exposures towards shadow banking counterparties (as defined in the Report) account for 1.082.209 million EUR and for large and internationally active banks, they represent, on average and in aggregate terms, up to 45% of their eligible capital. \tThe EBA Guidelines will apply as of 1 January 2017 and, together with the Report, will inform the European Commission's work in relation to its upcoming report on the appropriateness and impact of imposing limits on exposures to shadow banking entities. BACKGROUND AND LEGAL BASIS \tThe Guidelines have been developed in accordance with Article 395(2) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), which mandates the EBA to set limits on exposures to shadow banking entities. \tThe term \u2018shadow banking entities' has been defined in line with the previous EBA Opinion and Report on the perimeter of credit institutions and aims at capturing entities that are not subject to any prudential regulation and supervision equivalent to banking regulation. \tThe definition of \u2018shadow banking entity' used in the EBA report is broader than the definition used in the Guidelines, to capture as much information as possible and inform future work on this topic. Participating institutions were asked to report all exposures to individual \u2018shadow banking entities' (as defined in the EBA report), or at least exposures with a value equal to or in excess of 0.25 % of the institutions' eligible capital, after large exposures' exemptions and credit risk mitigation. \tShadow banking entities tend to be more vulnerable to liquidity problems, while remaining very interconnected to the banking sector, hence leading to financial stability concerns. Shadow banking entities are generally not subject to the same standards of prudential regulation as normal banking institutions. They do not have access to central banks' liquidity facilities and cannot provide protection to investors' investment in case of their failure. Exposures to shadow banking entities carrying out bank-like activities may be inherently risky and also lead to regulatory arbitrage and drive migration of banking activity from the regulated sector \u2018into the shadows'.

This report, done in consultation with the European Securities Market Authority (ESMA), presents the EBA's findings and lists a series of recommendations aiming to provide a more proportionate and less complex prudential regime for investment firms, based on appropriate risk sensitivity parameters. \tIn the Report published today, the EBA identifies the lack of risk sensitivity in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and Regulation (CRR) regime for investment firms as a primary issue to be addressed, and proposes a series of recommendations to target specific risks posed by investment firms. The variations in nature, scale and complexity of investment firms' activities are wide, but remain partially captured in the current CRD/CRR categorisation. This leads to a situation where firms that conduct similar activities and pose similar risks to market participants, might be subject to varying prudential requirements. \tThe first recommendation proposed by the EBA is a new categorisation of investment firms, which will distinguish between systemic and \"bank-like\" investment firms to which full CRD/CRR requirements should apply, and other investment firms, namely those that are considered \"not systemic\" or \"not interconnected\", for which specific requirements should be defined. \tThese categorisations would lead to a more proportional framework, with the ultimate purpose of strengthening the soundness and stability of investment firms on going concern. The EBA believes that such prudential framework for investment firms should take into account the threefold objectives of preserving financial stability, protecting investors and ensuring the orderly failure of these firms when this may be needed. \tThe EBA also suggests extending the waiver for commodity trading firms, which are currently benefitting from the exemption under both the large exposures and capital adequacy provisions, until 31 December 2020. This extension would allow regulators to assess whether a more proportionated framework is suitable for these firms.

The data, which shows improvements in the resilience of the EU banking sector, is published at the highest level of consolidation, covering around 70% of total EU banking assets for the reference dates of 31 December 2014 and 30 June 2015. By disclosing these fully comparable figures in user friendly formats, the EBA aims to promote greater understanding of capital positions and exposures of the EU banking sector and foster market discipline in the Single Market. \tComplementing the individual bank data, the EBA also published a report on the aggregate results of the exercise, summarised in the following table: \t\u00a0 CET1 ratio (transitional) Return on regulatory capital Non-Performing Loans ratio Coverage ratio of Non-Performing Loans Leverage ratio Sovereign exposures as a percentage of total leverage exposures \t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 12.8% \t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 9.1% \t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 5.6% \t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 43.3% \t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 4.9% \t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 9.7% \t\u00a0 Reference date June 2015 See the 2015 EU-wide transparency exercise results page. \tPiers Haben, Director of Oversight at the EBA explained: this transparency exercise, the EBA's fifth annual release of consistent bank by bank data, demonstrates an increasing resilience in the EU banking sector as capital levels have strengthened further. Nonetheless, EU banks will need to continue addressing the level of non-performing loans which remain a drag on profitability. Haben added that: the breadth of individual bank data, and the quality of the interactive tools available, is testimony to the EBA's efforts to enhance transparency, foster market discipline and reinforce investors' confidence. \tIn particular, the outcomes of this exercise show that, in general, EU banks have continued to strengthen their capital positions, mainly through raising additional equity and retaining earnings. This places them in a better position to increase lending to the real economy, as shown by a modest overall increase in exposures during 2015. The common equity tier 1 ratio (CET1) reached 12.8% as of June 2015, 11.8% on a fully loaded basis. Leverage ratios published here appear to have benefited from capital improvements in recent years with an EU aggregate ratio at 4.9% as of June 2015. \tThe quality of assets and the levels of profitability have also improved, albeit from a low base and remain a source of concern. Non-performing exposures, for the first time published following the EBA's harmonised definition[1], are close to 6% of total loans and advances across the EU, 10% if only non-financial corporations are considered, albeit with substantial variations across countries and banks. Profitability has improved through 2015 but remains weak by historical standards and relative to banks' estimated cost of equity. EU banks aggregate return on regulatory capital is 9.1% as of June 2015. \tFinally, in terms of sovereign exposures, the data released today shows that a home bias when investing in sovereign debt is still relevant although gradually receding, as banks reported in June 2015 an increase in their holdings of non-domestic sovereign debt. \tNote to the editors \t\tThe EBA has been conducting transparency exercises at EU-wide level on an annual basis since 2011, either linked to concurrent stress test exercises (2011 and 2014), to one-off exercises, (2011/2012 recapitalisation exercise), or specific solely transparency exercises where non-stressed actual data were published for a sample of banks, like in 2013 or the current 2015 exercise. \t\tTransparency exercises, just like stress tests, are conducted by the EBA on a regular basis at EU-wide level and cover the largest EU banks at their highest level of consolidation. Both types of exercise aim at promoting market and supervisory discipline and providing transparency on banks' exposures, so as to address any uncertainties that may still remain. However, unlike stress tests, transparency exercises are purely disclosure exercises where only bank-by-bank data are published and no shocks are applied to the actual data. \t\tFor the first time, the 2015 transparency exercise is mainly based on existing supervisory reporting data which is submitted to the EBA on a regular basis, with the exception of data on sovereign exposures and leverage ratio which have been provided by banks ad hoc. This way, banks' reporting burden is minimised significantly, using already available data inputs that have undergone rigorous quality checks.

By determining an objective approach for attributing risk weights to the assessments of ECAIs, as well as a prudential approach for those cases lacking factual evidence, these standards will ensure sound credit assessments contributing to financial stability in the EU. \tThe standards issued today by the ESAs are part of the EU Single Rulebook for banking and insurance aimed at creating a safe and sound regulatory framework consistently applicable across the European Union (EU). The work of the ESAs is intended to ensure that only credit ratings issued by External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) \u2013 those credit rating agencies registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 or central banks issuing credit ratings exempt from the application of the same regulation - can be used for calculating capital requirements of financial institutions and insurance undertakings. \tIn order to determine the allocation of appropriate risk weights to the credit ratings issued by ECAIs, the three ESAs have specified an approach that establishes the correspondence -or \u2018mapping'- between credit ratings and the credit quality steps defined in the EU prudential regulation for banking (Capital Requirements Regulation \u2013 CRR) and insurance (Solvency II Directive). The factors and benchmarks that need to be taken into consideration to this end are specified in these ITS. \tThe ESAs also addressed situations where the degree of risk underlying a credit assessment cannot be ascertained due to the lack of factual evidence. Credit rating agencies that can only provide limited data sets will be required to apply a transitional period of three years, during which quantitative information can be collected in view of a second mapping which is to take place at the end of the three years. \tBy striking a sound balance between prudential and market concerns, these ITS will ensure the prudential use of credit ratings across the EU for the calculation of capital requirements, hence driving confidence in the EU financial sector.

The stress test will be formally launched in the first quarter of 2016 and will cover over 70% of the EU banking sector and will assess EU banks' ability to meet relevant supervisory capital ratios during an adverse economic shock. The results will inform the 2016 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), acting as a challenge to banks' forward looking capital plans. The exercise will also provide market participants with a consistent basis to compare and assess the resilience of EU banks. The list of institutions participating in the exercise is also released today. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA informed today that the 2016 EU-wide banking stress test exercise will be carried out at the highest level of consolidation on a sample of banks covering broadly 70% of the banking sector in the EU, as expressed in terms of total consolidated assets as of end 2014. 53 EU banks will participate in the exercise, 39 of which fall under the jurisdiction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). No single capital threshold is defined for this exercise as banks will be assessed against relevant supervisory capital ratios under a static balance sheet and the results will inform the 2016 round of Supervisory Review and Evaluation Processes (SREP) under which decisions are made on appropriate capital resources and forward looking capital plans are challenged. \t\u00a0 \tThe resilience of EU banks will be assessed against a common macroeconomic baseline and adverse scenario based on year-end 2015 figures, and applied over a period of three years to end-2018. The approach of the exercise is that of constrained bottom-up stress test, where banks will be required to project the impact but subject to strict constraints defined in the common methodology.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe objective of the EU-wide stress test is to provide supervisors, banks and other market participants with a common analytical framework to consistently compare and assess the resilience of the EU banking system to shocks. \tTimeline \tThe 2016 EU-wide stress test will be launched at the end of February 2016 with a publication of the final methodology and templates as well as the scenarios. The outcomes of the exercise, including banks' individual results, are expected to be published at the beginning of Q3 2016. An expedited publication is designed to align the finalisation of the exercise with the cycle of the annual supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), as this will ensure the results of the stress test are incorporated as an input to that process. \tMethodology and templates \tSimilar to the 2014 exercise, the 2016 EU-wide stress test is primarily focused on the assessment of the impact of risk drivers on the solvency of banks. Banks are required to stress test a common set of risks (credit risk including securitisations, market risk and counterparty credit risk, operational risk including conduct risk). In addition, banks are requested to project the effect of the scenarios on net interest income and to stress P&L and capital items not covered by other risk types. The 2016 exercise adds an explicit treatment of conduct risk and FX lending to its scope. Today's publication of the draft methodology and templates is the starting point for an informal discussion with banks so as to receive their input, which will be taken into account when finalising both documents. Regular discussions with banks will also help prepare for the exercise. \tThe process \tThe process for running the 2016 EU-wide stress test involves close cooperation between the EBA, the competent authorities (including the Single Supervisory Mechanism \u2013 SSM), the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the European \u00a0Commission. Scenarios, methodology, minimum quality assurance guidance and templates are agreed by the EBA's Board of Supervisors in close collaboration with competent authorities. The macroeconomic adverse scenario and any risk type specific shocks linked to the scenario are developed by the ESRB and the ECB in close cooperation with competent authorities, the EBA and the European Commission.

The draft Guidelines also introduce three principles that should be considered when disclosing such information: \t\u00a0 \t\tAs a general rule, confidential information should relate to a minimum number of three institutions or entities. \u00a0 \t\tNo references should be made to specific characteristics, distinctive features, names or numerical, qualitative and other distinctive data which would allow the identification of the individual institutions or entities; \t\tDisclosure of confidential information should be avoided under specific circumstances, which would pose a risk that the individual institutions or entities could be identifiable. \tConsultation process \tComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

The aim of these Guidelines is to provide credit and financial institutions with the tools they need to make informed, risk-based and proportionate decisions on the effective management of individual business relationships and occasional transactions. They also aim to help competent authorities assess whether the ML/TF risk assessment and management systems and controls of EU credit and financial institutions are adequate. \tConsultation process \tThe consultation closes on 22 January 2016.

The Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1st January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \t\u00a0 \t2. Through the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely and ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition to being a forum for cooperation, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). \t\u00a0 \t3. These guidelines are based on mandates in Articles 17, 18(4) and 48(10) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing. \t\u00a0 \t4. Directive (EU) 2015/849 puts the risk-based approach at the centre of the EU's AML/CFT regime. It recognises that the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing may vary and that Member States, competent authorities and credit and financial institutions should identify and assess risks in order to decide how to best manage it.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-eiopa-and-esma-consult-on-anti-money-laundering-and-countering-the-financing-of-terrorism"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0967", "date": "2015-10-16", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes work programme for 2016", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its detailed annual work programme for 2016, describing the specific activities and tasks of the Authority for the coming year, as well as a multiannual work programme, highlighting the key strategic areas of work in the coming years (from 2016 to 2018).\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA's work for 2016 is defined under eight strategic areas and 34 activities.

This includes work on completing the liquidity and leverage framework, under the Capital Requirements legislation (CRDIV/CRR); input to the Commission's legislative initiatives, such as in the area of covered bonds and securitisation under the Capital Markets Union and structural reform; completion of the EBA's mandates under the Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD); providing answers to the EBA's Q&A tool regarding the implementation of the CRDIV/CRR and BRRD frameworks. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA's risk analysis and assessment work will continue to focus on identifying, analysing and addressing key risks in the EU banking sector.

To that end, the EBA has developed a formula to calculate the rate and would now like to hear the views from consumer and industry stakeholders on the approach it is proposing. The consultation runs until 20 November 2015. \tIn Annexes I and II, the MCD sets out the information that creditors must include in the ESIS. This includes information about the interest rate and other costs, and specifically requires that, for a variable borrowing rate, the ESIS includes a warning that the variability could affect the actual level of the Annual Percentage Rate of Charge (APRC). The warning shall be accompanied by an illustrative example of the APRC. In addition, under the heading of \"Amount of each instalment\", the ESIS must include a statement indicating that the borrowing rate is variable and an illustration of a maximum instalment amount. \tThe MCD provides that in certain circumstances the two illustrative examples are to be calculated by creditors using a benchmark rate specified by the EBA. In order to fulfil this task, i.e. to calculate the illustrative example of the APRC and the illustrative instalment amount for the ESIS, the EBA has developed a draft formula \u00a0with which creditors are to calculate the rate. \tBy producing a formula instead of a single rate, the EBA seeks to ensure that its rate is representative of national circumstances. The formula uses as input an underlying rate that is specific to each Member State, either the European Central Bank (ECB) rate for Eurozone countries or the Member State's central bank rate for non-Eurozone countries. \tThe EBA wishes to hear the views of consumer, industry and other interested stakeholders on whether the proposed benchmark rate will achieve the purpose stated in the MCD and whether it will succeed in illustrating to consumers the potential variability of their mortgage borrowing rate. \tOnce finalised, the formula will be published on the EBA's website prior to entry into force of the MCD on 21 March 2016. \tConsultation process \tComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

In this Opinion, the Authority raises concerns about the possible unintended consequence that a harmonised definition of MLV across the CRR might have on the EU covered bonds market. \t\u00a0 \tMLV is a concept defined in the CRR, and refers to a prudent and long-term value of immovable property. The term MLV is referred to in several areas of the CRR, namely in the credit risk area, the credit risk mitigation framework, the large exposure regime, and indirectly in the context of eligibility criteria for the covered bond preferential risk weights. \t\u00a0 \tIn its Opinion, the EBA explains that the application of a harmonised concept of MLV could have a disruptive impact in the covered bonds market across the EU both from a legal and financial stability perspective. In particular, the Opinion highlights the operational consequences of a change in the valuation of immovable property collateral, and the fact that such valuation plays a central role in the calculation of capital requirements in covered bond markets. \t\u00a0 \tWhile stressing the importance of pan-EU harmonisation of the MLV concept, the EBA is of the opinion that the scope of application of the RTS on MLV should be limited to the credit risk area, the credit risk mitigation and the large exposure framework. Therefore, the EBA is advising the Commission to initiate appropriate legislative steps with a view to limiting the scope of these RTS on MLV. \t\u00a0 \tIn light of the concerns raised, the EBA called on the EU Commission to clarify the scope of the mandate laid down in the CRR so as to avoid these possible unintended implications, which could happen in the context of the work on the Capital Markets Union and a comprehensive review of EU covered bond frameworks. Until such clarification is provided, the EBA will not work further on its mandate. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe EBA is mandated in Article 124(4)(a) of the CRR to deliver technical standards, which harmonise the concept of MLV in the CRR. The EBA's competence to deliver the Opinion is based on Article 34(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. In accordance with Article 14(5) of the Rules of Procedure of this Board of Supervisors the Opinion has been adopted by the Board of Supervisors. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-seeks-legislative-clarifications-on-mortgage-lending-value"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0976", "date": "2015-09-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA looks at asset encumbrance in EU banks", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its first analysis of asset encumbrance among EU banking institutions.

The report will be published on a yearly basis in the future, as data quality improves with the full establishment of reporting requirements for asset encumbrance, a key component of risk management policies and decision making processes in the EU banking sector. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA preliminary analysis shows that in March 2015 the overall weighted average encumbrance ratio was 27%, but highlights a wide dispersion across institutions and countries.

Streamlined information will help EU banking supervisors assess how banks can handle funding stress and switch from unsecured to secured funding under stressed conditions. \t\u00a0 \tThe report issued today was carried out on the basis of data on asset encumbrance received in 2015 from a sample of almost 200 EU banks. The analysis should be seen as preliminary, while the reporting process for asset encumbrance becomes fully established among EU banking institutions. In line with the EBA's implementing technical standards on asset encumbrance from October 2013, asset encumbrance should be considered a key component of risk management policies and decision making processes in the EU banking sector. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-looks-at-asset-encumbrance-in-eu-banks"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0977", "date": "2015-09-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Andrea Enria's lectio magistralis at the University of Padova", "text": " \tAndrea Enria, Chairperson of the EBA, gave a lecture on \"The Single Rulebook in banking: is it \u2018single' enough?\" at the University of Padova.

However, the EBA supports the proposed amendment by the European Commission with regard to the application date of the ITS from 1 July 2015 to 1 January 2016. \tThe final draft ITS submitted by EBA on 18 December 2013 (a slightly updated submission took place on 24 July 2014) include a set of metrics relating to the additional monitoring tools which are designed to complement the supervision of an institution's liquidity risk beyond the scenario for which the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is defined. These final draft ITS were built on the basis of the definition of liquid assets for the purposes of reporting in the CRR. \tThe Commission considers that the maturity ladder needs to be adapted to the detailed definitions of liquid assets set by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 (Delegated Act on the LCR), published in the Official Journal on 17 January 2015. For this reason, the Commission suggests removing the maturity ladder from the ITS also because, in its view, it would avoid unnecessary regulatory burden and the duplication of implementation costs for the industry. \tAs explained in detail in the Opinion, the EBA, while sharing some of the concerns raised by the EU Commission, deems it essential to keep the maturity ladder in the ITS considering the relevance of the metric in the liquidity risk assessment by supervisors and the need to have a harmonised metric for this purpose. On the other hand, the EBA supports the proposed amendment made by the Commission on the date of application of the ITS to be moved from 1 July 2015 to 1 January 2016. \tBackground and legal basis \tThe final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on additional liquidity monitoring metrics have been developed according to Article 415(3)(b) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and were submitted to the Commission for endorsement on 18 December 2013. \tOn 13 August 2015, the Commission informed the EBA that in accordance with the procedure set out in the fifth subparagraphs of Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, it intended to amend the final draft ITS submitted by the EBA. \tThe EBA's competence to deliver an opinion is based on the fifth subparagraph of Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

The consultation runs until 22 January 2016 and the EBA is also asking the public for feedback on a Quantitative Impact Assessment (QIS) of the Guidelines. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA Guidelines launched for public consultation today harmonise the definition of default across the EU prudential framework, which will in turn improve consistency in the way EU banks apply regulatory requirements to their capital positions. A detailed clarification of the definition of default and its application is provided in these Guidelines, which cover key aspects, such as the days past due criterion for default identification, indications of unlikeliness to pay, conditions for the return to non-defaulted status, treatment of the definition of default in external data, application of the default definition in a banking group and specific aspects related with retail exposures. \t\u00a0 \tThe tools provided in the Guidelines will allow for increased comparability of own funds requirements, as well as for a reduction in the variability of the risk estimates under the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach.

This exercise, run in parallel with the one conducted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) at a global level, allows the gathering of aggregate results on capital ratios and leverage ratio (LR), as well as on liquidity ratios - liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) - for banks in the European Union (EU). \tThe exercise monitors the impact of the transposition of the Basel III requirements on EU banks. In particular, it monitors the impact of fully-implemented Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV / CRR) on capital and risk-weighted assets (RWA), and the impact of fully implementing the Basel III framework on leverage ratio (LR) and liquidity ratios (LCR and NSFR) using data as of December 2014 under a static balance sheet assumption. \tResults show that the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1) of the largest internationally-active European banks (Group 1 banks) would be on average 11.4% under full implementation compared to a ratio of 12.2% under the current implementation of the regulation. None of the Group 1 banks would face a CET1 capital shortfall to achieve the minimum requirement of 4.5%, while the same group of banks would be short of EUR 1.5 billion to reach the 7.0% level (minimum CET1 of 4.5% plus capital conservation buffer of 2.5%). The shortfall figure remains the same when the surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) is considered. For Group 1 banks, the overall impact of fully-implemented CRD IV / CRR on the CET1 ratio is mostly attributed to changes in the definition of capital, while the changes related to the calculation of RWA have marginally contributed to the change of CET1 ratio. \tThe fully-implemented leverage ratio (LR) of Group 1 banks would be 4.2%, assuming the joint compliance with the 6% Tier 1 capital requirement. The shortfall for Group 1 banks to meet all risk-sensitive capital and LR ratios would be EUR 19.4 billion. \tAs for the LCR, results show that as of December 2014, the average LCR of Group 1 banks would have been 123.7%. Approximately 87% of the total sample of banks would have already met the final 100% Basel III requirement to be reached by 2019. In addition, the exercise reveals a shortfall of liquid assets of EUR 38.3 billion for Group 1 banks. \tThe results for NSFR indicate that, as of June 2014, the average fully-implemented NSFR would have been 102% and 109% for Group 1 and Group 2 banks, respectively. The NSFR figures show that the need for more stable funding would amount to EUR 523 billion, approximately 4.5% of total assets of all non-compliant banks participating in the NSFR part of the monitoring exercise. The increase in the need for more stable funding in December 2014, in relation to June 2014, is attributed to the broader sample of banks included in the December 2014 monitoring exercise. Note to the editors \t\tA total of\u00a0364 EU banks submitted data for the exercise\u00a0on a voluntary and confidential basis, of which 53 banks belong to Group 1 (with a Tier\u00a01 capital exceeding EUR 3 billion and internationally active) and 311 banks belong to Group\u00a02 (all other banks). \t\tThe results of the current report should be treated cautiously when compared with results from the previous exercises, as the sample of participating banks has significantly increased. \t\tUnless otherwise stated, the capital, leverage and liquidity ratios in the monitoring exercise report refer to the full implementation of the CRD IV\u2013CRR/Basel III framework. \u00a0 \t\tWhen referring to the capital ratios and shortfalls, the current implementation of the CRD IV\u2013CRR differs from the full implementation of the CRD IV\u2013CRR due to transitional arrangements. \t\tThe results of this study are not comparable to industry estimates, as they do not include assumptions regarding banks' future profitability, changes in capital or balance sheet composition, nor further management actions that could be taken in response to the new Basel framework. \t\tThe results of previous exercises in this series were published in\u00a0June 2014, September 2014,\u00a0March 2014,\u00a0September 2013,\u00a0March 2013,\u00a0September 2012\u00a0and\u00a0April 2012. \t\tAt the end of 2015, the EBA will also publish the NSFR impact assessment report which will present a more detailed analysis on NSFR, in accordance with its mandate under Article 510 of the CRR.

Risks resulting from low interest rates, search for yield and low profitability of financial institutions remain present, along with risks related to reductions in market liquidity and their possible implications for asset managers. The fragile recovery of European economies continues to adversely affect profitability and asset quality of the EU's financial sector.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tCurrently, the main risks challenging financial stability in the EU are:\u00a0 \t\tthe low interest rate environment and its impact on the profitability and business model sustainability of financial institutions;\u00a0 \t\tthe continued search for yield by financial institutions and the associated mispricing of assets;\u00a0 \t\tpolitical and economic risks due to residual uncertainty around Greece's financial situation;\u00a0 \t\tfinancial market volatility and structural concerns about economic prospects of emerging market economies, in particular in China; and \t\treductions in market liquidity;\u00a0 \tESAs call for rigorous action on asset quality and business models\u00a0 \tThe ESAs' report highlights the need for further efforts by financial entities to clean-up balance sheets, to address legacy assets and non-performing loans \u2013 this includes assessing the sustainability of business models as a key supervisory concern. The report stresses a specific need for coordination when conducting such assessments for cross-border and cross-sector institutions. It also points to the risks of valuation risks in illiquid markets and emphasises the transparent disclosure of risk exposures (e.g. as part of periodic financial reporting). The report also calls for further appropriate and harmonised regulation promoting the adequate marketing of investment products and complementing recent plans to support market-based funding. \tESAs see further risks looming ahead \tThe joint risk report also identifies some potential risk drivers for the developments ahead. It highlights the possible re-emergence of concerns on sovereign debt sustainability, reflecting high public and private sector indebtedness, large fiscal deficits and insufficient fiscal consolidation in some countries. This could trigger a change in market sentiment if a further tightening in credit spreads would not be in line with future economic developments. Such concerns apply particularly in the euro area, also in reaction to potential adverse developments regarding the long-term development of the Greek economy. Another potential trigger for a change of sentiment in European markets could be increasing international risks, e.g. following heightened market volatility, structural concerns about China's economy, fluctuations in commodity prices or divergence of monetary policy conditions between major jurisdictions. Adverse spill-over effects from China, or other emerging market economies facing reduced growth, could provide further challenges to the EU economy. \t\tNotes for editors August 2015 Joint Committee Report on Risks and Vulnerabilities in the EU financial system. \t\t\tThe Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1st January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \t\t\tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely and ensure consistency in their practices.

In particular, the updated taxonomy incorporates revised reporting structures for leverage ratio, and new parallel reporting structures for liquidity ratio for credit institutions. These changes represent the amendments to the ITS on supervisory reporting resulting from the Commission's adoption of Delegated Acts amending the definition of the Leverage Ratio (LR) and specifying a new Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) framework. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tIn addition, the new taxonomy gives effect to the answer to the Single Rulebook question 2014_1042, which specifies that figures for LCR and Net Stable Funding Requirements (NSFR) templates with breakdowns in significant currencies should be reported in units of the relevant significant currency (and so such reports may contain values which are not all expressed in the same currency). \t\t\u00a0 \t\tThe following documents have been published today:\u00a0 \t\t\tA set of XML files forming the XBRL taxonomy \t\t\tA description of the architecture of the XBRL taxonomy \t\t\tA description of the Data Point Model (DPM), of which the taxonomy is a standardised technical implementation, including both a database and document representations, along with a description of the formal modelling methodology by which the DPM is defined \t\tThe EBA also published today an extension (2.3.2) to the currently applicable XBRL taxonomy set 2.3.1, providing representations of FINREP reports for individual entity consolidation scope. The new DPM and taxonomy elements in 2.3.2 parallel those already existing for consolidated FINREP reports, and are provided by the EBA in order to facilitate further harmonisation of regulatory reporting at the European level. It should be noted that 2.3.2 only adds additional, independent reports for individual consolidation scope FINREP, and makes no changes to existing 2.3.1 reports, with which it is directly compatible at the instance level. As such, it may be ignored by entities not needing to prepare or consume individual scope FINREP reports.\u00a0 \t\tApplicability \t\tSince the amended LCR and LR ITS will apply 6 months from the date of their publication in the Official Journal, the new 2.4 taxonomy will apply for reference dates following their point of application. Note that this same application date will apply to the whole 2.4 taxonomy set, including reports other than LCR and LR. The new LCR templates are applicable to credit institutions and not to investment firms, the latter will continue reporting the LCR items using the (2.4 multicurrency version of the) current LCR templates. \t\tRegarding 2.3.2, it is not anticipated that individual FINREP data will be remitted to the EBA in the near term, and so the extension will have no relevant applicability at the EBA level. It is however anticipated that competent authorities may choose independently to make use of this harmonised taxonomy in their data collection processes, for example under the ECB's regulation on supervisory financial information. \t\tBackground and legal basis \t\tThe taxonomy defines a representation for data collection under the reporting requirements related to own funds, financial information, losses stemming from lending collateralised by immovable property, large exposures, leverage ratio, liquidity ratios, asset encumbrance, additional liquidity monitoring metrics, supervisory benchmarking and funding plans. As part of enhancing regulatory harmonisation in the EU banking sector and facilitating cross-border supervision, uniform data formats are necessary to enable comparable data on credit institutions and investment firms across the EU. \t\t\u00a0 \t\tAlthough, the EBA XBRL taxonomy was primarily developed for data transmission between competent authorities and the EBA, many authorities have been using it for the collection of supervisory reporting from the credit institutions and investment firms they supervise. In this respect, the taxonomy proposed by the EBA will lead to greater efficiency and convergence of supervisory practices across Members States. In addition, it will facilitate the supervisory process, allowing supervisors to identify and assess risks consistently across the EU and to compare EU banks in an effective manner. \t\t\u00a0 \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-new-dpm-and-xbrl-taxonomy-for-remittance-of-supervisory-reporting"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0987", "date": "2015-09-07", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA updates on remuneration practices and high earners data for 2013 across the EU", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a report combining the benchmarking of remuneration practices across the European Union and aggregated data on the remuneration of EU institutions' staff who received, in total, EUR one million or more in 2013. The analysis focuses, in particular, on the identification of staff, the application of deferral arrangements and the pay out in instruments, as well as on the use of specific remuneration elements, such as guaranteed variable remuneration and severance payments. The report shows that the number of high earners slightly decreased since 2012 and that the ratio between the variable and fixed remuneration paid to identified staff was further reduced in 2013. This report is part of the EBA's work on institutions' staff remuneration policies aimed at ensuring prudent and sustainable risk taking in the EU banking sector. \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the report shows that the number of high earners decreased from 3 530 staff in 2012 to 3 178 staff in 2013 and that the percentage of high earners having a material impact on an institution's risk profile, \u2018identified staff', has slightly increased over time from 53.68% in 2012 to 59.00% in 2013. Nevertheless, the level of 'identified staff' differs significantly across similar institutions. This trend is likely to change in the future following the adoption, in 2014, of the Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) on identified staff. \t\u00a0 \tIn addition, the report highlights that remuneration practices within institutions were not sufficiently harmonised. In particular, the application of deferral and pay-out in instruments differed significantly across Member States and institutions.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tOverall, it can be also observed that the ratio between the variable and fixed remuneration paid to identified staff was further reduced in 2013 and is now around 104% although in many business areas and institutions this ratio is above the bonus cap that applies for performance year 2014 and onwards. This is likely to further decrease following the entry into force of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRDIV) in 2014, which introduced the so called \u2018bonus cap', thus limiting the ratio of the variable and the fixed component of remuneration to 100% (200% if approved by the shareholders).\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThis report will be updated on an annual basis and the analysis based on 2014 figures is expected to be released by the end of 2015.

The EBA will try to incorporate these aspects into its reports to the maximum extent possible and taking into account constraints in data availability. \t\u00a0 \tThe LR and NSFR requirements have been developed by the Basel Committee in the aftermath of recent financial crises and the work carried out by the EBA will ensure that institutions in the EU banking sector can use stable sources of funding without building up excessive leverage. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA is mandated to elaborate a calibration report on NSFR by the end of 2015 and on LR by October 2016, but it informed today that the delivery date of the latter is likely to be advanced to July 2016. \tNote to the editors \tArticles 510 (1) and (2) and 511 (3) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) require the EBA to elaborate calibration reports on NSFR and LR respectively. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-to-conduct-further-analysis-on-net-stable-funding-requirements-and-leverage-ratio"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_0989", "date": "2015-08-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Board of Appeal of the ESAs dismisses appeal by Romanian insurer against EIOPA decision", "text": " The Board of Appeal of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) has ruled against an appeal by Onix Asigurari SA, a Romanian insurer, on a decision by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). \tThe EIOPA decision related to a challenge by Onix Asigurari SA against IVASS, the Italian insurance regulator.\u00a0 The Board of Appeal decided that the appeal was inadmissible, since it was not an appeal against a \"decision\" of EIOPA such as to give a right of appeal.

The Opinion ensures full protection of well-established sources of refinancing such as secured debt, including securities lending and covered bonds, and of means of risk mitigation. The Opinion is issued today in response to a request for advice from the European Commission and it will inform its delegated acts on the classes of arrangements to be protected in a partial transfer of the property of a bank under resolution. \t\u00a0 \tThe BRRD lists five general categories of arrangements which may be protected (security arrangements, title transfer collateral arrangements, set-off arrangements, netting arrangements, covered bonds and structured finance arrangements). As these categories are quite broad, the scope needs to be further specified, and the Commission is empowered to do so in its delegated acts. \t\u00a0 \tThe underlying principle proposed by the EBA in this Opinion aims at allowing effective separation and transfer of critical functions of the failing bank to another entity under a framework of safeguards. The resolution authority should have sufficient flexibility in splitting the balance sheet to reach the resolution objectives. \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the EBA recommends that the European Commission's delegated acts provide the highest possible degree of legal certainty with regard to the integrity of the arrangement as a whole and minimise the risk of legal challenges. At the same time, the delegated acts should avoid hampering the use of partial transfers within the application of a resolution tool and preventing contracts that would create an impediment to a partial transfer without a legitimate interest. On the other hand, the criteria in the delegated acts should not impair legitimate interests in developing new products and in structuring transactions. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA underlines that the protection granted should reflect the economic rationale for the specific legal treatment. This in particular applies to the function of protected arrangements in relation to reducing systemic risk in financial markets by minimising contagion, and should take into account whether they are recognised for this purpose under the applicable regulatory rules. In the same vein, statutory protection of those arrangements in Member States' insolvency laws should be taken into consideration.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tAccordingly, the EBA also recommends that in the case of set-off and netting arrangements, the protection should be limited to arrangements covering financial contracts, and to those recognised under prudential rules.\u00a0 \tLegal basis and background\u00a0 \tArticle 76(4) of the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive (BRRD) mandates the European Commission to adopt delegated acts further specifying the classes of arrangement that fall within the scope of points (a) to (f) of Article 76(2) and consequently are protected in a partial property transfer. The Commission has requested the EBA to provide an opinion with technical advice on this mandate. The appropriate form of protection is specified in the BRRD, therefore, the EBA technical advice, provided according to Art. 8(1)(a) of the EBA Regulation, is not meant to address this point. Typically the safeguard means that either none or all of the assets and liabilities covered by the protected arrangement may be transferred (i.e. it would not be possible to transfer some, but not all of them). This, however, may impair the effectiveness or the partial property transfer as a resolution tool. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the scope of the safeguard is limited to what is needed to ensure legal certainty for the investors and the protection only of legitimate interests. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-technical-advice-on-protected-arrangements-in-a-resolution-situation"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_0991", "date": "2015-08-11", "text_type": "PR", "title": "The EBA issues final Guidelines on passport notifications for mortgage credit intermediaries", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final Guidelines on passport notifications for mortgage credit intermediaries in support of the transposition of the Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD).

Through this paper, which is the basis for a preliminary discussion, the EBA is inviting its stakeholders to provide their input and evidence aimed at supporting the ongoing analysis on bank lending to SMEs and the impact of the SME SF. The final document, which will inform the European Commission's own report on the impact of own funds requirements on lending to SMEs, is expected to be published in the first quarter of 2016. The consultation runs until 1 October 2015. \tSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) are key players in the EU economy in terms of their share in employment and value added. Nevertheless, they remain largely reliant on bank-related lending to finance their activities. In the context of this dependence on bank lending, and given the increased regulatory burden following the financial crisis, a capital reduction factor for loans to SMEs \u2013 the so-called SME supporting factor (SF) - was introduced in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) to allow credit institutions to enhance lending to this particular group of companies. \tIn the context of this capital reduction, the EBA has the mandate to report to the European Commission on: a) an analysis of the evolution of the lending trends and conditions for SMEs; (b) an analysis of effective riskiness of EU SMEs over a full economic cycle; and (c) the consistency of own funds requirements laid down in the CRR for credit risk on exposures to SMEs with the outcomes of the aforementioned analyses. \tThis call for evidence aims to initiate a discussion on the key issues to be addressed in the final report and is accompanied by a set of questions aimed at collecting evidence and views from the industry and other stakeholders to further support the analysis in the report as well as at raising any potential objections to the current analysis. \tConsultation process \tComments/evidence to these consultations can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

The reports summarise the findings obtained from two benchmarking exercises conducted in line with the mandate laid down in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and related draft technical standards. The benchmarking exercises aim at improving the comparability of EU banks' RWAs and are a crucial tool to restoring trust in internal models. \t\u00a0 \tThe LDP analysis explains how much of the variability in RWAs is led by difference in riskiness \u2013 i.e., idiosyncratic portfolio features \u2013 and tries to identify residual drivers that are linked to banks' practices. A key finding is that three-quarters of the observed difference in \u2018global charge' (GC) levels across institutions could be explained by the proportion of defaulted exposures in the portfolio and the portfolio mix. When looking at each portfolio separately, the analysis shows that the impact of defaulted exposures explains about 40% of the GC differences for the large corporate portfolios, while the remaining 60% may be due to differences in bank-specific factors, such as risk management practices. \t\u00a0 \tAs for the CCR and ACVA analyses, which have been carried out in close cooperation with the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS), the report shows that there is significant variability across banks in the calculation of counterparty credit risk and advanced credit value adjustments, especially for equity and foreign exchange OTC derivatives. \t\u00a0 \tThese findings will inform the work the EBA is conducting for improving the regulatory framework and restoring confidence in internal models. A deeper understanding of what drives differences in RWAs will allow the EBA to explore a number of options to address specific concerns, as put forward in the EBA report on CVA as well as in the discussion paper on the future of the IRB Approach published by the EBA in February and March 2015 respectively. \t\u00a0 How to use the 2014 LDP report \t\tThe 2014 LDP report could be used in conjunction with the information on EU banks' risk parameters disclosed as part of the 2014 Stress Test Exercise and published in December 2014 (annexes to the EBA Risk Dashboard Q1 2014 and Q3 2014).

The EBA analysis identified best practices carried out by some NCAs, but also highlighted significant differences remaining between NCAs' supervisory approaches. The EBA concluded that the existing EBA guidelines have not led to sufficient convergence in supervisory practices, and proposed the incorporation in its forthcoming review of the guidelines of a number of specific best practices observed. The EBA also intends to send an opinion to the European Commission suggesting a change in the underlying Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) framework. Despite most NCAs being assessed as being fully or largely compliant with the EBA guidelines, the peer review assessment highlighted that the EBA Guidelines have not led to sufficiently convergent supervisory practices. Differences in actual practices include the definition of suitability, the criteria used by NCAs and institutions to assess the candidates' suitability, the approach regarding the suitability of key function holders and the notion of independence of members of the management body. In addition, the report reveals some best practices observed of some NCAs, including the practice of assessing candidates for key positions by performing interviews, the application of the proportionality principle and the criteria used to assess suitability. The EBA proposes that the current guidelines be updated to incorporate these identified best practices so as to improve the level of convergence across NCAs' practices and also to reflect its mandates under the CRD.

Notably, the 2016 exercise will be based on a constrained bottom up approach, including a static balance sheet assumption and wide risk coverage to assess EU banks' solvency. \tThe 2016 EU-wide stress test will however, build on the lessons learned from previous exercises and, for example, will be more closely aligned with the cycle of the annual supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), to ensure the results of the stress test are incorporated as an input to that process. \tThe draft methodology and templates will be discussed with relevant stakeholders before the end of 2015 and the detailed aspects and milestones of the exercise will be communicated in the coming months.\u00a0 \tThe 2016 EU-wide exercise is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2016, with the release of the detailed scenario and methodology. The assessment and quality checks are expected to be concluded by the third quarter of 2016, when EU banks' individual results will be released. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-updates-on-upcoming-transparency-exercise-and-on-key-features-of-2016-eu-wide-stress-test"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1004", "date": "2015-07-15", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes final product oversight and governance requirements for manufactures and distributors of retail banking products", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final Guidelines on product oversight and governance (POG) arrangements for retail banking products. These Guidelines set out requirements for manufacturers and distributors when designing and bringing to market mortgages, personal loans, deposits, payment accounts, payment services and electronic money. The Guidelines are the EBA's response to increasing risks arising from the mis-conduct of financial institutions in their interaction with consumers and are part of the EBA's work to enhance consumer protection across the EU. The Guidelines will apply from 03 January 2017. \tThe mis-conduct of financial institutions can cause significant consumer detriment, undermine market confidence, threaten the integrity of the financial system, and incur large costs to wider society. According to a recent report of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), banks have incurred aggregate costs of \u20ac200bn since 2009 as a result of fines, settlements and redress payments, \u20ac50bn of which by banks in the European Union. \tIn order to address some of these conduct risks, the EBA has developed detailed Guidelines on product oversight and governance arrangements for the retail banking products that fall into its consumer protection remit, which are: mortgages, personal loans, deposits, payment accounts, payment services, and electronic money. \tThe Guidelines provide a framework for robust and responsible product design and distribution by manufacturers and distributors. The first part of the Guidelines consists of requirements for manufacturers with regard to their internal control functions; the identification of the target market; product testing; disclosure; product monitoring, remedial actions, and distribution channels. The second part consists of requirements for distributors related to the distributor's governance; the identification and knowledge of the target market; and information requirements. \tBackground \tThese Guidelines have been developed building on the initial work carried out by the Joint Committee of the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) for the banking, investment and insurance sectors, which resulted in a \u2018Joint Position' of the three ESA published in November 2013. Based on the Joint Position, the EBA carried out subsequent and more detailed work on product oversight and governance arrangements for the banking sector in 2014 and 2015. This resulted in draft EBA Guidelines which were subject to a three-month consultation period between November 2014 and February 2015. \tFollowing the publication of the English version today, the EBA will make available, in due course, the translations of these Guidelines in all EU languages. Within two months from the publication of the translated Guidelines, competent authorities shall confirm to the EBA their compliance status, which will be disclosed on the EBA website.

These Technical Standards and Guidelines specify the conditions under which one entity of a banking group can provide support to another entity of the same group in financial difficulties. These have been developed within the framework established by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and aim at strengthening integrated risk management in EU banking groups by removing possible uncertainties around supporting entities in distress within the same group. \t\u00a0 \tThese RTS and Guidelines establish a harmonised regulatory framework that will facilitate provision of intra-group financial support in the EU by enhancing clarity of procedures and overcoming existing obstacles. Competent banking authorities across the EU will grant authorisation for support on the basis of a number of conditions: the interest of the group as a whole and the risks which would materialise for the providing entity if the support was not provided; the expected success of the support, the terms of the support (and various prudential requirements applying to the providing entity), as well as the possible impact on financial stability and the resolvability of the providing entity. \t\u00a0 \tThe present regulatory framework for intra-group financial support differs widely across the EU, in particular for those cases of subsidiaries supporting parent companies (upstream support), making it difficult for banking groups operating in more than one EU member States (cross-border groups) to allocate and manage liquidity optimally during periods of financial distress. Uncertainties around conditions and resources for supporting the group entity in distress, as well as excessive regulatory constraints, can ultimately result in a destabilisation of the whole group. \t\u00a0 \tThe fulfilment of the conditions provided in these Standards and Guidelines must be assessed on the basis of the capital and liquidity situation of the concerned institution. Authorities across the EU will be required to conduct a risk analysis of the reasons for the financial distress of the institution concerned, as well as business models, current market situation and potential further adverse developments. Authorities are given flexibility to consider additional elements on a case-by-case basis. \t\u00a0 \tIn its ITS on the form and content of the disclosure of public support agreements, the EBA also specified the disclosure requirements for intra-group financial support. Ensuring greater transparency on support agreements in the EU banking sector allows creditors to make informed decisions and drives a better safeguard of the interests of investors and depositors in the supporting entity. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe Guidelines and draft RTS have been developed according to Article 23 of BRRD (Directive 2014/59/EU), which mandates the EBA to specify the conditions for the provision of group financial support. The draft ITS are based on Article 26 of the BRRD, which mandates the EBA to develop a draft specifying the format and content of the disclosure of group financial support agreements.

The proposed RTS illustrate the conditions, as well as financial stability considerations, that would ensure a harmonised approach in setting higher risk weights and higher minimum loss given default (LGD) values. The consultation runs until 6 October 2015. \t\u00a0 \tCapital requirements for mortgage exposures are harmonised across the EU, for institutions applying both the Standardised Approach (SA) and the Internal Models Based (IRB) approach. For institutions applying the SA, capital requirements for mortgage exposures are regulated through the fixed risk weights of 35% for residential real estate and 50% for commercial real estate. For institutions applying the IRB approach, capital requirements are constrained by minimum values for the exposure weighted average LGD, which is set at 10% for retail exposures secured by residential mortgages and 15% for retail exposures secured by commercial real estate. \t\u00a0 \tHowever, competent authorities may tighten the capital requirements of these mortgage exposures by setting higher risk weights (in the SA) or setting higher minimum LGD values (in the IRB approach). When competent authorities set higher risk weights or LGD values, they should comply with the proposed conditions specified in this consultation paper. \t\u00a0 \tThese conditions require among others that competent authorities specify the loss expectation or LGD expectation related to one or more property segments in their immovable property markets. Furthermore, the financial stability considerations stemming from the real estate market have to be specified and forward-looking immovable property market developments should be taken into account. The CP also consults on the appropriate level of indicative benchmarks for these loss expectations when setting higher risk weights. \tConsultation process \tComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

In this respect, these final draft RTS aim to ensure that eligibility to be an independent valuer is assessed in a consistent manner across the Union, thereby increasing legal certainty, enhancing confidence in the valuation process and ensuring a level playing field. In particular, the draft RTS set out general criteria under which a person can be deemed independent from both the resolution authority and the institution or entity subject to the valuation.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tBesides possessing the qualifications, experience, ability, knowledge and resources required to carry out the valuation effectively, the valuer must be legally separated from the relevant public authorities and the entity subject to the valuation and have no actual or potential material interests in common or in conflict with any relevant authority or the entity concered which could influence the valuer's judgement in carrying out the valuation. \t\u00a0 \tOnly two specific situations are identified by the final draft RTS as situations which preclude per se a person from being the independent valuer: where the person is not separate from the any relevant public authority or the entity subject to valuation and where the person, in the year preceding the date on which that person's eligibility to act as independent valuer is assessed, has completed a statutory audit of the entity concerned. \t\u00a0 \tFurther to consultation feedback, the draft RTS have been refined to ensure an appropriate balance between the need for harmonisation of the process for assessing independence whilst at the same time ensuring that all matters relevant to the appointment of an independent valuer in a particular case (e.g. in terms of the expertise and experience needed) can be taken into account. \t\u00a0 \tLegal basis and next steps \tThese standards have been developed according to Article 36(14) of the BRRD, which mandates the EBA to draft RTS concerning the circumstances in which a person is to be considered independent from any public authority, including the resolution authority, and the relevant entity, and can therefore act as an independent valuer. \t\u00a0 \tThe draft RTS have been submitted to the European Commission for endorsement, following which they will be subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament and the Council before being published in the Official Journal of the European Union. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-technical-standards-on-independent-valuers"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1011", "date": "2015-07-04", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA Chairman dismisses rumours over haircuts to Greek deposits", "text": " \tAndrea Enria, Chairperson of the European Banking Authority (EBA), the EU institution that brings together the banking supervisors and regulators of the EU, said today in a statement: \"I am not aware of any plans to introduce haircuts to retail depositors of Greek banks, as reported in the media this morning.

These RTS also cover situations of disagreement, so as to ensure that transparency is given to decisions taken on individual basis and cooperation and interaction between resolution authorities continues also in such cases. The involvement of resolution authorities of third countries, both in resolution planning and in group resolution, is also foreseen by these RTS, which require EU resolution authorities to develop and specify a framework covering this third country resolution authorities' involvement. \tThe recent financial crises have shown that cross-border cooperation and coordination are vital for effective resolution of failing institutions within the EU banking sector.

The Guidelines define common procedures based on the assessment criteria laid down in the EU legislative framework(1)\u00a0that establishes how acquisitions and increases of qualifying holdings by natural or legal persons in financial institutions should be assessed. The Guidelines aim to harmonise supervisory practices in the financial sector across the EU and to provide more clarity to proposed acquirers on how they should notify the competent supervisory authorities. \t\u00a0 \tThe European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) jointly reviewed and updated the non-binding guidelines for the prudential assessment of acquisitions of qualifying holdings which had been developed in 2008 by the former three EU financial Committees (CEBS, CESR and CEIOPS). \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines develop further the assessment process defined in the EU legislative framework and harmonise across the EU the conditions under which the proposed acquirer of a qualifying holding in a financial institution is required to notify its decision to the competent authority that is responsible for the prudential supervision of the undertaking. \t\u00a0 \tA clear and transparent procedure is defined for the prudential assessment by the competent authorities. The document looks at ensuring that the acquirer readily knows what information will be required, in order to allow the competent authorities to assess the proposed acquisition in a complete and timely manner. \t\u00a0 \tDue to the increasing integration of financial markets and the frequent use of group structures that extend across the entire EU, a single acquisition may be subject to scrutiny in several Member States. For this reason, the work of the three ESAs applies the principle of maximum harmonisation of procedures initially set out by Directive 2007/44/EC and will also harmonise provisions in all three financial sectors in the EU (banking, investment and pensions/insurance). \tConsultation process \tComments to this consultation can be sent clicking on the \"send your comments\" button.

These RTS have been developed within the framework established by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and aim at harmonising at EU level the process and content of notifications, as well as the notice of suspension, to be followed when a banking institutions operating in the EU is failing or likely to fail. \tThe EBA's RTS on notification specify the process, as well as the information required, for EU competent authorities to notify when a banking institution under their supervision is failing or likely to fail. A consistent, transparent and reliable pan-EU framework, made of common standards for all Member States, is essential for EU competent authorities to make prompt and effective decisions, as well as for all parts affected by the resolution action to understand resolution procedures. \tThe work of the EBA is based on the prescriptions in the BRRD which define the scenarios for determining that a banking institution operating in the EU is failing or likely to fail. The responsibility to identify failing institutions primarily lies with the management body of the institution itself. This information must then be notified to the Competent Authority at national level, which in turn also alerts the concerned Resolution Authority. The BRRD also envisages that either the Competent or Resolution authority can independently initiate an assessment of failing or likely to fail. \tThe RTSs issued today define the process and content of a notification and summarise the effects of resolution actions, in particular with attention to the effects and implications it will have for retail customers. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe proposed draft RTS have been developed according to Article 82(3) of Directive 2014/59/EU (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive or BRRD), which mandates the EBA to develop technical standards in order to specify the procedures and contents relating to the notification referred to in Article 81(1), (2) and (3) and the notice of suspension referred to in Article 83.

Both standards provide further specification of essential elements to ensure the effectiveness of the resolution regime established by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). These standards are part of the EBA's major programme of work to implement the BRRD and address the problem of too-big-to-fail banks. \tThe first set of standards on MREL ensure that institutions have adequate loss absorbing capacity. To avoid institutions structuring their liabilities in a way that hampers the effectiveness of bail-in or other resolution tools, the BRRD requires institutions to meet a robust minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. Banks need to be resolvable without causing financial instability and without needing public money and a robust MREL is needed to ensure this is possible. \tIn order to cater for the diversity of institutions and business models across the EU, the MREL is not a fixed figure. Instead, it must be set by resolution authorities on a case-by-case basis for each institution to ensure it is sufficient to implement their resolution plans. However, for consistency, the BRRD lays down common criteria for resolution authorities to apply, which are further specified by the EBA technical standards.\u00a0 \tIn particular, the standards clarify how each institution's capital requirements should be linked to the amount of MREL needed to absorb losses and how, to the extent necessary and given the resolution plan for the institution, a firm should be recapitalised after resolution. Resolution authorities should, as a default, rely on supervisory assessments of the degree of loss that a bank needs to be able to absorb and the capital it needs to operate.\u00a0These features mean that banks which are simpler, less risky, and easier to resolve should expect to have lower MREL requirements. \tThe standards have been adjusted following consultation feedback to ensure they provide a clear framework for linking the MREL to capital requirements, including where some parts of capital buffer or Pillar 2 requirements are not relevant to the aims of MREL, and to clarify the treatment of contributions from Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS) to the cost of resolution. \u00a0They also provide for a more tailored approach for financial market infrastructure firms which are subject to the MREL requirements and for subsidiaries of groups. \tMREL shares the same goal as the FSB's TLAC proposals and also many of the most important design features. The EBA final draft standards on MREL aim to avoid creating obstacles for those EU resolution authorities with responsibility for Globally Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs) and seek to apply MREL in a way which is compatible with the FSB's TLAC proposal. The EBA is closely monitoring the FSB's work to finalise the TLAC standard and is required to prepare a report on the consistency between MREL and international standards by October 2016. The EBA also expects to publish further analysis of European banks' current MREL positions in due course. \tThe second set of standards aims to ensure the cross-border effectiveness of the bail-in power. \u00a0Where liabilities within the scope of the write-down and conversion powers are governed by the law of a third country, including any such liabilities forming part of MREL, the BRRD requires agreements concerning such liabilities to include a contractual recognition term.\u00a0 This is a contractual term by which the creditor (or party to the agreement creating the liability) acknowledges the liability may be subject to these powers and agrees to be bound by any reduction of the principal or outstanding amount due, conversion or cancellation that is affected by the exercise of the powers by an EU resolution authority. \tThe final draft RTS further determine the cases in which the requirement to include the contractual term does not apply. In particular, the requirement is displaced where an adequate statutory regime in the relevant third country or an international agreement exists which provides for an administrative or judicial procedure to secure recognition of the application of the write-down and conversion powers by an EU resolution authority. \tIn addition, further to consultation feedback, the final draft RTS also specify that liabilities that are fully secured in accordance with EU regulatory requirements or equivalent third country law need not include the contractual term. \tImportantly, the final draft RTS specify the minimum contents of the contractual term. The EBA's approach is designed to strike a balance between the need for harmonisation and the need for flexibility to take account of any issues arising in relation to a specific third country law, type of liability or arbitrage risk. Legal basis \tThese final draft RTS on MREL have been developed according to Article 45 of the BRRD, which mandates the EBA to further specify the MREL criteria. \tThe final draft RTS on contractual recognition have been developed according to \u00a0Article 55(3) of the BRRD, which requires the EBA to further determine the list of liabilities to which the exclusion in Article 55(1) of the BRRD applied, and the contents of the terms required in that paragraph, taking into account banks' different business models.

In particular, the EBA agrees with removing from its RTS the minimum 15% haircut to the value of the collateral posted by an institution with a central bank in order to obtain a credit line. It also supports the Commission's other proposed amendments, which provide added detail and further legal certainty on the necessary conditions for the application of the derogations. \t\u00a0 \tThe Commission had delayed its assessment of the EBA's final draft RTS as it was waiting to adopt its Delegated Act on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which does not include a minimum haircut requirement as a condition for allowing the use of credit lines committed by the relevant central bank as liquid assets (the so called derogation B). This has prompted the Commission to propose the removal of such requirement from the RTS. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA has, therefore, amended the RTS on the basis of the Commission's proposed amendments and resubmitted the RTS in the form of a formal Opinion. \tBackground and legal basis \tThe final draft RTS specifying the derogations concerning currencies with constraints on the availability of liquid assets have been developed in accordance with Article 419(5) of the CRR and were submitted to the Commission for endorsement on 27 March 2014.

The European Commission had requested in 2014 the EBA to advise on criteria for identifying a prudentially sound securitisation market and its regulatory treatment. The EBA, as one of the specialised EU agencies in banking and financial regulation, will deliver the opinion to the EC in early July and today's hearing is intended to give advance information of its findings to market participants. \tThe EBA advice on securitisation defines a series of criteria to identify simple standard and transparent term securitisation and asset-backed commercial paper transactions; one of the salient points is that capital charges foreseen by the 2014 Basel securitisation framework can be lowered for on qualifying securitisations to reflect their relative lower riskiness. The EBA opinion specifies the conditions under which transactions could qualify for a differentiated treatment within this new international framework. \tPresenting the findings at the hearing, Andrea Enria, Chairperson of the EBA explain that \"the EBA fully supports a review of the regulatory securitisation framework, which would also be important in the light of the Commission's effort to create a Capital Markets Union\" and added: \"We hope and believe that our report will feed into this discussion\". \tThe EBA explained that a qualifying securitisation framework in the EU should drive the development of a securitisation market that is sustainable and provides both issuers and investors with a more risk-sensitive regulatory treatment. While these are seen as the conditions to widen long-term funding opportunities for the EU economy, the EBA also reminded that regulatory capital should be maintained well within the prudential perimeter foreseen by the new international standards.

The report, which covers all the products that fall into the EBA's consumer protection mandate, such as mortgages, personal loans, deposits, payment accounts, payment services and electronic money, highlights the trends the EBA has observed with these products in 2015 and the issues that may arise, or have arisen, for consumers buying them. It also provides early indications as to the areas in which the EBA may take action going forward. In addition, the report summarises all the measures the EBA has taken to address these issues.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn 2015, the EBA identified eight relevant trends that may be the basis for potential future work in the area of consumer protection. Of these eight trends, six remain since last year's report, namely: household indebtedness, with a specific focus on mortgages; transparency and comparability of banking fees; innovation in payments; structured deposits; commercial selling practices and remuneration, in particular, as a key causal driver of mis-selling; and alternative financial services providers. For the first time, the report highlighted two trends, such as the use of banking consumer data, which is increasingly used by financial and other institutions to generate additional revenue; and negative interest rates and its effects on consumer contracts, both on deposits and loans. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA has already started to address some of these trends, and will use the findings of the report as input when developing and publishing its work programme for 2016, later this year. \t\u00a0 \tThe report also summarises how the EBA has addressed the issues identified in last year's report. The measures taken include one Regulatory Technical Standard on the minimum amount of professional indemnity insurance, two Guidelines on provisional lists of most representative services linked to a payment account and on security of internet payments, three consultation papers on draft guidelines on creditworthiness assessments, on arrears and foreclosure, and on product oversight and governance, and two opinions on virtual currencies and on lending-base crowdfunding. \u00a0 \u00a0 \tBackground and legal basis \tThe EBA resorted to a number of different sources for data and information when identifying trends for 2015.

The EBA agrees with removing from its ITS the Danish Krone (DKK) as a currency for which there are insufficient liquid assets and supports the amendments to the recitals that justify why the Norwegian Krone (NOK) still qualifies as a currency with such constraints. \tThe final draft ITS submitted by EBA on 27 March 2014 included the Danish Krone (DKK) and the Norwegian Krone (NOK) as currencies for which there were insufficient liquid assets. The analysis conducted by the EBA took into consideration the international standard on liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), published by the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision's (BCBS). The Commission, from its side,\u00a0 delayed its assessment of the EBA's final draft ITS\u00a0 as it was waiting to adopt its Delegated Act on LCR setting out rules on what assets can be considered as high quality liquid assets (HQLA). This Delegated Act, which deviates from the BCBS' standard, namely with regard to the HQLA definition, has prompted the Commission to seek advice from the EBA. \tThe EBA has, therefore, amended the ITS on the basis of the Commission's proposed changes and resubmitted the standard in the form of a formal Opinion. \tIn particular, in view of the treatment allowed for covered bonds in the Commission's Delegated Act, the EBA supports the Commission's proposal to remove from the ITS the DKK as a currency for which there are insufficient liquid assets. In addition, the EBA is of the opinion that the existing percentage derogation for the NOK should not be amended as it is not possible to carry out, within a short timeline and without causing further delays to the entry into force of the ITS, a new analysis to confirm the appropriate percentage, in particular due to the unavailability of detailed data on the impact of the changes introduced in the Delegated Act. However, the EBA intends to repeat, in the future, its analysis to update the list of currencies and their related shortages. Background and legal basis \tThe final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on currencies with constraints on the availability of liquid assets have been developed according to Article 419(4) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and were submitted to the Commission for endorsement on 27 March 2014. \tOn 11 May 2015, the Commission informed the EBA that in accordance with the procedure set out in the fourth and fifth subparagraphs of Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, it intended to amend the final draft ITS submitted by the EBA. \tOn 10 October 2014, the Commission adopted its Delegated Act on the LCR (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2051/61). \tThe EBA's competence to deliver an opinion is based on the fifth subparagraph of Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

Pooling financial resources into this common fund will be crucial for a successful implementation of the Banking Union. The EBA's technical advice will inform a delegated act to be adopted by the Commission on the initial period for the contributions to the Single Resolution Fund. \tThe key objective of this technical advice is to ensure that the Single Resolution Fund has sufficient means to credibly support resolution measures in the participating EU Member States. In this respect, the advice provides a number of recommendations on which safeguards should be in place to ensure that the target level of the Single Resolution Fund (at least 1% of the amount of covered deposits of all credit institutions authorised in all of the participating EU Member States) is achieved by the end of the initial period. This means by the end of eight years from 1 January 2016 or from the date on which this provision is applicable.\u00a0 \tWith this aim in view, contributions may, to the extent possible, exceptionally take into account pro-cyclical effects, and vary accordingly instead of being spread out evenly over the initial period. The EBA's technical advice recommends a number of indicators for determining the phase of the business cycle and the risk of pro-cyclical effects and specifies constraints for the variations of the contribution level. \tFinally, this advice also specifies the criteria for determining the contribution level after a significant amount of the fund has been used to support resolution measures and the Single Resolution Fund needs to be replenished. In this case, similar considerations as for the initial build-up of the fund apply. However, the process may be speeded up quite significantly to ensure that the target level is achieved as soon as possible. This may result in contributions of up to twice the amount of the contributions made in previous years. Legal basis and background \tThe idea behind the single resolution fund is that it would be financed by bank levies raised at national level and, as part of the Banking Union, it will gradually merge the national resolution funds across the EU Member States participating in the Single Resolution Mechanism. \tArticle 69 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 establishes uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund (SRMR).

In addition, these draft RTS outline the criteria for the eligible collateral and establish the criteria to ensure that such collateral is sufficiently diversified and not subject to wrong-way risk. \tWith respect to the first consultation paper, the ESAs reviewed or clarified several aspects of the proposed rules. These include: the exchange of margins with third countries entities and the treatment of non-financial counterparties; the treatment of covered bonds swaps; the timing of margin exchanges; concentration limits for sovereign debt securities; the requirements on trading documentation; minimum credit quality of collateral; initial margin models; haircuts for foreign exchange (FX) mismatch; the treatment of cash collateral for initial margin; reviewed criteria on intragroup exemptions. \tFurthermore, following the amendments of the standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) in March 2015, these RTS include a revised phase-in for initial margin requirements and a new phase-in for variation margin. \tAll the responses to the first consultation paper were considered when developing this new version of the standards.

They ensure this methodology effectively captures banks' actual and potential operational risk, is reliable and robust in generating AMA regulatory capital requirements and is comparable across institutions. \t\u00a0 \tIn addition, these RTS provide common standards for the supervisory assessment of a bank's operational risk governance with respect to the role and responsibilities of the operational risk management function and the reporting system and establish criteria for the supervisory assessment of banks' data quality and IT systems, the requirements and terms for an institution to use its AMA in the running of its business (\u2018use test') and the terms and the scope of audit and internal validation of the AMA framework. \t\u00a0 \tFeedback received during the public consultation period has also been taken into account by the EBA when finalising these standards.

Both Guidelines will help ensure consistent application of the new funding mechanisms provided for in the new Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD). \t\u00a0 \tThe objective of the DGSD is to increase the resilience of deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) and improve depositors' access to compensation. All DGSs in Europe will now have to be pre-financed by credit institutions. Depositors will be compensated quicker and in case of failure at a branch of a bank established in a different Member State, will benefit from the assistance of their own local DGS acting as a one-stop-shop. \tThe EBA Guidelines on risk-based contributions set forward methods for calculating ex-ante contributions to DGSs that are adjusted to the risk profile of each credit institution, thus promoting risk discipline and addressing moral hazard. \t\u00a0 \tUnder these Guidelines, calculation methods will include a set of core indicators capturing the main dimensions of the risk profile of credit institutions. Obligatory indicators will thus cover aspects such as capital, liquidity, asset quality, business model and asset encumbrance. These obligatory indicators will represent 75% of the risk assessment, thus leaving some framed flexibility to the DGSs and designated authorities to determine the remaining 25%. This flexibility will allow DGSs and designated authorities to take into account the specificities of credit institutions, while respecting a number of safeguards so as to ensure harmonisation and comparability across the Single Market. \t\u00a0 \tIn line with the DGSD, the Guidelines on payment commitments further specify the option for DGSs to authorise credit institutions to contribute, up to 30% of the required contributions, in the form of secured commitments to pay upon request. \t\u00a0 \tUnder these Guidelines, credit institutions will be able to make payment commitments by concluding two types of arrangements: a Payment Commitment Arrangement formalising the commitment, the amount and the rights of the DGS to claim the funds; and a Financial Collateral Arrangement, fully compliant with EU law on financial collateralisation, which ensures that the DGS access to funding is properly guaranteed by low risk assets that can be quickly mobilised in case the institution does not meet its commitment. \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines provide for criteria on the eligibility and management of collateral. Assets will be eligible for collateral only if they are of sufficiently low risk. The Guidelines also provide that DGSs should limit their exposure to debt, whether public or private, the value of which is highly correlated to events where the DGS would have to use its funds, and therefore might have to call in the payment commitment. Collateral will be subject to regular marking to market and precautionary haircuts in order to cater for possible losses at the point of failure. \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines also introduce principles ensuring that the prudential treatment of payment commitments does not encourage procyclicality by incentivising payment commitments over cash contributions. Accordingly, unless payment commitments are fully reflected on balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, supervisory authorities should assess, within their supervisory review and evaluation process, the risks to which the capital and liquidity positions of a credit institution would be exposed should the DGS call this institution to pay its commitment in cash. In the latter case, supervisory authorities should seek to mitigate that risk by requiring additional capital or liquidity requirements. \tLegal basis and background\u00a0 \tThese Guidelines have been developed according to Articles 10(3) and 13(3) of the Directive 2014/49/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on deposit guarantee schemes (Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive -DGSD).

The EBA will do so by fulfilling mandates under the upcoming revised Payments Services Directive (PSD2) and the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR). It has also issued final Guidelines for the security of internet payments that are applicable from 1 August 2015. \t\u00a0 \tThe legislative framework for retail payments in the European Union (EU) has seen important developments in recent months, such as the advancements in the negotiations for the revised Payments Services Directive (PSD2) and the finalisation of the EU Regulation on Interchange Fees (IFR). The European Commission, Council and Parliament are currently in the final negotiation stages of the PSD2 and once the Directive is agreed upon, the EBA will approach the industry and other interested parties to gather their input at an early stage of the regulatory development process. \t\u00a0 \tThe PSD2 mandates for the EBA are expected to include requirements to improve operational and security requirements for payment services. The EBA will develop this work in close cooperation with the European Central Bank (ECB), through the Forum for the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay) that the ECB and the EBA are chairing jointly. \t\u00a0 \tAs the security requirements under the PSD2 are not expected to come into force until 2018/9, the EBA had issued, on 18 December 2014, its final Guidelines on the security of internet payments. The requirements are a response to increases in fraud that regulators have observed with this particular payment method. The Guidelines represent the first output of the cooperation between the EBA and ECB on retail payments; have taken two years to develop; are applicable as of 1 August 2015; and will apply until the PSD2 requirements come into force in 2018/9. \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines will set minimum security requirements for payment services providers across the EU, and will provide enhanced protection of EU consumers against payment fraud on the Internet. Dirk Haubrich, Head of the EBA's Consumer Protection, Financial Innovation and Payments Unit at the EBA explained that: \"This work will ensure increased confidence in internet payments for consumers and firms in the EU, and is aimed at allowing this sector of the payments market to continue to grow\". \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines are based on the \"comply or explain\" principle, which means that national authorities have to notify the EBA within two months of the publication of the translations whether they will comply with the Guidelines or otherwise explain their reason for non-compliance. The EBA published the translations on 5 March 2015 and has made today available a summary table of the compliance notifications received.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tWhile the Guidelines are a conversion of the requirements that had previously been developed by the SecuRe Pay Forum, the EBA also clarified that other initiatives that had been started by SecuRe Pay \u2013 such as SecuRe Pay's consultation on draft security requirements for mobile payments, or its early views on third party access to payment accounts \u2013 will not be converted into EBA Guidelines. Instead, SecuRe Pay will from now on provide input to the EBA and the ECB for the development of the security mandates under the PSD2, and will do so to the timelines foreseen by the PSD2. \t\u00a0 \tFinally, the EBA expects to start its work on Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) foreseen by the EU Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR). The EBA will develop requirements to ensure that payment card schemes and processing entities are independent from one another in terms of accounting, organisation and decision making processes. The industry's views on this mandate will also be sought at an early stage, as the EBA is planning to approach relevant market participants during summer 2015.

These Guidelines, which stem from the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), foster convergence on resolution matters by giving detailed guidance to EU Resolution Authorities on the circumstances they should assess when taking their resolution decisions. \tThe first two sets of Guidelines describe how constraints to resolution tools resulting from competition and transparency requirements should be interpreted; their aim is to ensure an efficient and consistent implementation of these tools across the EU. \tIn particular, the Guidelines on the \u2018sale of business tool' specify that Authorities may deviate from the standard marketing requirements for the sale of the business of an institution under resolution, if the failure of the institution represents a material threat to financial stability and there is a conflict between the effectiveness of the tool and the marketing requirements. The Guidelines provide a list of elements for Authorities to assess threats to financial stability and conflicts with marketing requirements. \tThe Guidelines on the \u2018asset separation tool' provide guidance on what assets may be transferred under the \u2018asset separation tool' to an asset management vehicle (\u2018bad bank'). The analysis of these assets should be carried out over three steps according to the Guidelines: assessing the market situation for the assets concerned, the impact that their liquidation may have on markets and the effects that may result on financial stability. \tThe third set of Guidelines, on \u2018necessary services', define a minimum list of necessary \u2018critical' services that Resolution Authorities may require from institutions under resolution (i.e. the purchaser after a sale of business, a bridge bank or the transferee after a transfer of assets). This list aims to be as comprehensive as possible in order to allow for the highest possible degree of harmonisation of practices across the EU. \tThese Guidelines take into account the Financial Stability Board (FSB) guidance on critical shared services and they reflect the recent international discussion and commitments of the G20 members for efficient resolutions. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe Guidelines have been developed according to Articles 39, 42 and 65 of the BRRD, which mandate the EBA to promote convergence of supervisory and resolution practices on the effectiveness of the sale of business tool, on the conditions for applying the asset separation tool and on the power to require the provision of services following a transfer under resolution. \tThese Guidelines are addressed to Competent Authorities and will apply from 1 August 2015.

These standards have been developed within the framework of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) which sets procedures for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions across the EU. The draft RTS provide EU resolution authorities with a methodology for the valuation of derivative liabilities of credit institutions placed under resolution and ensure that the discipline brought in by the new bail-in tool can effectively be extended to these liabilities too. The consultation will run until 13 August 2015. \t\u00a0 \tThe draft RTS provide resolution authorities with a series of tools to carry out a swift and objective valuation of derivative liabilities while avoiding discrepancies with the insolvency counterfactual which could lead to breach the non-creditor-worse-off principle. The approach applies a statutory valuation methodology based on the costs or gains that would be incurred by the counterparty in replacing the contract. Derivative counterparties will be given the opportunity to provide evidence of commercially reasonable replacement trades and to determine the close-out amount within a certain deadline; if no feedback is received, then resolution authorities will apply their valuation based on mid-market prices and bid-offer spreads. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA standards also specify that resolution authorities should establish the value of derivative liabilities at the date of close-out or when a price is available in the market for the contract or the underlying assets, which allows for a final valuation within a matter of days with maximum accuracy. As early terminations of derivatives may bring specific additional costs, the RTS further specify the circumstances in which resolution authorities might exempt contracts from close-out and bail-in where the application of the bail-in tool is likely to bring destruction in value exceeding the bail-in potential of the corresponding liabilities. \t\u00a0 \tThe standards take into account the specific regulatory framework applicable to centrally cleared derivatives, for which the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) has introduced rules and procedures for valuing derivatives in resolution. In very exceptional circumstances, resolution authorities will impose their own valuation where central counterparties (CCPs) do not deliver a close-out amount or do not apply default procedures within an agreed deadline. \t\u00a0 \tThe framework proposed in the EBA standards will allow resolution authorities and independent evaluators to effectively conduct a reliable valuation in a short timeframe.

The Report states that these recommendations should not be introduced in isolation and should take into account the already existing requirements for disclosure, due diligence and reporting for comparable instruments. \tThe main recommendations of the report are: \t\tdue diligence requirements should be harmonised within the EU; \t\tstandardised investor reports should reflect the dynamics of SFIs and be stored in a centralised public space; \t\tall type of investors should be empowered to effectively conduct their own stress tests; and \t\ta harmonised due diligence and disclosure framework should be complemented with \u00a0a comprehensive regime for supervision and enforcement. \tSteven Maijoor, Chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and current Chairman of the Joint Committee, said: \t\"The proper functioning of the market for securitisations would benefit from the proposed measures aimed at ensuring consistency regarding disclosure and due diligence requirements across existing EU legislation on Structured Finance Instruments. Implementation of these measures, supported by an appropriate supervision and enforcement framework, will contribute to restoring investor confidence in this sector while increasing its efficiency\". Main Recommendations \tFollowing a thorough analysis, the Joint Committee is of the opinion that the due diligence requirements should be harmonised across EU sectorial legislation with the common view that, irrespective of the type of investors, due diligence should be seen as a dynamic process which starts with the investment decision and ends when the SFI matures or is divested. In particular, the Joint Committee recommends that investors' due diligence requirements are reflected in the SFI disclosure requirements.\u00a0 \tIn addition, the report recommends that investor reports should be standardised and stored in a centralised public space. Measures should be implemented to help investors in conducting effective stress tests on all types of SFIs. An adequate level of transparency should be ensured irrespective of the place where the issuer, originator and sponsor are established and the nature of the SFIs. In order to avoid discrepancies, the Joint Committee also advises to review the use of different definitions and key terms across the relevant sectorial legislation. \tFinally, the report highlights the necessity of complementing a harmonised due diligence and disclosure framework with a comprehensive framework for supervision and enforcement regarding SFIs.

Overall, the report found that in the past six months, risks affecting the EU financial system have not changed in substance, but have further intensified. \tThe EU's economic performance improved slightly in early 2015, however the financial sector in general continues to be affected by a combination of factors such as low investment demand, economic uncertainty in the Eurozone and its neighbouring countries, a global economic slow-down and a low-interest rate environment. \tThe main risks affecting the financial system remain broadly unchanged from those identified in the report's previous edition, but have become more entrenched. The major risks include: \t\tLow growth, low inflation, volatile asset prices and their consequences for financial entities; \t\tSearch for yield behaviour exacerbated by potential rebounds; \t\tDeterioration in the conduct of business; and \t\tIncreased concern about IT risks and cyber-attacks. \tDespite these risks, a number of ongoing policy and regulatory initiatives are contributing to improving the stability and confidence in the financial system as well as facilitating additional funding channels to the real economy. These include ongoing regulatory reforms in the securities, banking and insurance sectors such as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and Regulation (MiFIR), the work on the implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRDIV/CRR), the work on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the Deposit-Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGS) and the Solvency II Directive, as well as the European Commission's plan for a Capital Markets Union (CMU). \tSteven Maijoor, Chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the current Chairman of the Joint Committee, said: \t\"The Joint Committee has noted some improvement in overall market conditions; however, the recovery is not yet sustained and is exposed to risks related to broad macroeconomic conditions, in particular the low interest environment and resulting search-for-yield behaviour. Additionally regulators continue to have concerns about the operational risks generated by some financial institutions' inappropriate business conduct, as well as those risks posed by inadequate management of IT risks. \t\"However, recent regulatory initiatives across the banking, insurance and securities sectors, such as the Comprehensive Assessment, the insurance sector stress test and Solvency II along with, the ongoing MiFID, EMIR and PRIPS reforms are contributing to improving the stability and confidence in the EU financial system. \t\u00a0 Key Risks Identified \tThe identified risks in the Report can be divided into macro risks to the EU financial system and economy and operational risks. Macro Risks \tThe key macro risks identified relate to: \t\tRisks from weak economic growth and low inflation environment, which include: \t\tAdverse effect that low interest rates and uncertainties about the economic recovery have had on the outlook for the financial industry; \t\tHigher valuation and market liquidity risk has raised concerns about the outlook for financial entities' stability in the event of reversals in interest rates and asset prices; \t\tLow profitability is motivating financial institutions and other investors to search for yield, which requires increased supervisory attention to the viability of business models, related restructuring activity and adequate management of risks. However, the promotion of sound and innovative business models for market-based funding structures could help to deliver additional stimulus; and \t\tSome continued doubts on the comparability and consistency of banks' calculations of risk weighted assets. \t\u00a0 Operational Risks \tThe key operational risks relate to: \t\tBusiness conduct risk remains a key concern with the Report recommending that supervisors should include misconduct costs in future stress tests where appropriate, while financial institutions should strengthening product oversight and governance frameworks. Further improvements in the regulatory framework and supervisory practices to address conduct risks are also warranted. In addition, further progress needs to be made on benchmark reforms where continuity and integrity remain a source of concern even if key panels remained stable; and \t\tIT operational risk and cyber risk remain of great concern and pose challenges to the the safety and integrity of financial institutions. IT risk increased due to costs pressures, outsourcing, the need for additional capacities and a mounting number of cyber-attacks. The adequate integration of IT risk into overall risk management is a key policy for mitigation. \t\u00a0 Notes to editors \tThe Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1st January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely and ensure consistency in their practices.

The report assesses how colleges have functioned during 2014 and identifies key activities for the effective oversight of EU cross border banking groups in 2015. The report introduces items for supervisory attention in 2015, including conduct risk, Information Technology (IT) risks and the need for effective decisions on recovery plans. \t\u00a0 Colleges bring together banking supervisors, from EU as well as non-EU areas, to jointly supervise those institutions that operate in more than one EU Member State. They have a key role in ensuring effective cooperation and the consistent pan-EU application of the Single Rulebook. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA's report notes that's advancements were made in 2014 in improving the efficiency of EU supervisory cooperation. In particular, colleges were important for effective coordination between national supervisors during the 2014 Asset Quality Review and the EU-wide stress test exercises.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn 2015, close monitoring of capital plans, as part of their regular risk assessments, will be vital as a follow up to last year's stress tests. This will ensure that EU banks preserve their strong capital positions and facilitate investigations of potential future weaknesses. In addition, supervisors will closely monitor credit risk management and undertake benchmarking of internal model outcomes. The activities of EU colleges of Supervisors in 2015 will also be marked by the new Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) which requires colleges to reach a joint decision on the assessment of recovery plans of cross-border groups. They will be supported in this process by the technical standards issued by the EBA. \t\u00a0 \tThe report also identifies the need for Supervisors to review conduct risk, and monitor and assess improvements in corporate governance of EU banks, so as to ensure sound ethical standards. IT risks will also feature on the 2015 agenda, as the vulnerability of outdated systems to cybercrime and outages was found to be on the increase in the course of 2014. \tNotes to the editors \tEnhanced cooperation between EU supervisory authorities strengthens the supervision of cross-border banking groups that operate both across more than one EU Member States and at a global level. Colleges of Supervisors are the vehicles for coordinating these supervisory activities. Under EU law (Article 51 and 116 CRD (Capital Requirements Directive 2013/36/EU)) colleges have to be established for European Economic Area (EEA) banks that have subsidiaries or significant branches in other EEA countries. \t\u00a0 \tAs part of its mandate to improve supervisory cooperation and convergence of supervisory practices, the EBA produces regular internal reviews on the functioning of Colleges.

Nonetheless, consistency in supervisory risk assessments and outcomes is important for the effective oversight of cross-border banking groups and to ensure a level playing field for banks across the single market.\u00a0 \tThe recently published EBA Guidelines on Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), along with technical standards on for example internal model assessments are designed to reduce divergences in practice. Nonetheless, implementation of these products in a consistent way will be important. To that end the EBA will provide training and use monitoring tools to assess implementation in its next report on supervisory convergence in 2016. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe EBA is entrusted, in its founding regulation, with developing a Single Rulebook and recommendations, along with a European supervisory handbook, to ensure there is supervisory convergence and consistency of supervisory outcomes within the Union.\u00a0 Moreover, Article\u00a0107 of Directive\u00a02013/36/EU includes a specific mandate for the EBA on consistency of supervisory reviews, evaluations and supervisory measures in Member States. This Article also requires the EBA to report to the EU Parliament and the Council on the degree of convergence of those supervisory practices. \tBased on this mandate, the EBA has collected information and analysed relevant supervisory practices and has engaged in a considerable development of regulatory products (Guidelines and Technical Standards), and promotion of convergence in supervision (participating in Colleges of Supervisors of cross-border institutions, developing a European Supervisory Handbook, providing dedicated training, conducting analytical and benchmarking activities).

The paper looks at the conditions that need to be met in terms of confidentiality requirements and gives an overview of equivalence to EU standards. This work aims to harmonise the application of Art. 116 (6) of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) in the composition of supervisory colleges. \tIn the Recommendation issued today, the EBA provided an indication of the equivalence of the confidentiality regime of certain non-EU countries to the EU confidentiality regime. The non-EU authorities were reviewed on the basis treatment of the notion of confidential information, professional secrecy requirements, restrictions on the use and disclosure of confidential information. The authorities included come from the following countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, China, FYR Macedonia, Mexico, Montenegro, Serbia, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey, and the USA. \tThe EBA looked specifically at ensuring that each non-EU authority is subject to a confidentiality regime equivalent to the one provided in the EU by the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). Equivalence of confidentiality regimes of third country supervisory authorities is key to ensure the safe and secure flow of information within that college. \u00a0Although the final decision on college membership is for each supervisor, promoting convergence amongst EU authorities is designed to eliminate inconsistencies in approaches, which could ultimately hamper the efficient and timely operation of the colleges of supervisors in the EU. \tNext steps \tFollowing the publication of the English version, the EBA will make available, in due course, the translations of these Recommendations in all EU languages. Within two months from the publication of the translated Recommendations, Competent Authorities shall confirm to the EBA their compliance status, which will be disclosed on the EBA website. The recommendations concern exclusively the assessment of the confidentiality regime of those third country supervisory authorities with a view to inform the relevant opinions, which CAs who are members of a college of supervisors, should express as referred to in Article 116 (6) of CRD; the Recommendation is not providing any form of guidance on the appropriateness of such participation as referred to in Article 116 (6): the latter issue remains to be determined by the college of supervisors alone taking into account the overall structure of the supervised group and the legislation applicable. \tLegal basis \tThe recommendations on the equivalence of confidentiality regimes were issued on the basis of Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 1093/2010 establishing the EBA.

The document lays out a qualitative approach for institutions to develop their internal policies for monitoring and setting appropriate limits, both at individual and aggregate levels.

The approach aims, first of all, at ensuring that institutions have sufficient information about their counterparties in the shadow banking sector, so they can make informed decisions about their exposures to the sector in general, as well as to individual shadow banking entities. \tThe Guidelines also cater for those institutions that lack sufficient level of information on their exposures to shadow banking or the capacity to use such information.

This edition of the risk dashboard is the first to have balance sheet information based on the supervisory reporting standards from FINREP, the Financial Reporting framework for financial institutions across the EU. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA dashboard confirms the positive trend of EU banks' capital positions, with the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio reaching 12.1 per cent in Q3 2014 (11.8 per cent in Q2). This is the highest level since 2009 and it was driven by an increase in retained earnings and capital issuances that outpaced a more modest growth of RWAs. The levels of non-performing loans remained stable, but still generally very high, despite divergences across banks, thus stressing the need for continuous monitoring of credit quality, accompanied by consistent transparency of banks' exposures. \t\u00a0 \tProfitability levels remain volatile and predominantly at low levels throughout the sector.

The Authority reminded that the purpose of the bail-in tool is to ensure the legislative principle that shareholders and creditors of a failing institution have to bear its losses, and as such exemptions should be applied cautiously. The EBA advice on critical functions is based on its work on rules for recovery planning and on a comparative analysis of the recovery plans of 27 European cross-border banking groups which identified key strengths and weaknesses in banks' approaches and is also published today. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA delivered today advice that will inform delegated acts on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). Upon request of the European Commission, the Authority provided a comprehensive set of criteria for testing critical functions of institutions under resolution, as well as core business lines of banks, the exclusion of liabilities from the application of the bail-in tool and on the deferral of ex-post contributions. \t\u00a0 \tThe substitutability of a function for the real economy, risk of contagion and loss of market confidence should be taken into consideration by national authorities, which should evaluate the potential impact that the resolution of an institution can have on financial markets and the real economy. Such analysis should be based on the analysis carried out by the concerned institution and complemented by a critical review by competent authorities and resolution authorities. This work is based on the EBA's work on rules for recovery planning and its \u2018Comparative report on the approach to determining critical functions and core business lines in recovery plans', which is also published today. This comparison report reviewed the range of practices currently observed across the EU banking sector and identified key strengths and weaknesses in banks' approaches for determining critical functions and core business lines in recovery plans. In particular the comparison exercise illustrated the preferred assessment criteria used by banks in their determination of critical functions and core business lines and most common set of indicators used to support the assessment. This comparison analysis should be beneficial to credit institutions in identifying best practices and their positioning in relation to peers, ultimately contributing to ensure that the approach to assessing critical functions and core business lines is correctly addressed in recovery plans.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn relation to bail-in exemptions, the EBA pointed out that the characteristics of an institution (e.g.: size, interconnectedness or complexity) should not automatically justify such exemptions. These should in fact be considered on a case-by-case basis, rather than by considering the specific nature of concerned institutions in isolation, as this could result in competitive unbalances and set wrong incentives for bank structures. The advice also recommends that exclusions should be used restrictively, as they are exceptions to the principle of equitable treatment of creditors of the same class and with a view to the no-creditor-worse-off principle the resources for absorbing losses despite exclusions are limited. The draft EBA RTS on the minimum requirement of eligible liabilities (MREL) requires authorities to take into account likely exclusions from bail-in when ensuring sufficient MREL. Where the resolution authorities have, when setting the MREL for an institution, assumed that certain liabilities would credibly and feasibly contribute to loss absorption, the advice recommends that this should be reflected in the conditions justifying an exclusion of these liabilities from bail-in. With regard to exclusions based on the impossibility to bail in a liability, the advice recommends to effectively constrain the use of this case. It should for example not be a ground for exclusion that a liability is issued under the law of a foreign country. Liabilities related to critical functions should be assessed on a case-by-case basis at the time of the resolution action. The advice also elaborates on liabilities required for risk management purposes. For the risk of contagion, the advice distinguishes two types of contagion (direct through counterparties of the firm or indirect by a general loss of confidence) and suggests criteria for each of them. \t\u00a0 \tRegarding the deferral of ex-post contributions to the \u2018resolution fund' provided by the BRRD and to which all EU institutions have to contribute, the EBA recommended that national authorities analyse the impact on solvency and liquidity of institutions before allowing for ex-post contributions, which should only be applied in exceptional cases. \tNote to the editors \tThe work issued today by the EBA is a response to a call for advice from the European Commission on drafting delegated acts in the context of resolution.

The opinion is addressed to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finansinspektionen) and follows their notification that they intend to implement a partial waiver on the eligibility of covered bonds in relation to risk weight preferential treatment. The verdict comes after a review of the Swedish covered bonds market and concerns the application of Article 129 (1) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). \t\u00a0 \tThe application of the Credit Quality Step (CQS) 1 requirement may create a potential significant concentration problem in Sweden. This is what the EBA said in its opinion sent today to the Scandinavian supervisor, Finansinspektionen, which had previously notified their intention to implement a partial waiver on the eligibility of covered bonds in relation to risk weight preferential treatment. \t\u00a0 \tAccording to current EU legislation, for covered bonds to be eligible for risk weight preferential treatment, their total exposure to institutions that qualify for CQS 1 must not exceed 15% of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing institution. This requirement may be partly waived by a Competent Authority, after consulting the EBA, if significant potential concentration problems in the Member States concerned can be documented. \t\u00a0 \tOn the basis of the evidence provided by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, the EBA concluded that a partial waiver is adequately justified. The partial waiver will allow for exposures to institutions that qualify for CQS 2 and will be applicable for up to 10% of the total exposure. To implement this waiver the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, which commits to reassess the need for continuing the use of the partial waiver on an annual basis, will amend its regulatory code.

These draft Guidelines set out the governance process for implementing sound remuneration policies across the EU, as well as the specific criteria for mapping all remuneration components into either fixed or variable pay. Guidance is also provided on the application of deferral arrangements and the pay-out instruments ensuring that variable remuneration is aligned with an institution's long-term risks and that any ex-post risk adjustments can be applied as appropriate. \t\u00a0 \tThese draft Guidelines complement the EBA Opinion on allowances issued in October 2014 by providing additional details in support of the principles formulated in it, so as to ensure compliance with the bonus cap introduced by the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV). In particular, the Guidelines clarify the process for identifying those categories of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the institutions' risk profile, and do so on the basis of the criteria that were defined in the EBA Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) on identified staff. \t\u00a0 \tSpecific guidance is provided on how the ratio between the variable and the fixed components of remuneration should be calculated, taking into account specific remuneration elements, such as allowances, sign-on bonus, retention bonus and severance pay. The document also covers pay-out processes and types of instruments used to pay variable remuneration, in line with the provisions defined in the EBA standards on classes of instruments and the combination of different categories of instruments. \t\u00a0 \tOn the application of proportionality to the remuneration principles, these draft Guidelines follow a legal reading of the CRD IV, supported by the European Commission, that the requirements on deferral and payment in instruments have to be applied to all institutions. On this point, the EBA is of the view that specific exemptions could be introduced for certain institutions that do not rely extensively on variable remuneration and, if confirmed by further analysis, also for identified staff that receive only a low amount of variable remuneration. \u00a0To this regard, the Authority intends to send its advice to the European Commission suggesting legislative amendments that would allow for a broader application of the proportionality principle and is, therefore, asking all interested parties to provide input on this aspect. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA Guidelines will apply to competent authorities across the EU, as well as to institutions on a solo and consolidated basis, including all subsidiaries which are not subject to the CRD IV framework.

Instead of a stress test, in 2015, the EBA will be running a transparency exercise in line with the one conducted in 2013, which will provide detailed data on EU banks' balance sheets and portfolios. This decision has been communicated to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. \tThe decision not to run an EU-wide stress test in 2015 was driven by an acknowledgement of the progress that EU-banks have made in strengthening their capital positions in response to the 2014 asset quality reviews and EU-wide stress test. Moreover, these efforts were preceded by several years of capital raising spurred by the EBA's 2011/12 recapitalisation exercise, which led EU banks to strengthen their capital positions by over EUR200bn and to start the 2014 exercise with a CET1 ratio of 11.5%.

This exercise, run in parallel with the one conducted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) at a global level, allows the gathering of aggregate results on capital and liquidity ratios- including liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR)- and leverage ratio (LR) for banks in the European Union (EU). \tThe exercise monitors the impact of the transposition of the Basel III requirements on EU banks. In particular, it monitors the impact of fully-implemented Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV / CRR) on capital and Risk Weighted Assets (RWA), and the impact of full implementation of the Basel III framework on liquidity ratios (LCR and NSFR) and leverage ratio (LR) using data as of June 2014 under a static balance sheet assumption. Results show that the Common Equity Tier\u00a01 capital ratio (CET1) of the largest internationally-active European banks (Group\u00a01 banks) would be on average 10.8% compared to a ratio of 11.7% under the current implementation of the regulation. None of the Group\u00a01 banks would face a CET1 capital shortfall to achieve the minimum requirement of 4.5%, while they would be short of EUR 2.8\u00a0billion to reach the 7.0% level (minimum CET1 of 4.5% + capital conservation buffer of 2.5%). The shortfall figure remains the same when the surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) is considered. \tFor Group 1 banks, the overall impact of fully-implemented CRD IV / CRR on the CET1 ratio is mostly attributed to changes in the definition of capital and to a lesser extent to the changes related to the calculation of RWA. \tAs for the LCR, results show that as of June 2014, the average LCR of Group\u00a01 banks would have been 113%. Approximately 82% of the total sample of banks would have already met the final 100% Basel III requirement to be reached by 2019. In addition, the exercise reveals a shortfall of liquid assets of EUR 115 billion for Group 1 banks. \tThe results for NSFR indicate that, as of June 2014, the average fully-implemented NSFR for Group 1 banks would have been 102% and 111% for Group 2 banks. The NSFR figures show that the need for more stable funding would amount to EUR 324 billion, approximately 1.3% of total assets of all banks participating in the exercise. \tFinally, the average fully-implemented leverage ratio (LR) would be 3.9% for Group 1 banks, assuming the joint compliance with the 6% Tier I capital requirement. The shortfall for Group 1 banks due to the implementation of the provisions relating to LR would be EUR 2.4 billion. \tNote to the editors \t\tA total of 148 EU banks participated in the exercise on a voluntary and confidential basis, of which 40 banks belong to Group 1 (with a Tier\u00a01 capital exceeding EUR 3 billion and internationally active) and 108 banks belong to Group\u00a02 (all other banks). \t\tUnless otherwise stated, the capital, liquidity and leverage ratios in the monitoring exercise report refer to the full implementation of the CRD IV / CRR - Basel III framework. \u00a0Moreover the current implementation of the CRD IV / CRR differs from the full implementation of the CRD IV / CRR due to a number of transitional arrangements. \t\tThe results of this study are not comparable to industry estimates, as they do not include assumptions regarding banks' future profitability, changes in capital or balance sheet composition, nor further management actions that could be taken in response to the new Basel framework. \t\tThe results of previous exercises in this series were published in September 2014, March 2014, September 2013, March 2013, September 2012 and April 2012.

The EBA opinion, which is addressed to the European Commission, the European Parliament and the EU Council, looked into lending-based crowdfunding across the EU, identified a series of risks and evaluated how they can be addressed in the EU legislative framework. \tAccording to the Authority, convergence for the supervision practices of crowdfunding across the EU is desirable not only to avoid regulatory arbitrage, but also to ensure a level-playing field for all participants across the EU Single Market. The EBA explained that in these early stages of the development of crowdfunding, regulatory convergence should be based on existing EU law, and recommended that EU legislators clarify its applicability. \tThe analysis of lending-based crowdfunding was carried out by the EBA in line with its mandate to monitor new and innovative forms of financial activities and with a view to determine the risks to participants in this market (i.e. lenders, borrowers and platform providers). The EBA specifically looked into the type of regulation that would be required in order to drive confidence in this new market segment. The opinion reviewed present business models in the sector and considered the extent to which the identified risks are already addressed in existing EU directives and regulations and national regulatory frameworks. \tAs a result, the EBA has identified the Payment Services Directive (Directive 2007/64/EC), which can cover payment-related aspects of crowdfunding activities, as the most readily applicable EU legislative text to lending-based crowdfunding. However, the Authority pointed out that since crowdfunding platforms would not typically fall within the perimeter of credit institutions, as they are defined under EU law, lending-related aspects are not covered by EU law. The EBA added that this situation leaves several lending-related risks unlikely to be addressed and gave a set of options to mitigate these. \tNote to the editors \tOne of the tasks of the EBA is to monitor new and existing financial activities and to adopt guidelines and recommendations with a view to promoting the safety and soundness of markets and convergence in regulatory practice.

The sixteen policy recommendations in the Opinion build on an extensive technical analysis conducted by the EBA, which is also published today in the form of a Report and a Review. Based on the findings of the Report, the Commission may adopt a delegated act. The CVA data collection exercise conducted by the EBA on a sample of 32 banks across 11 jurisdictions has highlighted the materiality of the CVA risks that are currently not covered by EU legislation due to some exemptions provided for in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). Overall, the EBA is of the opinion that EU exemptions on the application of CVA charges should be reconsidered or removed, since they leave potential risks uncaptured. However, the EBA also thinks that any action should be taken in this regard only after a Basel review of the CVA framework as part of the fundamental review of the trading book. In the meantime, however, the EBA is proposing policy recommendations that can be implemented in the short-term, which will provide clarification and convergence in the implementation of the current CVA framework in the EU. In addition, in order to partially address the risks generated by the current EU exemptions, the EBA recommends monitoring the impact of the transactions exempted from the CVA risk charge, and defining potential situations of excessive CVA risks, which could be taken into account as part of banks' Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). In this respect, the EBA will issue guidance specifying what may lead to a situation of excessive CVA risk, thus allowing competent authorities to decide whether or not supervisory measures should be taken depending on the specific situation of each institution. As supervisory measures cannot materially reverse the effect of exemptions that are enshrined in EU regulation, additional own funds requirements should never be calibrated in such a way to request capital requirements that replicate in full or in substantive part the international standards that have not been implemented into EU legislation. Over the course of 2015, the EBA will provide details in terms of process and timeline, as well as on the potential thresholds that could presumably lead to excessive CVA risks, which could be applied for the 2016 SREP process, at the earliest. Finally, in light of the Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP) for the European Union published on 5 December 2014 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and with a view to re-establishing international consistency in the implementation of the Basel CVA framework, the EBA is making policy recommendations aiming at addressing the inconsistencies of the current standards. In particular, the EBA recommends that the CVA risk charge should be re-aligned with actual CVA risk so as to better reflect banks' internal practices and ensure that a prudent capture of CVA risks does not generate unintended market distortions or wrong incentives for banks. Legal basis The report has been developed in accordance with Article 456(2) of the CRR, which mandates the EBA to monitor the own funds requirements for CVA risk and report on all aspects of the CVA framework.

Overall, this analysis points to improvements of EU banks' compliance with Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements and shows that the implementation of the LCR is not likely to have a negative impact on the stability of financial markets and of the supply of bank lending. The report is based on liquidity data provided by 322 European banks, covering about 2/3 of total banking assets in the EU, and it will inform EU policies aimed at strengthening the resilience of EU banks. \tOverall, the analysis carried out by the EBA shows that the general liquidity requirement is not likely to have a material detrimental impact on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets or on the economy and the stability of the supply of bank lending. To a large extent, this can be explained by the significant improvement, in terms of compliance, of EU banks with Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements; the potential for balance sheet adjustments to meet LCR requirements; the absence of supply constraints overall at country level due to redistribution of credit supply from non-compliant to compliant banks. \tThe EBA's analysis also concluded that the implementation of the envisaged Delegated Act by the EC will have a marked positive impact on the LCR of specialised credit institutions, such as factoring and leasing, auto and consumer credit banks and other specialised credit institutions which were identified in the EBA's first LCR IA report as being potentially detrimentally affected by the LCR. \tThis EBA analysis will serve as a basis for EU policy makers in their work on high quality securitisation in the EU banking sector, which, by ensuring banks have sufficient liquid assets, will ultimately strengthen their resilience.

These Guidelines, condensed into a single document, cover how institutions should apply the concepts of materiality, proprietary nature and confidentiality in relation to the disclosure requirements, as well as how they should assess the frequency of disclosures. These Guidelines aim at enhancing consistency in disclosure practices across the EU and are part of the EBA's work to ensure transparency in the EU banking sector. \t\u00a0 \tThese Guidelines provide for a common framework that promotes consistency and enhances transparency on the assessments of materiality, proprietary or confidential nature of information, as well as the frequency of disclosures. They have been finalised following a three-month consultation period that ended in September 2014. The new disclosure framework will improve market discipline and confidence, while remaining flexible enough to take into account the differences in business models of the various institutions across the EU. \t\u00a0 \tMore specifically, these Guidelines cover the process that institutions should follow and the criteria they should consider when assessing the use of any waiver of disclosure requirements related to materiality or to the proprietary or confidential nature of disclosures, as well as the frequency of their disclosure. These Guidelines also indicate what institutions should provide if such a disclosure waiver is used, as well as the key information that they should consider if they choose to disclose information more frequently than on an annual basis. This set of information to be disclosed was determined taking into account institutions' practices as well as the users' needs in terms of regulatory information. \t\u00a0 \tThe assessment of regulatory disclosures carried out by the EBA since 2009 has in fact shown that the concepts of materiality, proprietary information and confidentiality are implemented differently by institutions across the EU. While these differences may reflect normal divergences among institutions, meaningful and consistent information across the single market reinforces the confidence of stakeholders and market discipline in the EU banking sector. Similarly, a common set of more frequent information across institutions will enhance the consistency and comparability of interim regulatory information available to users.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThese Guidelines are in line with the work done at the international level to review regulatory disclosures by institutions. As for materiality, confidentiality and proprietary information, these Guidelines provide additional guidance compared to the work done at the international level.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThese Guidelines will apply six months after publication of the Guidelines in the official languages of the EU. \tLegal basis\u00a0 \tTo ensure market discipline (the ability of informed stakeholders to identify risks in financial institutions and to act in a way that signals those risks to other stakeholders), Part eight of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) specifies disclosure requirements that institutions have to comply with. These requirements cover all risk areas (own funds, credit risk, securitisation, market risk, operational risk) as well as information about risk management, exposures, RWA and capital requirements. Part eight of the CRR is the EU version of the Pillar 3 of the Basel II agreement, and disclosures provided in accordance with this Part (and before it in accordance with Annex XII of Directive 2006/48) are often referred to as Pillar 3 disclosures. \t\u00a0 \tThese Guidelines have been developed according to Articles 432 and 433 of the CRR, which mandate the EBA to develop guidelines on how institutions shall apply materiality, proprietary and confidentiality in relation to the disclosure requirements laid down in the CRR, and to develop Guidelines on institutions assessing more frequent disclosures of information required by Part Eight of the CRR.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-final-guidelines-on-disclosure-requirements-for-the-eu-banking-sector"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_1088", "date": "2014-12-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Joint Committee of the ESAs publishes final draft technical standards on risk concentration and intra-group transactions", "text": " The Joint Committee of the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs - EBA, ESMA and EIOPA) published today its joint final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on risk concentration and intra-group transactions under the Financial Conglomerates Directive (FICOD).

These RTS will be part of the Single Rulebook in the banking sector in the European Union (EU). \t\u00a0 \tWhen using the Internal-Ratings-Based approach (IRB) to estimate risk parameters such as the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the conversion factor (CF), institutions may ask Competent Authorities (CAs) to use shorter data series, namely data covering a period of minimum two years instead of the required five years. \t\u00a0 \tData waiver was initially permitted in the EU legal framework to promote the use of internal models. Following an impact assessment, the EBA concluded that most major EU financial institutions had already been using the IRB Approach for several years, and that there were likely to be only a few new data waiver requests arising from new IRB applications, hence making the data waiver less relevant. The EBA also concluded that using a shorter data history increases the uncertainty of risk parameter estimates and as then introduced specific conditions for the use of the data waiver, in order to limit the potential implications on the calculation of own funds requirements. \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the EBA is proposing to introduce some conditions that would exclude from the waiver low-default portfolios and limit its application to a small proportion of assets. In order to further mitigate the risks associated with shorter data series, the proposed RTS also highlight the importance of applying an appropriate margin of conservatism to parameter estimates, as well as ensuring an enhanced data vetting process. Finally, institutions should be able to prove that relevant datasets covering longer time series are not available if that is the case. \t\u00a0 \tThese RTS ensure the application of proportionality principles, as well as legal clarity.

The Opinion is based on a detailed report, which assesses compliance by Competent Authorities with securitisation risk retention, due diligence and disclosure requirements. \u00a0While expressing support for the provisions laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the EBA is making a series of recommendations to ensure increased transparency, legal certainty of compliance with the retention rules as well as prevention of any potential regulatory arbitrage. The report also assesses the application and effectiveness of such requirements in light of the international developments. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA has reviewed the supervisory measures taken by Competent Authorities to ensure compliance with securitisation risk retention, disclosure and due diligence requirements and has highlighted in its report that in most jurisdictions - at least in those countries with an active securitisation market - actions have been taken. The limited number of cases of breaches reported by Competent Authorities is a positive signal in this respect.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tFollowing a comprehensive analysis, the EBA is of the opinion that the retention requirements and its multiple components, namely the type of retainer (originator, original lender or sponsor), the forms of retention used, the level of net economic interest retained, and the assessment of the consolidated situation of the retainer, are appropriate, and recommends to introduce certain additional safeguards and provisions to support the current framework. \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the EBA recommends to implement a complementary \u2018direct' approach (where the onus is on the originator, sponsor or original lender) together with the existing \u2018indirect' approach (where the onus on the investors) aimed at creating more certainty and transparency for investors.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn addition, the report highlights that as a result of the wide scope of the definition of \u2018originator' in the CRR , securitisation transactions may be structured so as to meet the legal requirements of the regulation without, however, following the \u2018spirit' of the regulation. The EBA believes that the scope of the originator definition should be narrowed down to ensure that industry participants do not abuse the rules. \t\u00a0 \tFurthermore, the EBA advises that the disclosure requirements are appropriate and fit for purpose to ensure investor protection as well as financial stability and that the due diligence requirements are sufficient and proper.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tFinally, when comparing and reviewing the regulations at international level, the EBA observed several differences.

The report highlights that throughout 2014, European banks have continued to take advantage of favourable market conditions to raise capital in preparation for the asset quality reviews (AQR) and the 2014 EU-wide stress test. The average common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio for the largest European banks reached 11.8 % in June 2014, the highest level since 2009 and broadly in line with the largest US banks. The report informs that market sentiment and confidence is improving. However, it also warns that the signs of recovery remain modest and fragile and that weak macroeconomic conditions can further affect credit quality. The heavy debt overhang, the potential impact of conduct-related issues, and the sustainability of business models and profitability remain sources of concerns. \tThroughout 2014, European banks have continued to benefit from generally favourable market conditions to raise capital. Between January and September 2014 alone, the largest European banks raised EUR 53.6 billion of equity (EUR 39.2 billion net of repayments and buybacks) and EUR 39.1 billion of contingent convertible instruments (both additional Tier 1 and Tier 2), in preparation for the release of the results of the 2014 EU-wide stress test. The capital raised allowed banks to continue the repair of their balance sheets through front-loading impairments and additional provisioning. \tThe results of the 2014 EU-wide stress test, released on 26 October 2014, confirmed the progress of the EU banking sector and the overall resilience of the major banks to adverse shocks. However, the report also notes that there is no room for complacency and more needs to be done in order to meet incoming regulatory requirements and foster consistency of risk-weighted assets (RWAs). \tThe quality of banks' loan portfolios in general has not further deteriorated, but credit risk is still high. In the first half of 2014, the ratio of impaired and 90-day past due loans to total loans decreased slightly to 6.4 % from 6.8 % in December 2013. However, the share of banks with a coverage ratio below 25 % increased markedly from 13.2 % to 19.9 %. EU banks' income and profitability is still under significant pressure, which is unlikely to dissipate in 2015. The main drivers are asset quality deterioration and the balance sheet clean-up, as well as, litigation costs related with conduct and IT risk. The pressure on profitability, combined with modest growth outlook will continue to present a challenge for management in terms of sustainability of some banks' business models. The report also highlights geopolitical risks and potential distress in emerging countries like Russia and China. \tFinally, the report concludes with references to policy implications and to the need for supervisors to develop a coordinated analysis of banks' business models across the EU as well as to perform benchmarking work on the outcomes of banks' internal models.

Concerned about the increase in frauds related to internet payments, the EBA decided that the implementation of a more secure framework for internet payments across the EU was needed. These Guidelines are based on the technical work carried out by the European Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay). \t\u00a0 \tAmong various measures aimed at more efficient and secure internet payments across the EU, the EBA guidelines require in particular that Payment Service Providers (PSPs) carry out strong customer authentication in order to verify the customer identity before proceeding with an on-line payment, one of the key measures to prevent internet fraud, be it through banking services or internet card payments. These Guidelines, which are based on the technical work carried-out by SecuRe Pay -the voluntary cooperation forum reuniting central banks and supervisors of Payment Service Providers -, will be applicable to all PSPs across the EU in a consistent manner as of August 2015. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA decided to issue these Guidelines because of the rising levels of fraud observed in internet payments. Latest pan-EU figures showed that fraud on card internet payments alone caused \u20ac794 million of losses in 2012 (up by 21.2% from the previous year). A timely and consistent regulatory response was therefore needed while waiting for the revision of the Payment Services Directive which aims at creating a more secure, competitive and consumer-friendly rules for payments in the EU.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tGeoffroy Goffinet at the EBA Consumer Protection Unit explained that: \"the EBA guidelines on internet payments provide the legal basis for achieving a level playing field for all PSPs across the EU. Through this piece of work, the EBA looked into supporting the development of e-commerce across the EU, while ensuring proper protection of consumers.\" \t\u00a0 \tPSPs will also be required to provide assistance and guidance to their customers in relation to the secure use of internet payment services. In particular, they will have to initiate customer awareness programmes so as to ensure that their users understand risks and best practices in internet payments.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tRegarding consumer data protection, the Guidelines foresee that PSPs offering card payment services to e-merchants should encourage them not to store any sensitive payment data or require that they have the necessary measures in place to protect these data. PSPs should also carry out regular checks and if they become aware that an e-merchant handling sensitive payment data does not have the required security measures in place, they should take steps to enforce this as a contractual obligation or terminate the contract. \t\u00a0 \tAll competent authorities across the EU are expected to comply with these Guidelines by incorporating them into their supervisory practices and amending their legal framework or their supervisory processes accordingly. \t\u00a0 \tNote to the editors \tThese Guidelines will provide a solid legal basis for the security of internet payments across all EU Member States while the revised Payment Services Directive (known as PSD2) is finalised in coming years. A consultation on the implementation of these Guidelines was launched in October 2014. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA work on this topic results from a concerted effort with the European Central Bank (ECB) to increase the security of retail payments and was developed on the basis of the recommendations issued in January 2013 by the European Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay). SecuRe Pay was established in 2011 as a voluntary cooperation between supervisors of Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and overseers of payment systems and payment schemes/instruments within the EU/EEA with the aim of facilitating knowledge sharing and understanding of security of electronic payment services and instruments.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-issues-guidelines-to-strengthen-requirements-for-the-security-of-internet-payments-across-the-eu"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1100", "date": "2014-12-19", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes technical standards and guidelines on resolution planning", "text": " The EBA published today final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on resolution planning and final Guidelines on measures to reduce or remove impediments to resolvability. These are part of the EBA's work to promote a consistent and coherent approach to bank resolution across the European Union (EU) and specify contents of resolution plans for EU institutions, as well as the criteria for the resolvability assessment. Common EU standards in these areas are essential to facilitate effective cooperation and joint decisions between resolution authorities. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA technical standards on resolution planning and resolvability assessment identify eight categories of information that should be included in a resolution plan and set out both general and specific requirements to be included in each category to ensure the preferred resolution strategy is achieved. The RTS also detail the criteria for resolution authorities to assess resolvability and address any impediments to resolution, which may be related to the structure and operations of the bank, to the availability of financial resources, or to legal, cross-border or other issues. Resolution authorities should assess this both on the basis of a preferred resolution strategy and any variant strategies needed to address different scenarios. \t\u00a0 \tThe RTS requires resolution authorities to consider whether and how some liabilities are less likely to be subject to bail-in (or to share the burden of loss absorption and recapitalisation if another resolution tool is used). This is an important input into setting the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), as described in the EBA's consultation paper on the criteria for setting MREL (https://eba.europa.eu/-/eba-consults-on-criteria-for-determining-the-minimum-requirement-for-own-funds-and-eligible-liabilities-mrel-). \t\u00a0 \tThe RTS also recognise the need for proportionality, which is addressed through a staged assessment process, inherently less complex resolution plans for less complex institutions, and the possibility for Member States to apply simplified obligations to certain institutions. The EBA is currently consulting on Guidelines on the criteria for applying such simplified obligations (LINK HERE) (https://eba.europa.eu/-/eba-consults-on-the-eligibility-of-institutions-for-simplified-obligations-for-recovery-and-resolution-planning). \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines issued along the RTS further specify the circumstances under which resolution authorities can require measures to overcome obstacles to resolvability that might have been identified in the assessment and also specify the measures that can be taken to reduce or remove these impediments. \t\u00a0 \tThe BRRD envisages a dialogue between authorities and the institution: As a first step the institution or group is required to propose possible measures to address the impediments identified by the resolution authorities. Only if the proposed measures do not effectively reduce or remove the impediments, the resolution authorities will require alternative measures in the following step. The Guidelines require such measures to be both proportionate and necessary, ensuring that particularly intrusive measures are only applied where necessarily required to remove substantive impediments to resolvability. \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines do not prescribe or privilege certain business models or organisational structures, but allow for a case-by-case analysis of the impediments caused by the institution or group and of the best way to address them. The appropriate measure depends on the organisation and the business model of the institution and on its environment, as analysed by the resolution authority in the resolvability assessment with a view to the preferred resolution strategy. Variant strategies should be considered if the measures based on these variant strategies are compatible with the preferred resolution strategy. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-technical-standards-and-guidelines-on-resolution-planning"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_1101", "date": "2014-12-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA consults on procedures and contents of notifications under the recovery and resolution regime", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on notifications and notice of suspension.

The EBA is of the opinion that given the significant potential concentration problems in Denmark, the application of a partial waiver is adequately justified. \t\u00a0 \tFor covered bonds to be eligible for risk weight preferential treatment, their total exposure to institutions that qualify for credit quality step 1 (CQS1) must not exceed 15% of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing institution, as specified in Article 129(1)(c) of the CRR.

In the first step, on the basis of mandatory quantitative indicators (related to size, interconnectedness, relevance for the economy, complexity), competent authorities will obtain scores indicating the systemic importance of each bank. Banks scoring above a certain threshold (upper threshold) will have to be identified as O-SIIs, those scoring below a certain threshold (lower threshold) can never be identified as O-SIIs.\u00a0 \tIn the second step of the process, competent authorities can still qualify banks scoring between the lower and upper thresholds as O-SIIs, by using their supervisory judgment, but only on the basis of a closed list of optional indicators set forth in the Guidelines. To ensure a high level of transparency and comparability, competent authorities are required to publicly disclose the reasons why they make use of their supervisory judgment. \tFinally, to reduce the reporting burden for small institutions, competent authorities may decide to exclude very small institutions from the identification process, if they assess that they are unlikely to pose systemic threats to the domestic economy. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThese Guidelines have been developed in accordance with Article 131(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD IV), which mandates the EBA to issue guidelines specifying the criteria for the identification of institutions as systemically important either at Member State or Union level (O-SIIs).

This edition of the risk dashboard is the first to have own funds' positions and requirements data that is based on the supervisory reporting standards from COREP, the Common Reporting framework for financial institutions across the EU, and includes an annex on aggregate risk parameters that brings enhanced transparency on EU banks' and allows comparison across countries and geographical areas. \t\u00a0 \tData in this edition of the EBA dashboard confirms the positive trend in EU banks' capital positions, which reached the highest level since 2009 with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) at 11.8 per cent in Q2 2014. This increase was driven by capital issuances ahead of the stress test and asset quality review exercises. The levels of non-performing loans remained stable, but still at very high levels, prompting the need for thorough assessments of credit quality, accompanied by consistent transparency. \t\u00a0 \tProfitability levels have been volatile. Continually subdued, returns keep on being severely affected by the clean-up of some major banks' balance sheets, as well as by litigation costs.

The aim of these standards is to achieve an appropriate degree of convergence in how these criteria are interpreted and applied across the EU to ensure a level playing field. Institutions with similar risk profiles, resolvability and other characteristics in any Member State should have similar levels of MREL. The consultation runs until 27 February 2015. \t\u00a0 \tThe BRRD provides a common resolution regime in the European Union that allows resolution authorities to deal with failing institutions as well as ensuring cooperation between home and host countries. In the future, shareholders and creditors will have to internalise the burden of a bank's failure, thus minimising moral hazard and risks to taxpayers.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tTo avoid institutions structuring their liabilities in a way that hampers the effectiveness of bail-in or other resolution tools, the BRRD requires institutions to meet a robust minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). This is not a fixed figure imposed by legislation, but is to be set on a case-by-case basis by resolution authorities. To ensure consistency, the BRRD lays down common criteria for resolution authorities to apply and these technical standards further specify these minimum criteria.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe BRRD criteria require resolution authorities to consider matters which are also assessed for prudential regulatory purposes. These technical standards therefore clarify how the institution's capital requirements should be linked to the amount of MREL needed to absorb losses and, where necessary, recapitalise a firm after resolution. Resolution authorities should, as a default, rely on supervisory assessments for the degree of loss that a bank needs to be able to absorb and the capital it needs to operate.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tResolution authorities must set an MREL which is sufficient to implement the resolution plan. In particular, resolution plans may identify that it would be less feasible or credible to bail in certain liabilities, even if it is legally possible. In these cases, resolution authorities would need to either increase the MREL or take alternative measures (e.g. affecting the ranking of liabilities in insolvency). The draft RTS also consider the effect of Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) contributions to the cost of resolution.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tLastly, the draft RTS propose that for systemic institutions, resolution authorities should consider the potential need to be able to access the resolution financing arrangement if a resolution relying solely on the institution's own resources is not possible. The BRRD sets minimum burden-sharing requirements before the resolution fund can be accessed. \t\u00a0 \tThese RTS are compatible with the proposed FSB term sheet for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) for Globally Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). Where there are differences resulting from the nature of the EBA's mandate under the BRRD, as well as the fact that the BRRD MREL requirement applies to banks which are not G-SIBs, these differences do not prevent resolution authorities from implementing the MREL for G-SIBs consistently with the international framework. \tConsultation process\u00a0 \tComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

These two sets of Guidelines are part of a series of EBA regulatory mandates under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), which aim to ensure that the bail-in power is an effective way of absorbing losses and recapitalising banks in resolution, and that resolution authorities and other stakeholders have a clear understanding of the terms on which it should be applied.

The consultation will run until 10 February 2015.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tDevelopments in the markets for financial services in recent years have shown that failures in the conduct of financial institutions towards their customers can cause not only significant consumer detriment but also undermine market confidence, financial stability and the integrity of the financial system. In addition, conduct failure can result in direct costs for financial institutions, as a result of redress and compensation pay-outs, penalties, fines, and loss of income. \t\u00a0 \tTo address some of the causal drivers of conduct failure, and following the initial work carried out by the Joint Committee of the three European Supervisory Authorities in 2013, the EBA has developed detailed Guidelines for the product oversight and governance of retail banking products, which are mortgages, loans, deposits, credit cards, payment services, payment accounts and electronic money.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines do not only address past failings but rather provide a framework for robust and responsible product design and distribution to avoid future cases of detriment.

These draft RTS aim to provide a common structure to decisions made by resolution authorities and independent valuers and to promote a consistent application of methodologies for such valuations across the EU. The consultation runs until 6 February 2015. \tThe Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) provides a comprehensive framework of powers for resolution authorities to intervene in failing banks to protect the public interest. To ensure that authorities exercise these powers in ways which reduce the risk of costs falling on the taxpayer, preserve value where possible, and respect the property rights of affected shareholders and creditors, the BRRD requires independent valuations to be carried out to inform decisions of the authorities. These valuations are required for several distinct purposes, either prior or after the resolution. \t\u00a0 \tPrior to resolution, valuations are required to (i) assess whether the conditions for resolution or the write-down or conversion of capital instruments are met and (ii) inform the choice on the resolution action to be adopted, the extent of any eventual write-down or conversion of capital instruments, and other decisions on the implementation of resolution tools. \t\u00a0 \tAfter the resolution, a valuation is required to determine whether an entity's shareholders and/or creditors would have received better treatment if the entity had entered into normal insolvency proceedings. \t\u00a0 \tThese draft RTS do not seek to provide detailed valuation rules for particular types of asset or liability, but to specify the principles on the basis of which independent valuers must apply their own information and expertise in particular cases. \t\u00a0 \tThe different purposes these valuations serve require different approaches to valuation, as recognised in the recitals and text of the BRRD. To assess whether the conditions for resolution are met, a valuation which is consistent with the framework of accounting and prudential rules is needed, but the valuer is required to apply their independent, sceptical judgement as to how this framework has been applied. For resolution decisions, valuation needs to assess economic value in order to ensure losses are fully recognised, even if this requires departures from accounting and prudential rules. This is needed to ensure that resolved institutions are recapitalised to a prudent extent and because certain resolution actions will in fact crystallise economic values. To determine compensation, a valuation conducted on a gone-concern basis is needed. \tConsultation process \tComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

These RTS support the effective application of the write-down and conversion powers in relation to liabilities governed by the law of a third country. The consultation is part of the EBA's work to promote the effective application of recovery and resolution powers to banks and banking groups with a cross-border presence and to foster convergence of practices between relevant authorities and institutions across the EU. The consultation runs until 5 February 2015. \t\u00a0 \tThe BRRD requires Member States to ensure that their resolution authorities have available powers to write-down and convert relevant liabilities of an institution at the point of non-viability and in the course of an application of the resolution tools. \t\u00a0 \tIn order to support the effective application of these powers in relation to liabilities governed by the law of a third country, the BRRD requires that agreements concerning relevant liabilities include a contractual term by which the creditor (or party to the agreement creating the liability) recognises that it may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers and agrees to be bound by any reduction of the principal or outstanding amount due, conversion or cancellation that is affected by the exercise of those powers by a Member State resolution authority. \t\u00a0 \tThe draft RTS developed by the EBA further determine the cases in which the requirement to include the contractual term does not apply. In particular the requirement to include a contractual term is displaced where a statutory regime in the third country concerned or an international agreement exists which provides for an administrative or judicial procedure to secure recognition of the application of the write-down and conversion powers by a Member State resolution authority. The draft RTS makes clear that a Member State resolution authority may only determine that a third country law or international agreement is sufficient to displace the obligation to include the contractual term where a minimum set of elements specified in the RTS is identified. \t\u00a0 \tThe draft RTS also specifies the contents of the contractual term required to be included in relevant liabilities where no alternative, i.e. statutory, mechanism exists to secure recognition. \u00a0This approach is designed to strike a balance between the need for harmonisation and the need for flexibility to take account of any issues arising in relation to a specific third country law, type of liability or arbitrage risk. \t\u00a0 \tThis Consultation Paper includes the EBA's proposal for the draft RTS and explains the approach the EBA has taken in relation to the proposal for the RTS. \t\u00a0 \tConsultation process \tComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

The EU Payment Accounts Directive requires the EBA to develop standardised terminology and information documents related to payment accounts for consumers across the EU. As a first step, the EBA has developed Guidelines to help Competent Authorities identify the most representative services linked to a payment account and subject to a fee in their jurisdictions. The consultation will run until 9 January 2015. The technical standards that will subsequently be developed will allow EU consumers to make better informed decisions when choosing their payment accounts. \t\u00a0 \tThe draft Guidelines published today by the EBA aim to assist Competent Authorities (CAs) across the EU in their task of identifying fee based services in payment accounts, as set out in the Payment Accounts Directive.

The consultation runs until 31 January 2015. \tThe CRR requires NSAs in the banking sector to set a materiality threshold that should help banking institutions to assess the materiality of their past due credit obligations, so that the occurrence of default can be defined in a harmonised manner across the EU. The parameters for CAs to set this threshold are to be defined by the EBA, which proposes in its draft RTS a series of conditions on both the structure and the application of the threshold. \tAccording to the EBA, a materiality threshold should be composed of an absolute and a relative threshold, where the first refers to the sum of all amounts owed by the obligor that are past due for a required number of days and the second is defined as the percentage of that sum in relation to the total credit obligations of that obligor. The EBA proposes that when either or both of those limits are breached a default would be considered to have occurred. \tThis work aims at harmonising the significant differences in how materiality thresholds are presently implemented across the EU, resulting in relevant operational burden for cross-border institutions dealing with different requirements from different national authorities. However, the EBA is aware that the changes it proposes might require relevant adjustments and time.

The proposed mappings establish the level of capital that financial institutions should hold in order to ensure the safety and soundness of the EU financial system. These draft mappings are based on the amount of objective information available for each ECAI regarding the performance of its credit ratings. Therefore, the draft mappings mainly reflect the historical ability of ECAIs to anticipate negative credit events. For those cases where only a small number of credit ratings were available, the draft mappings have to a large extent relied on alternative information; whereas, when no relevant information was found, a certain degree of prudence has been applied. \tFurthermore, the addendum contains some additional aspects resulting from the cost-benefit/impact assessment analysis. The analysis shows that the proposals for the largest ECAIs are not expected to have a significant impact on financial institutions in terms of capital requirements. Only in very specific cases the average capital requirement associated with a particular ECAI might increase by up to 10%. In the case of ECAIs that currently have no mapping established, the impact is expected to reflect the true risk profile of the rated entities. \tIn addition, the EBA also published the individual draft mapping reports that illustrate how the rules proposed in the draft ITS were applied.

The aim of the stress test is to assess the resilience of EU banks to adverse economic developments, so as to understand remaining vulnerabilities, complete the repair of the EU banking sector and increase confidence. On average, EU banks' common equity ratio (CET1) drops by 260 basis points, from 11.1% at the start of the exercise, after the asset quality reviews' (AQRs) adjustment, to 8.5% after the stress. By disclosing these results, the EBA is providing unparalleled transparency into EU banks' balance sheets, with up to 12,000 data points per bank, an essential step towards enhancing market discipline in the EU. \tIn preparation for the stress test, EU banks have made significant progress in strengthening their capital positions, as the starting CET1 ratio levels show. Between January and September 2014 alone, they have raised further EUR 53.6 bn of equity (EUR 39.2 bn net of repayments and buybacks) and 39.1 bn of contingent convertible instruments (both additional Tier 1 and Tier 2). \tThe 2014 EU-wide stress test results show an overall impact of the adverse macroeconomic scenario on the CET1 ratio of 260 basis points over 3 years, with CET1 decreasing from 11.1% in 2013 to 8.5% in 2016. The joint effect of the AQR and the stress test is 300 basis points. Over the three-year horizon of the exercise, 24 banks would fall below the 5.5% CET1 threshold and the overall shortfall would total EUR 24.6 bn. \tThe main drivers for this impact are credit risk losses, which account for 440 basis points of CET1 ratio decrease and an increase in total risk exposure (110 basis points). \tThe impact of the stress test on banks' capital positions is assessed taking into account the national transitional arrangements provided for in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRDIV) and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). However, to ensure consistency and comparability, the EBA is, for the first time, disclosing the impact of the stress test also on the future fully implemented CRDIV/CRR capital ratios.

EBA meanwhile publishes consultation paper on the security of internet payments, also based on the SecuRe Pay recommendations. \tThe European Banking Authority (EBA) and European Central Bank (ECB) are stepping up their cooperation to increase the security of retail payments. The two institutions have agreed to use as a basis for their cooperation, the technical work developed in the European Forum for the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay), a voluntary cooperative initiative between relevant authorities from the European Economic Area (EEA) that aims at facilitating knowledge and understanding of issues related to the security of electronic retail payment services. \tSecuRe Pay will work/function as a common basis for both the Eurosystem (the ECB plus the national central banks of the euro area) standards for the oversight of payment systems and retail payment instruments, and for the EBA's regulatory and supervisory requirements for payment services across the entire European Union (EU). The ECB and EBA have agreed to coordinate and further enhance their cooperation through SecuRe Pay, in light of the fact that the European System of Central Banks (which includes all EU central banks) is tasked with promoting the smooth operation of payment systems and that the regulation of payments services falls into the EBA's scope of action, with security-related mandates in the context of the revision to the EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2). \tAs a first step of this cooperation, the EBA has published today a consultation paper on draft EBA Guidelines on the security of internet payments, which are based on the SecuRe Pay recommendations. This strengthens the legal basis for the implementation of the harmonised oversight and supervisory policies on retail payments across the EU / EEA. In addition, any procedures and decisions taken by central banks in their oversight function for retail payment systems and payment instruments continue to apply. \tNote to the editors \tSecuRe Pay was established in 2011 as a voluntary cooperation between supervisors of payment service providers and overseers of payment systems and payment schemes/instruments within the EU/EEA with the aim to facilitate common knowledge and understanding of issues related to the security of electronic payment services and instruments and, where appropriate, to make recommendations. Since then, SecuRe Pay published a number of recommendations, including on the security of internet payments in January 2013. \tEBA and ECB remain equally committed to the objective of the Forum and the recommendations made until now.

These Guidelines are the first output of the joint work undertaken by the EBA and the European Central Bank (ECB) on the security of payment services. The consultation will run until 14 November 2014. \tThe draft Guidelines on the security of internet payments are based on the recommendations of the European Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay), a voluntary cooperative initiative set up by the ECB and comprising relevant authorities from the European Economic Area (EEA) with the aim of facilitating understanding of issues related to the security of electronic retail payment services. \tThe ECB had released its final SecuRe Pay recommendations for the security of internet payments in January 2013 with an implementation date for 1 February 2015. During a stock-take of the progress of its work in summer 2014, the SecuRe Pay forum concluded that a more solid legal basis would be beneficial to ensure consistent implementation by financial institutions across all EU Member States, as well as to reassure financial institutions that required investments and system changes are being followed up by a consistent regulatory framework.

The EBA also informs the two national authorities of the actions that they need to follow in order to comply with their obligations under EU legislation. \t\u00a0 \tIn the recommendation issued today, the EBA has formally requested that the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) ensures that depositors of Corporate Commercial Bank AD (KTB) and Commercial Bank Victoria EAD (VCB) have access to deposits protected under the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGS Directive) by 21 October 2014. \t\u00a0 \tThe Authority explained that after the formal investigation opened at the end of last month into the measures taken by the BNB in the conservatorship of the two banks, all the requirements for triggering the DGS Directive were found to have been met. This is the EU Directive prescribing that depositors should be compensated no later than 25 working days after the unavailability of deposits. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA told the BNB that it should either remove the limitations to access to deposits resulting from its supervisory actions in placing KTB and VBC in conservatorship, or it should immediately trigger pay-outs of due and verified claims by the Bulgarian Deposit Insurance Fund (BDIF). The EBA further clarified that if the BNB fails to take one of these two necessary actions, then the BDIF should pay out due and verified claims. \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the EBA expressed concern about the length of time that it is taking to establish the financial situation of both KTB and VCB and the impact that this is having on resolving the situation for depositors and other creditors in Bulgaria and beyond. The EBA asked that the BNB accelerate the ongoing audit process in order to provide certainty for depositors as rapidly as possible. \t\u00a0 \tNational authorities are required to take all appropriate measures to ensure the fulfilment of obligations under EU legislation and to interpret national law in light of EU legislation. The DGS Directive aims at ensuring depositor protection for deposits up to 100,000 EUR: where a competent authority has become aware that due and payable deposits are unavailable, it is required to determine within 5 working days whether there is any prospect of deposits being repaid or whether pay-outs by the national deposit guarantee schemes (DGS) need to be triggered. If the DGS is triggered, deposits should then be released within 20 working days. \tNote to the editors \tThe BNB placed KTB and VCB under conservatorship and suspended all payments on 20 and 22 June 2014 respectively. Both banks have been closed since then and during this period depositors have not had any access to their funds either through their banks or through the DGS. \t\u00a0 \tFollowing a stage of preliminary enquiries in September, the EBA had opened a formal investigation into an alleged breach of Union law by Bulgarian competent authorities: https://eba.europa.eu/-/eba-investigates-possible-breach-of-eu-law-in-bulgaria \t\u00a0 \tThe issuance of this Recommendation is a distinct procedure to the infringement proceedings launched on 25 September 2014 by the European Commission.

The report shows that some institutions have classified the so-called \u2018role-based' allowances in a way that increases the fixed component of remuneration, which may impact on the limitation of the bonus cap. As a result of this analysis, the EBA issued an Opinion to the European Commission and EU competent authorities calling for supervisors to ensure that institutions' remuneration practices on allowances comply with EU legislation. \tAccording to the EBA investigation, competent authorities across the 28 EU Member States have reported that 39 institutions use \u2018role-based' or \u2018market value' allowances, which the institutions classify as fixed remuneration. However, the EBA found that in most cases institutions had topped up the fixed remuneration of their staff and had introduced discretionary \u2018role based' allowances which have an impact on the limit of the ratio between variable and fixed remuneration required by the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV). \tThe report has been carried out within the framework of the EBA's market monitoring and assessment tasks and following a request by the European Commission to investigate the use of the so-called \u2018role-based' allowances, which were introduced after the EU's decision to limit the variable remuneration to 100% of the fixed component (200% with shareholders' approval). \tThe EBA explained that to be classified as fixed remuneration, these role-based allowances should have the following specific characteristics: be permanent, i.e. maintained over a period tied to the specific role and organisational responsibilities for which they are granted; pre-determined, in terms of conditions and amount; non-discretionary, non-revocable and transparent to staff. Whereas findings in the report showed that most of the allowances, which were the subject of the EBA investigation, did not fulfil the conditions for being classified as fixed remuneration, namely with respect to their discretionary nature, which allows institutions to adjust or withdraw them unilaterally, without any justification. \tThe Authority stated in an official opinion, based on the findings in the report and also published today, that if role-based allowances are discretionary, not predetermined, not transparent, not permanent, or revocable, they should not be considered as fixed remuneration but should be classified as variable in line with CRD IV. The EBA clarified that institutions making use of such allowances should change their remuneration policies and reclassify the ratio between the fixed and the variable component so as to comply with EU legislative requirements. Also, EU competent authorities that are aware of role-based allowances with the above characteristics being used in their jurisdictions are expected to take all the appropriate supervisory actions to reflect the findings of the EBA Opinion. They should ensure that these are correctly classified as variable remuneration, so as to make certain that institutions are not circumventing the bonus cap and other requirements laid down in the EU Capital Requirements Directive. \tNote to the editors \tEU competent authorities have until 31 December 2014 to use all necessary supervisory measures to ensure institutions review their remuneration policies so as to comply with the criteria highlighted in the EBA report and with the CRD IV requirements. \tThe EBA is currently revising its Guidelines on remuneration policies and practices, which will be consulted upon by the end of 2014 and finalised by the first half of next year.

With up to 12,000 data points per bank disclosed, it will provide an unmatched level of transparency into the EU banking sector. Simultaneously, the ECB will be publishing the results of its Comprehensive Assessment (CA). \tThe EBA announced today that detailed individual results for all banks participating in the EBA EU-wide stress test, along with detailed balance sheets and exposure data as of end 2013, will be published on Sunday 26 October 2014 at 12:00 Central European Time (11 GMT time). The results, as checked by competent authorities including the ECB, will cover up to 12,000 data points per bank across the entire EU and it will cover banks' composition of capital, risk weighted assets (RWAs), profit and loss (P&L), exposures to sovereigns, credit risk and securitisation.

These Technical Standards and Guidelines have been developed within the framework established by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and aim at strengthening integrated risk management by removing possible uncertainties around supporting entities in distress within the same group. The consultation runs until 4 January 2015. \tGroup financial support refers to one entity of a banking group providing support to another entity of the same group on the basis of a financial support agreement, provided the latter entity encounters financial difficulties and meets the conditions the BRRD requires for early intervention measures by the competent authority. \tThe legal framework for financial support within a group is widely different across the EU countries, in particular if the group is in financial difficulties and with regard to support from a subsidiary to a parent company (upstream support). This makes it difficult for cross border groups in financial distress to allocate and manage liquidity optimally, meaning that although the group as a whole has sufficient resources, individual entities may be at risk of failure. Therefore, uncertainties around conditions and resources for supporting the group entity in distress and excessive constraints can ultimately result in a destabilisation of the whole group. \tThe purpose of the proposed RTS and Guidelines is to establish a clear harmonised legal framework to facilitate group support and to enhance legal certainty by overcoming existing legal obstacles. They ensure that competent authorities of the providing entity grant the authorisation to the support on the basis of a number of conditions: the interest of the group as a whole and the risks which would materialise for the providing entity if the support was not provided; the expected success of the support, the terms of the support (and various prudential requirements applying to the providing entity), the possible impact on financial stability and the resolvability of the providing entity. \tMoreover, the draft RTS and Guidelines require authorities and institutions to consider the possible reasons for the financial distress of the institution concerned, including their business model, the current market situation and potential further adverse developments. Whether the above conditions are fulfilled must be assessed based on a description and a projection of the capital and liquidity situation, as well as the needs of the receiving entity, also on the basis of the information provided by the competent authority of the latter. \tIn the ITS on the form and content of the disclosure of public support agreements the EBA ensures a high standard of transparency with regard to support agreements. So creditors of the group are in the position to make informed investment decisions and assess the consequences of the agreement on individual subsidiaries and the group as a whole. \tA public hearing will then take place at the EBA premises on 8 December 2014 from 14:00 to 16:30 UK time. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe draft RTS and Guidelines have been developed according to Article 23 of BRRD (Directive 2014/59/EU), which mandates the EBA to specify the conditions for the provision of group financial support. The draft ITS are based on Article 26 of the BRRD, which mandates the EBA to specify the format and content of the disclosure of group financial support agreements.

This is the first of several EBA regulatory mandates under the BRRD which aim to ensure that bail-in power is an effective way of absorbing losses and recapitalising banks in resolution and that resolution authorities and other stakeholders have a clear understanding of the terms under which it should be applied. The consultation runs until 3 January 2015. \t\u00a0 \tThe BRRD specifies the sequence in which the power to write down or convert liabilities in resolution should be applied. This sequence provides that capital instruments, as defined in the CRR, should bear losses first, before other liabilities. The BRRD also includes a similar provision about the power to write down or convert capital instruments at the point of non-viability. \t\u00a0 \tThe draft Guidelines provide general guiding rules, based on the resolution principles established by Article 34 of the BRRD, which should be applied in cases where there is potential ambiguity about which category of the writedown sequence a particular instrument belongs to. The two guiding rules are that when applying the bail in tool or the conversion power, except where exclusions according to Article 38 BRRD are made, the resolution authority should treat capital instruments which rank equally in insolvency in the same way, whatever their other qualities; and that the resolution authority should apply the same treatment to instruments which are partially included in the calculation of own funds as to instruments which are fully included.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThese are applied to the particular cases of grandfathered Additional Tier 1 instruments and Tier 2 instruments which are only partially included in the calculation of own funds because they are subject to the amortisation regime of the CRR. \t\u00a0 \tThe EBA will, later this year, issue for consultation further draft Guidelines on the operation of the bail-in power, namely on the treatment of shareholders and rates of conversion from debt to equity.

These Guidelines are part of the EBA's work to promote a consistent and coherent approach to deposit guarantee schemes across the European Union (EU). The consultation runs until 2 January 2015. \t\u00a0 \tThe Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD) aims at ensuring a uniform level of protection for depositors throughout the EU and the same level of stability of Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGSs) through the harmonisation of the financing methods. DGSs are financed by institutions through ex-ante contributions, regardless of any failure and ex post contributions when the failure actually materialises and the advanced contributions are not sufficient. \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the DGSD allows institutions to honour up to 30% of their ex-ante contributions through payment commitments, provided the latter are fully collateralised by low risk assets unencumbered by third party rights and at the disposal of the DGS. \t\u00a0 \tIn line with the new EU framework on deposit insurance, the EBA has developed guidelines to ensure that payment commitments are technically sound and implemented in a consistent way across the Single Market. \t\u00a0 \tIn this regard, the proposed Guidelines lay down the requirements that will secure reliable funding for the DGS, notably a marking-to-market of the value of the collateral and the obligation for the institution to provide additional funding in case of deterioration. In addition, the Guidelines clarify the prudential treatment of payment commitments. In particular, within the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), competent authorities shall assess the risks to which the capital and liquidity positions of a credit institution would be exposed should the DGS call upon them to honour their commitment, which should be treated as a cash payment from a prudential point of view. \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines take account of the proportionality principle, which allows small institutions to adjust the requirements for diversification and low correlation with risks of the DGS pay-out, provided that its overall portfolio of collateral assets remains properly diversified. \tConsultation process \tComments to these consultations can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

The Guidelines define how EU authorities should assess whether an institution is eligible for simplified obligations. The EBA will monitor any divergence of approach in the application of simplified obligations and will report accordingly to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The papers launched for consultation today are part of the EBA's work to promote convergence of practices between competent and resolution authorities across the EU. These consultations run until 3 January 2015. \t\u00a0 \tAccording to the BRRD, when determining the nature of the obligations imposed in relation to recovery planning, resolution planning and resolvability assessments for institutions, competent and resolution authorities across the EU should take into consideration the impact that the failure and subsequent winding up of an institution under normal insolvency proceedings could have on financial markets, other institutions, funding conditions, as well as on the wider economy. For this purpose, the BRRD details a series of criteria against which institutions should be assessed: the nature of the institution's business, its shareholding structure, its legal form, its risk profile, size and legal status and its interconnectedness to other institutions or to the financial system in general. \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the draft Guidelines further specify the criteria laid down in the BRRD by establishing a mandatory set of indicators against which competent and resolution authorities should determine the impact of the failure of an institution and its winding up under normal insolvency proceedings and therefore its eligibility for simplified obligations. A list of optional indicators is also provided which, in addition to the mandatory indicators, may be taken into account in the assessment process.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe aim of the Guidelines is to promote a common EU framework for the application of simplified obligations, in line with the principle of proportionality. The work of the EBA also aims to facilitate cooperation among different EU authorities, in particular for those institutions and groups that have a cross-border presence i.e. operate in more than one EU Member State. \t\u00a0 \tThe Guidelines also clarify that Globally Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIFI) and Other Systemically Important Financial Institutions (O-SIFI) should not be subject to simplified obligations, since it is assumed that their failure would always be likely to have a significant negative effect. \t\u00a0 \tThe draft ITS launched for public consultation along with the Guidelines include a number of templates and definitions to be used by competent and resolution authorities for the identification and transmission of information to the EBA about the way they have assessed institutions against the criteria set out in the BRRD, including the mandatory indicators, and the nature of the simplified obligations applied to eligible institutions. These templates establish a common framework for reporting which will enable the EBA to identify accurately any divergences in the approach of different EU authorities and subsequently report on this to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.

The consultation runs until 22 December 2014. \t\u00a0 \tThese Guidelines aim at fostering convergent practices among Member States' resolution authorities by giving comprehensive guidance on which circumstances resolution authorities should assess when taking their decisions. \t\u00a0 \tThese Guidelines can be divided into two groups and will be consulted upon at two distinct stages. The first one includes the Guidelines on the sale of business tool and the Guidelines on the asset separation tool. Both relate to the implementation of resolution tools against constraints stemming from the EU competition and transparency rules in relation to state aids. They aim at balancing these constraints with the objective of an efficient resolution regime. \t\u00a0 \tMore specifically the Guidelines on the sale of business tool specify when authorities may deviate from certain marketing requirements for the sale of the business of an institution under resolution. They provide for the possibility of deviating from standard marketing requirements, if the failure of the institution represents a material threat to financial stability and there is a conflict between the effectiveness of the tool addressing such threat and the marketing requirements. The Guidelines contain a comprehensive list of elements to assess this threat and illustrate potential conflicts with each of the marketing requirements. The Guidelines on the asset separation tool give guidance on assets that may be transferred under the asset separation tool. They suggest three steps in this regard: an assessment of the market situation for the assets concerned, the impact that the liquidation may have on markets and financial stability. \t\u00a0 \tThe second public consultation is on the Guidelines on necessary services, which define a minimum list of necessary \u2018critical' services that the resolution authority may require from the institution under resolution (i.e. the purchaser after a sale of business, a bridge bank or the transferee after a transfer of assets).

The report identifies a number of risks to financial stability in the EU, including prolonged weak economic growth in an environment characterised by high indebtedness, intensified search for yield in a protracted low interest rate environment, and uncertainties in global emerging market economies. The report also highlights risks related to conduct of business and Information Technologies (IT). \tSince the previous publication in April 2014, the report brings into focus the fragile nature of the economic recovery within the EU, reflected in generally weak balance sheets, both at private and public level. One main concern is that the present benign market conditions may hide fragilities in a weak economic environment. In particular, the ESAs see further challenges in high indebtedness and low private sector credit growth and highlight the importance of continuing with structural reforms in order to improve competitiveness and to revive the lending channel. \tThe report says that while ongoing asset quality reviews and stress tests in the banking and insurance sector will present a clearer picture of asset quality and help improve the reliability of balance sheets of EU financial institutions, ongoing balance sheet repair and debt restructuring should remain a key priority going forward. \tIn relation to operational and business-conduct risks, the ESAs believe that detrimental business conduct by financial institutions, such as the mis-selling of financial products and benchmark manipulation, remains of substantial concern. \tAndrea Enria, Chairperson of the Joint Committee and the European Banking Authority (EBA) said: \"The Joint Committee has seen an improvement in overall market conditions, however this should not be taken for granted as a number of issues persist, including high indebtedness, low interest rates and geopolitical issues, which have the potential to undermine the recovery if not addressed.\" \tEnria continued: \"Another key area of concern is related to inappropriate behaviour and misconduct in the financial sector, which pose risks from both a consumer and financial stability perspective\". \tThe report also points at increasing concerns over new IT-related operational risks and cyber risks. Both market participants and competent authorities have increased efforts to address these, but in some cases further understanding and recognition by supervisors and institutions may be necessary. \tRegarding financing conditions, the sustained accommodative monetary policy and further measures taken by central banks were found to have contributed to improvements, although low interest rates resulted in pressure for insurers, pension funds and asset managers. In particular, the protracted nature of the low-interest-rate environment has intensified a search-for-yield behaviour from investors, thus exacerbating risks to asset valuations generated by the potential for a sudden reversal. \tFinally, the report highlights the risk that EU financial institutions may be affected by political and economic uncertainties in a number of global emerging market economies, with special reference to the potential geopolitical risks in Ukraine and Russia.

These Guidelines aim at promoting a consistent and coherent approach to bank resolution across the European Union and will be part of the EU Single Rulebook in the banking sector. \t\u00a0 \tThe Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) defines a harmonised regulatory framework for resolving institutions across the EU. It establishes that resolution should be primarily and almost exclusively financed by private resources, in order to avoid, as far as possible, resorting to taxpayers' funds when dealing with unsound or failing credit institutions and investment firms. \tThe Directive also defines a request for extraordinary public support, as an indicator that an institution is failing or likely to fail. However, such support will not necessarily trigger a resolution if certain exceptional elements and conditions are met.

Both Guidelines ensure continuum between the on-going supervision conducted by national authorities in line with the CRD, and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). They aim at promoting convergence of supervisory and resolution practices in relation to how resolution should be triggered and how to apply early intervention measures. The consultations run until 22 December 2014. \t\tThe new BRRD regulatory framework has introduced a common set of early intervention measures that complement existing supervisory powers and measures, established under the CRD and applied according to the EBA Guidelines for common procedures and methodologies for SREP. The Guidelines on triggers for early intervention issued today by the EBA are addressed to competent authorities and clarify the conditions for using early intervention measures foreseen by the BRRD. The triggers for early intervention are to a large extent based on the outcomes of the SREP, expressed both in terms of Overall SREP score and scores for individual SREP elements. The draft Guidelines also provide the possibility of triggering early intervention measures on the basis of significant events and material deterioration or anomalies in the key indicators monitored by the competent authorities, before they are fully reflected in the SREP scores. \t\tDetermining that an institution is failing or likely to fail is the necessary element to start any resolution process. This determination is made by the relevant competent authority, but Member States may grant this power to the relevant resolution authority too. In this regard, the draft Guidelines provide separate guidance for the competent authorities, where the determination is based primarily on the outcomes of the SREP assessment of the viability of an institution, and for the resolution authorities, where the determination is based on the objective elements specified in the Guidelines (which cover an institution's capital and liquidity position, as well as other requirements for continuing its authorisation). \t\tWhile respecting the functional and operational independence of competent and resolution authorities, the Guidelines aim to ensure consistency in the outcome of their assessment of whether an institution is failing or likely to fail. In particular, the core areas to be assessed (i.e. capital position, liquidity position and other requirements for continuing authorisation) are covered both in the objective elements for the resolution authorities and in the SREP assessment conducted by the competent authorities. The scope of the draft Guidelines on resolution triggers is expanded to provide guidance on the consultation, as well as information exchange between the competent authorities and resolution authorities in order to determine if an institution is failing or likely to fail. The goal is to enhance coordination of supervisory and resolution practices. \t\tThe Guidelines published for consultation complement the EBA Guidelines for common procedures and methodologies for SREP and together they form a set of supervisory guidance linking on-going supervision, early intervention and resolution.

This exercise, run in parallel with the one conducted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) at a global level, allows the gathering of aggregate results on capital, liquidity (liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR)) and leverage ratios for banks in the European Union (EU). \tThe exercise monitors the impact of the transposition of the Basel III requirements in the EU. In particular, it monitors the impact of fully-implemented CRDIV/CRR on capital and RWAs, and the impact of full implementation of the Basel III framework on liquidity (LCR and NSFR) and leverage ratios using data as of December 2013 under a static balance sheet assumption. Results show that the Common Equity Tier\u00a01 capital ratio (CET1) of the largest internationally-active European banks (Group\u00a01 banks) would be on average 10.1% compared to a ratio of 12.4% under the current regulation. Therefore, Group\u00a01 banks would face a CET1 capital shortfall of EUR 0.1\u00a0billion to achieve the minimum requirement of 4.5%, and of EUR 11.6\u00a0billion to reach the target level of 7.0% or the higher threshold set for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The latter capital shortfall would, therefore, be decreased by 68% (from EUR 36.3 billion to EUR 11.6 billion). \tFor Group 1 banks, the overall impact of fully-implemented CRDIV/CRR on the CET1 ratio is attributed to changes both in the definition of capital as well as in the calculation of RWAs. \tAs for the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), results show that as of December 2013, the average LCR of Group\u00a01 banks would have been 107.3%. More than 70% of the total sample of banks would have already met the final 100% Basel III requirement to be reached by 2019. In addition, the exercise reveals a shortfall of liquid assets of EUR 124.5 billion for Group 1 banks. \tThe results for Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) indicate that, as of December 2013, the average fully-implemented Basel III NSFR for Group 1 banks would have been 102% and 109% for Group 2 banks. The NSFR figures show that the need for more stable funding would amount to \u20ac473bn, approximately 2% of banks' total assets.\u00a0 \tFinally, the average fully-implemented Leverage Ratio (LR) would be 3.7% for Group 1 banks, assuming the joint compliance with the 6% Tier I capital requirement. The shortfall for Group 1 banks due to the implementation of the provisions relating to LR would be \u20ac22.1bn. \tNote to the editors \t\tA total of 151 EU banks participated in the exercise on a voluntary and confidential basis, of which 42 banks (with a Tier\u00a01 capital exceeding \u20ac3bn and internationally active) form Group 1 banks and 109 banks are within Group\u00a02 banks (all other banks). \t\tThe results of this study are not comparable to industry estimates, as they do not include assumptions regarding banks' future profitability, changes in capital or balance sheet composition, nor further management actions that could be taken in response to the new Basel framework. \t\tThe results of previous exercises in this series were published in March 2014, September 2013, March 2013, September 2012 and April 2012.

As part of enhancing regulatory harmonisation in the EU banking sector and facilitating cross-border supervision, uniform data formats are necessary to enable comparable data on credit institutions and investment firms across the EU. \t\u00a0 \tAlthough the EBA XBRL taxonomy was primarily developed for data transmission between competent authorities and the EBA, many authorities have been using it for the collection of supervisory reporting from the credit institutions and investment firms they supervise. In this respect, the taxonomy proposed by the EBA will lead to greater efficiency and convergence of supervisory practices across Members States. In addition, it will facilitate the supervisory process, allowing supervisors to identify and assess risks consistently across the EU and to compare EU banks in an effective manner. \t\u00a0 \tThis XBRL taxonomy has been developed using the final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) published on 30 July 2014.

In addition, ESMA highlighted specific risks posed to investors by contingent convertible instruments (CoCos). \t\u00a0 \tAs part of their mandates to protect investors, depositors and policyholders, EBA, ESMA and EIOPA have analysed the practices employed by some financial institutions to comply with the new EU capital rules and requirements. These practices concern institutions engaging in \u2018self-placement', i.e. placing with their clients financial instruments that they, or their group companies, have issued and that are eligible to comply with specific prudential requirements. The ESAs have stressed that these practices may breach some of the rules governing financial institutions and may result in significant consumer detriment. Institutions should not allow the pressure on their capitalisation needs to affect their compliance with EU requirements in terms of provision of services to consumers. \t\u00a0 \tIn particular, the Joint Committee noted that the loss bearing features of many self-placement products expose consumers to significant risks that do not exist for most other financial instruments, such as the risk of having to share losses (risk of bail-in). Furthermore, these products often lack fully harmonised structures, trigger points and loss absorption, making it difficult for consumers to compare them with other financial products and to fully comprehend what they are buying. \t\u00a0 \tThe Joint Committee reminded financial institutions across the EU about their responsibility to comply with rules governing conflicts of interest, remuneration, provision of advice and suitability and appropriateness of products. Respecting consumer needs and demands, as well as providing investors and customers with appropriate information, remains compulsory for financial institutions. \t\u00a0 \tFurthermore, ESMA issued a separate additional statement on potential risks associated with contingent convertible instruments (CoCos), a specific category of instruments issued by financial institutions to comply with their prudential requirements. CoCo structures are highly complex and are non-homogenous in terms of trigger levels, necessary capital buffer levels and loss absorption mechanisms. While they can play an important role in inhibiting risk transfer from debt holders to taxpayers, it is unclear as to whether consumers fully understand the potential risks and are capable of correctly factoring these into their decisions. \t\u00a0 \tAs investing in CoCos requires a sophisticated level of financial literacy and a high risk appetite, these may not be appropriate for retail investors and ESMA recommends that investors take into account the relevant risks before investing. \t\u00a0 \tThe full text of the Joint Committee's Reminder has been published on the websites of the EBA, EIOPA and ESMA. \tNote to editors \tThe European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) are collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs).

The consultation runs until 18 October 2014.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tThe draft Guidelines set forth common European criteria for the assessment of O-SIIs with the aim of striking the appropriate balance between a European framework ensuring a level playing field and comparability across the Union, on the one hand, and the need to take into consideration specificities of Member States' individual banking sectors, on the other. \t\u00a0 \tFor this purpose, the Guidelines envisage a two-step process for the identification of O-SIIs. In the first step, on the basis of mandatory quantitative indicators (related to size, interconnectedness, relevance for the economy, complexity), competent authorities will obtain scores indicating the systemic importance of each bank. Banks scoring above a certain threshold (upper threshold) will have to be identified as O-SIIs, those scoring below a certain threshold (lower threshold) can never be identified as O-SIIs.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tIn the second step of the process, competent authorities can still qualify banks scoring between the lower and upper thresholds as O-SIIs, by using their supervisory judgment, but only on the basis of a closed list of optional indicators set forth in the Guidelines. To ensure a high level of transparency and comparability, competent authorities are required to publicly disclose the reasons why they make use of their supervisory judgment. \t\u00a0 \tFinally, to reduce the reporting burden for small institutions, competent authorities may decide to exclude very small institutions from the identification process, if they assess that they are unlikely to pose systemic threats to the domestic economy. \tConsultation process \tComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

The final draft RTS are complemented by Guidelines providing the range of scenarios to be used when testing recovery plans. These standards and Guidelines aim to facilitate bank recovery on a cross-border basis and enhance financial stability by ensuring consistent high regulatory standards in this area and a level playing field across the EU. They will provide the common framework and language which are indispensable for effective joint assessment of recovery plans for cross-border groups and will form part of the European Single Rulebook in banking. \tThe BRRD requires banks to draw up recovery plans which set out measures they would adopt to restore long-term financial viability in case of severe distress. Competent authorities are required to assess these recovery plans, and to agree on joint decisions for the recovery plans of cross-border groups. \tThe first set of regulatory technical standards (RTS) specifies the information which institutions should include in their recovery plans, which is broken down into different sections: (i) the summary of the recovery plan; (ii) information on governance; (ii) a strategic analysis; (iv) a communication plan; and (v) a description of preparatory measures. The second set of RTS identifies the principles and criteria which supervisory authorities shall follow when assessing i) the completeness, ii) the quality and iii) the credibility of recovery plans. \tThe RTS are complemented by a set of Guidelines specifying the range of scenarios which institutions should consider to test the effectiveness and adequacy of the recovery options and indicators. The objective of recovery plans is not to forecast the factors that could prompt a crisis, but rather to assess institutions' resilience and their ability to react to a wide range of shocks. Therefore, scenarios of macroeconomic and financial distress need to be designed taking into account the specific characteristics of the bank involved, including its size and interconnectedness. These scenarios should include situations where the bank would be at risk of failing if recovery measures were not implemented in a timely manner. \tThe RTS and Guidelines recognise the need for proportionality, which is addressed through the possibility for less complex institutions to design less complex recovery plans and the possibility for Member States to \u00a0apply simplified obligations to certain institutions. Forthcoming EBA Guidelines will expand on the criteria laid down in the BRRD for applying simplified obligations. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThese Final draft RTS and Guidelines have been developed according to Articles 6(8) and 5(7) of Directive\u00a02014/59/EU (BRRD), which mandates the EBA to provide a consistent framework for assessing and designing institutions' recovery plans. \tThe RTS and the GL have been drafted taking into account the experience collected on the basis of the recommendation which the EBA issued in 2013 to spur the development of recovery plans for cross-border groups.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-final-draft-technical-standards-and-guidelines-on-recovery-plans"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_1179", "date": "2014-07-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The Joint Board of Appeal of the ESAs dismisses appeal by an Estonian company", "text": " The Joint Board of Appeal of the European Supervisory Authorities (the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority) published today its decision in an appeal brought by SV Capital O\u00dc, an Estonian company, against a decision of the EBA.

These Guidelines are part of the EBA's work to promote the consistent and coherent approach to bank resolution across the European Union. The consultation runs until 9 August 2014. \tOne of the overarching objectives of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) is to avoid, as far as possible, resorting to taxpayers' funds when dealing with unsound or failing credit institutions and investment firms. With this in mind, the BRRD sets out a harmonised regulatory framework for resolving institutions at EU level and establishes that resolution should be primarily and almost exclusively financed by private resources. \tThe need for extraordinary public support is identified by the BRRD as an indicator that an institution is failing or likely to fail. However, such support would not necessarily trigger resolution in exceptional cases where a specific list of elements and conditions set in the BRRD is met.

Both consultations run until 9 October 2014. \tBank resolution can be a complex process, and so robust and credible resolution strategies and plans are needed in advance. The proposed RTS specify the contents of resolution plans drawn up by resolution authorities for individual institutions and groups as well as the criteria on which the resolvability assessment should be based. Common European standards in these areas are essential to facilitate effective cooperation and joint decisions between resolution authorities. \tThe RTS identify eight categories of information which a resolution plan should contain, and set out both general and specific requirements to be included in each category to ensure the preferred resolution strategy is achieved. \tThe RTS also detail the criteria on which resolution authorities should base their assessment of the resolvability of an institution or group.\u00a0 For this assessment, the draft RTS propose a staged approach. First, resolution authorities should assess whether liquidation under normal insolvency procedures is feasible and credible. If this is not the case, they should identify a preferred resolution strategy, and then assess the feasibility and credibility of that strategy. The preferred resolution strategy may be identified either as a single-point-of-entry (SPE) \u2013 in which resolution powers are applied to the top of a group by a single national resolution authority - or \"multiple point of entry\" (MPE) - in which resolution tools are applied to different parts of the group by two or more resolution authorities acting in a coordinated way. The draft RTS propose criteria to enable the choice between these two options. \tThe draft RTS recognise the need for proportionality, which is addressed through the staged assessment process, through the inherently less complex resolution plans needed for less complex institutions, and through the possibility for Member States to apply simplified obligations to certain institutions. Forthcoming EBA Guidelines will expand on the criteria laid down in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) for applying simplified obligations. \tThe proposed draft Guidelines complement the EBA technical standards on resolution planning and resolvability assessment by setting out the circumstances under which resolution authorities can impose measures to overcome obstacles to resolvability identified by the assessment. \tMore specifically, in case resolution authorities in their resolvability assessment, identify substantive impediments to liquidation in normal insolvency proceedings or to the feasible and credible implementation of resolution powers, the BRRD calls for a removal of such impediments. The proposed Guidelines provide additional details to the list of measures that resolution authorities can take to reduce or remove these impediments as well as to the circumstances under which each of the measures may be applied. \tThe guidelines do not prescribe or privilege certain business models or organizational structures but allow for a case-by-case analysis of the impediments caused by the institution or group and of the best way to address them. \tConsultation process \tComments to these consultations can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

The taxonomy proposed by the EBA will lead to greater efficiency in and convergence of supervisory practices across Members States. The reference date is as of 30 September 2014 onwards and it includes the first reports under FINREP. \tThe taxonomy defines a representation for data collection under the reporting requirements related to own funds, financial information, losses stemming from lending collateralised by immovable property, large exposures, leverage ratio, liquidity ratios and asset encumbrance. As part of enhancing regulatory harmonisation in the EU banking sector and facilitating cross-border supervision, uniform data formats are necessary to enable comparable data on credit institutions and investment firms across the EU. \tAlthough the EBA XBRL taxonomy was primarily developed for data transmission between competent authorities and the EBA, many authorities have been using it for the collection of supervisory reporting from the credit institutions and investment firms they supervise.

The Guidelines include (i) requirements for originator institutions when engaging in securitisation transactions for SRT; (ii) requirements for competent authorities to assess transactions that claim SRT; (iii) requirements for competent authorities when assessing whether commensurate credit risk has been transferred to independent third parties; and finally (iv) a standard template on how competent authorities should provide information to EBA for approved transactions claiming SRT. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThese Guidelines have been developed in accordance with Article 243 or Article 244 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and are applicable for all transactions originated from the day of adoption of the Guidelines. \tThe EBA will provide advice to the European Commission by 31 December 2017 on whether a binding technical standard is required on SRT.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-final-guidelines-on-significant-credit-risk-transfer-for-securitisation-transactions"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1190", "date": "2014-07-04", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes final draft technical standards on conditions for assessing materiality of extensions and changes of internal approaches for market risk", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) specifying the conditions for assessing the materiality of extensions and changes of the Internal Models Approach (IMA) for market risk.

These draft RTS do not deal with institutions' exposures to central counterparties (CCPs). \tIn particular, these draft RTS specify the level of a particular parameter and the margin period of risk (MPOR) that clearing members may use to calculate the regulatory requirements for counterparty credit risk (CCR) when they apply the internal model method (IMM) or the other non-internal methods (i.e. the mark-to-market method, the standardised method and the original exposure method). \tIn the case of the IMM, the MPOR will be an input into the model, whereas for non-internal methods, the MPOR will determine a multiplier of the exposure value that is less than one.

The Opinion is also addressed to national supervisory authorities and advises to discourage financial institutions from buying, holding or selling virtual currencies while no regulatory regime is in place. \tFollowing a thorough assessment of virtual currencies carried out jointly with other European authorities, each within its relevant mandate, such as the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EBA has concluded that, while there are some potential benefits from virtual currencies, such as faster and cheaper transactions, as well as financial inclusion; however risks outweigh the benefits, which in the European Union remain less pronounced. \tThe EBA identified in particular more than 70 risks across several categories, including risks for users, market participants, risks related to financial integrity, such as money laundering and other financial crimes, and risks for existing payments in conventional (so-called fiat) currencies. The causes for these risks were also investigated by the EBA. These include for instance that a virtual currency scheme can be created -and its function subsequently changed- by anyone, and in the case of decentralised schemes, such as Bitcoins, by anyone with a sufficient share of computational power, and anonymously so. The EBA also added that individuals validating transactions (so-called miners) can also remain anonymous, and so can payers and payees; IT security cannot be guaranteed; and the financial viability of some market participants remains uncertain. \tBased on this assessment, the EBA is of the view that a regulatory approach to address these risks would require a substantial body of regulation, some components of which would need to be developed in more detail. In particular, a regulatory approach would need to cover governance requirements for several market participants, the segregation of client accounts, capital requirements and, most importantly, the creation of \u2018scheme governing authorities' accountable for the integrity of a particular virtual currency scheme and its key components, including its protocol and transaction ledger. \tHowever, considering that no such regime is in place as of now, some of the more pressing risks will need to be mitigated in other ways. As an immediate response, the EBA therefore advises national supervisory authorities to discourage credit institutions, payment institutions and e-money institutions from buying, holding, or selling virtual currencies. While this response will mitigate risks arising from the interaction between virtual currency schemes and regulated financial services, it will not address risks arising within, or between, virtual currencies schemes themselves. \tThis two-pronged approach will allow virtual currencies schemes to develop outside the financial services sector and will also allow financial institutions to maintain a current account relationship with businesses active in the field of virtual currencies. Note to editors \tOne of the statutory tasks of the EBA is to monitor new and existing financial activities and to adopt guidelines and recommendations with a view to promoting the safety and soundness of markets and convergence of regulatory practice. \tThe EBA started evaluating \u2018virtual currencies' in 2013 and issued a public warning on 13 December 2013 to make consumers aware that virtual currencies are not regulated and that risks, as a result, are unmitigated. \tIn the opinion issued today, the EBA has brought forward its assessment of virtual currencies by addressing whether virtual currencies should and can be regulated.

The Authority considers as appropriate not to deviate from the current prudential approach applied at the international level under the Basel III rules, i.e. full deduction of institutions' own credit risk of derivatives. The work of the EBA will inform the work of the EU Commission on the topic. \tThe measurement of own credit risk of derivatives (debit valuation adjustment - DVA) depends on several valuation inputs such as interest rates, an institution's own credit standing and other market factors that can affect the exposure value. The analysis of the EBA highlighted that at present it is challenging to measure own credit risk in a robust way. In addition, it is difficult to isolate in a consistent way the changes in own credit risk that are stemming only from changes in an institution's own credit standing. \tIn its advice, the EBA analyses different approaches of treating fair value gains and losses arising from institutions' own credit standing and concludes that it would be appropriate not to deviate from the Basel approach, i.e. full deduction of own credit risk adjustment from capital at inception. The Basel approach also ensures a conservative outcome and a level playing field at the international level and has the merit of addressing such a complex and ongoing issue in a rather simple way. \tThe prudential requirements could possibly be revised in the future, if necessary and if an agreement is reached on the current issues under debate. In the meantime, a close monitoring of institutions' practices related to own credit risk from derivatives seems appropriate, says the EBA. \tLegal basis and background \tThe EBA technical advice follows a call for advice from the European Commission aimed at assessing the appropriateness of the application of Article 33(1)(c) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), stating that that institutions shall not include in any element of own funds, fair value gains and losses on derivative liabilities of the institution that result from changes in the own credit standing of the institution. Taking into account the work of the EBA, the EU Commission will prepare a report on this issue that will be delivered to the European Parliament and the Council by 31 December 2014. \tDue to the limited time between the call for advice and its expected delivery date, the EBA took into consideration the current prudential treatment of own credit risk under Basel III, as well as existing best practices, industry analysis and the feedback received from a brief outreach to professional associations and some large institutions.

While expressing support for the current approach laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the EBA recommends additional criteria to qualify for preferential treatment. The opinion also calls for further clarifications on current disclosure requirements and provides advice on the preferential treatment of some specific cover assets. Finally, based on the analysis presented in the report, the EBA has identified a series of best practices ensuring a robust and consistent regulatory framework for covered bonds. \tThe EBA is of the opinion that the preferential risk-weight treatment that certain covered bonds receive across the EU in accordance with the CRR is appropriate, but it advises to strengthen the framework by introducing further qualifying criteria for their preferential treatment. \tIn particular, the Authority recommends that the additional qualifying conditions should cover minimum regulatory over-collateralisation, liquidity risk mitigation, and special public supervision. In addition, it advises that the disclosure requirements for preferential capital treatment currently foreseen in the CRR should be further clarified through the development of binding technical standards. \tFinally, the EBA has concluded that residential guaranteed loans should be maintained within the scope of the preferential risk-weight treatment. However, it recommends not to include aircraft liens in the scope and not to renew the derogation on the use of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs) as cover assets beyond December 2017. \tThe findings of the report are based on a review of national regulatory frameworks and supervisory practices on covered bonds in the EU, which identified substantial differences across the single market, as well as several areas where a common approach to covered bonds should be achieved. The review also evaluated main industry initiatives related to covered bond disclosure to investors. \tThrough this review, requested by the European Systemic Risk Board, the EBA also identified best practices for a robust common regulatory framework for covered bonds across the EU.

The report shows improvements in market sentiment and confidence which has allowed banks to increase their capital levels ahead of the 2014 EU-wide stress test and to continue the repair of their balance sheets. However, the report cautions about ongoing uncertainties on asset valuations and future profitability in an environment where the signs of recovery remain modest and fragile. The report also draws attention to looming redress costs related to conduct issues as well as to geo-political concerns in emerging markets, which could lead to risk aversion and to an impact on capital flows. \tThroughout the first half of 2014, the EU banking sector continued to observe improvements in market sentiment, both on the debt and equity side. European banks have been taking advantage of favourable market conditions by continuing to raise equity ahead of the 2014 EU-wide stress test. The capital raised is allowing banks to continue the repair of their balance sheets through front-loading impairments and additional provisioning without deteriorating the absolute levels of tier 1 capital. \tThe improvements on the banks' asset side were coupled with a deleveraging process, which so far continues in an orderly fashion and has led to a marked decrease of risk weighted assets, a shedding of risky assets and to a shrinking of balance sheets by EUR 3.4 trillion since 2011. The de-risking process is also helping banks to improve their capital ratios. \tHowever, the quality of some banks' loan portfolios has continued to decline and remains a concern, pointing to the need for rigorous asset quality reviews (AQR) with consistent definitions across the EU, as developed by the EBA. The ratio of impaired and past due (> 90 days) loans to total loans has increased and remains worryingly high. In some cases provisioning has not increased in conformity and an increasing dispersion is now being observed, with some banks decreasing their respective coverage ratio levels. \tIn addition, the heavy debt overhang in the public and private sectors and the necessary restructuring of the debt-burned corporate and households sectors may also pose significant challenges in maintaining adequate capital levels within the EU banking sector. Therefore, the ongoing repair of individual banks' balance sheets and sector restructuring should remain a key priority in the medium term. \tFinally, EU banks' income and profitability has continued to face significant headwinds and the looming redress costs related to conduct issues are a key concern. The deterioration in asset quality not only influences earnings and capital strength of the EU banks but also raises questions over near future economic performance. In addition, a number of detrimental business practices of some EU banks have crystallised and costs have increased markedly. Banks with a return on equity (RoE) of less than 4 % represented 39 % of total assets of the sample in December 2013. This, combined with the new regulatory environment, modest growth outlook and a low rate environment, will continue to present a challenge in terms of the sustainability of some banks' business models.

The report concluded that in most cases there may be limited volatility of own funds due to changes in the accounting and prudential requirements that derive from the revised IAS 19 Employee Benefits and the CRR. \tThe main drivers of the impact on the volatility of own funds were found to relate to internal factors, such as the existence of defined benefit plans, their characteristics and their size compared to the capital position of the institution, as well as to external factors, such as the evolution of macroeconomic variables to the institution. \tThe EBA also highlighted that during periods of downturn, own funds may be adversely impacted due to the increase of actuarial losses and therefore leading to an increase of defined benefit pension fund deficits. However, the EBA specified that it would be a prudent approach to fully recognise these losses on own funds, as this would immediately reflect the adverse impact on own funds rather than deferring it to future periods. \tThe EBA finally suggested that institutions with relevant defined benefit pension plans should carefully consider the possibility of losses arising from such plans and hence incorporate them in their capital planning. This shall allow institutions to secure sufficient capital to withstand losses that could originate from these plans. \tLegal basis and background \tThe Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) mandates EBA to prepare a report on whether the revised IAS\u00a019 Employee Benefits in conjunction with the deduction of net pension assets as set out in Article\u00a036(1)(e) and changes in net pension liabilities lead to undue volatility of institutions' own funds.

As part of delivering on this objective, and following the first Joint ESAs Consumer Protection Day last year in Paris, the ESAs organised the second Joint ESAs Consumer Protection Day on 4 June 2014 in London. \tThe event provided a platform to discuss consumer protection-related issues in the financial services area and gathered more than 300 participants from consumer representatives, academics, legal and financial consultants, national supervisors, experts from EU and national institutions and financial services industry (banking, securities, insurance and pensions). \tAndrea Enria, Chairman of the EBA and the current Joint Committee Chair, opened the sessions emphasising the importance of the clarity and strength of the legislation that defines the ESAs' tasks and instruments, including the resources that are assigned to the ESAs. Enria spoke about the first joint and cross-sectoral outputs on consumer protection and financial innovation delivered by the ESAs: such as the Joint Position on manufacturers' product oversight and governance processes, and the Guidelines on complaints handling which ensure a consistent approach to complaints handling across the banking, investment and insurance sectors in the EU. He also outlined upcoming areas of work for the Joint Committee on consumer protection, such as self-placement, cross-selling and Key Information Documents (KIDs) for investment products. Enria concluded his speech by highlighting the important role of consumer representatives, academics, providers of financial services, and supervisors and regulators in the work of the ESAs. \tThe three Chairs of the ESAs then attended a Panel discussion on product oversight and governance, to discuss the ESAs achievements in this area, as well as points that still remain to be addressed. Professor Roger McCormick from London School of Economics followed with a presentation on conduct costs and banking culture. \tVerena Ross, the Executive Director of ESMA, presented the work of the ESAs on cross-selling and outlined benefits and risks for consumers. Ross then focused on the practical guidance that regulators could offer to firms in order to better allow consumers to understand detailed information related to products and in general to improve consumers' protection in those cases where secondary or \u2018add-on' products are cross-sold with core products and where greater responsibility is placed on the customers themselves. The recommended options aim at further increasing consumer protection in the sector across the EU, so that they can take reasoned decisions. Such options include providing prominent and simplified price information and setting on-line default options, so that customers must actively \u2018opt-in' to purchase the secondary product rather than having the option already pre-selected. \tA panel discussion on Behavioural Finance explored some of the ways in which better understanding of consumers' behaviour has led to improvements in policy decisions. Panel members showed some practical examples, such as fine-tuning the language, tone and visual presentation used in correspondence, ensuring the right 'defaults' for products that have more than one option and banning pre-ticked boxes on internet pages. On the basis of these principles, the ESAs are developing a user-friendly Key Information Document (KID) for Packaged Retail and Insurance based Investment Products (PRIIPs), a good example of how behavioural insights are and will be used in practice to improve policy making. \tMembers of the Financial Innovation Panel presented their views on how to benefit from financial innovation, while controlling those risks that may cause harm to consumers and the financial system itself. Representatives of consumers, regulators and industry on the panel also discussed issues related to regulatory interventions on financial products and markets. \tFinally, Carlos Montalvo Rebuelta, the Executive Director of EIOPA, summarised the main discussion points of the event in his closing remarks and invited participants to attend the next Joint ESAs Consumer Protection Day on 3 June 2015 in Frankfurt. Notes for editors \tThe Joint Committee of the ESAs is a forum that was established on 1st January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely and ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analysis of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition to being a forum for cooperation, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).

These Guidelines have been merged into one single document and cover how institutions should apply materiality, proprietary and confidentiality in relation to the disclosure requirements, as well as how they should assess the frequency of their disclosures. This work will enhance consistency in disclosure practices across the EU and are part of the work of the EBA aimed at ensuring transparency in the EU banking sector. The consultation runs until 13 September 2014. \tThe Guidelines proposed by the EBA provide a common and flexible framework that promotes consistency and enhances transparency on the assessments of materiality, proprietary or confidential nature of information, as well as the frequency of disclosures. They have been drafted taking into consideration existing national provisions in EU member states, work from other fora and best disclosure practices. The new framework provided will improve market discipline and confidence, while taking into account differences in business models of the various institutions across the EU. \tMore specifically, the Guidelines cover the process that institutions should follow and the criteria they should consider when they assess the use of any waiver related to materiality or to the proprietary or confidential nature of disclosures, as well as the frequency of their disclosure. The Guidelines also indicate the information that should be provided if such a disclosure waiver is used or if an institution chooses to disclose information required by Part Eight of the CRR more frequently than on annual basis. \tThe assessment of regulatory disclosures carried out by the EBA since 2009 has in fact shown that the concepts of materiality, proprietary and confidentiality are implemented differently by institutions across the EU. While these differences reflect normal divergences among institutions, meaningful and consistent information across the single market reinforces the confidence of stakeholders and market discipline in the EU banking sector. \tConsultation process \tComments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

They cover all risk areas (own funds, credit risk, securitisation, market risk, operational risk) and provide information about risk management, exposures, RWA and capital requirements. Part Eight of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is the EU version of the Pillar 3 of the Basel II agreement, and disclosures provided in accordance with this Part (and before it in accordance with Annex XII of Directive 2006/48) are often referred to as Pillar 3 disclosures.

The report, based on data collected on a consolidated basis from 2010 to 2012, sets benchmarks for different aspects of remuneration policies, and provides additional insight into the previously published data on \"high earners\" (staff earning EUR one million or more per year). Overall, the report shows an increasing trend in the remuneration paid to \"risk takers\", as well as a material shift from variable to fixed remuneration. \tThe report highlights a huge dispersion between different institutions and EU Member States regarding the amounts of remuneration awarded; but also in terms of pay structure, application of specific risk alignment requirements, as well as percentage of \"risk takers\" (i.e. staff identified as having a material impact on banks' risks and businesses). \tIn particular, practices regarding the deferral of variable remuneration differ significantly across Member States, depending on the application of the proportionality principle, which allows small and less risky institutions to be exempt from the deferral of variable remuneration when such deferral is disproportionate to their specific risk profile or where only minor amounts of variable remuneration are paid. The EBA is currently investigating the different application of the proportionality principle across Member States and individual institutions. \tThe report also shows that institutions have been reviewing their remuneration policies to comply with the new requirements introduced by the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) and some firms have introduced so called \u2018position or role-based allowances'. In general, these allowances, which are paid as fixed amounts in addition to the base salary, are considered by institutions as fixed remuneration. However, these allowances are discretionary, as they are paid to selected members of staff and in most cases only for limited periods of time. Under exceptional circumstances, they can also be cancelled. \tThe EBA is currently analysing this emerging practice and will set guidance criteria to correctly assign these elements to either variable or fixed remuneration, so as to ensure that these practices do not lead to a circumvention of the newly introduced cap between the variable and fixed component of remuneration. \tLegal basis and next steps \tIn accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 (CRD IV), the European Banking Authority (EBA) is required to benchmark remuneration trends at Union level. The same requirement was already introduced by Directive 2006/48/EC as amended by Directive 2010/76/EU (CRD III). The report is in line with the \u2018EBA Guidelines on the Remuneration Benchmarking Exercise' published on 27 July 2012 to facilitate the collection of data. NCAs collect information on remuneration practices of credit institutions and investment firms to benchmark remuneration trends. These data are submitted to the EBA to benchmark remuneration practices and trends across the EU. \tThis analysis, together with other additional work in the area of remuneration, will be the basis for the review of the existing \"Guidelines on remuneration policies and practices\" which will ensure a higher level of harmonisation of remuneration practices.

The document aims to increase market confidence and for the benefit of consumers and firms alike it will ensure a harmonised approach to handling complaints for all 28 EU Member States and across all financial services sectors. \tThe final report published today is part of the efforts of the European Supervisory Authorities to bring further supervisory convergence across the securities and banking sectors. It was developed on the basis of the existing complaints-handling guidelines established by EIOPA (the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) for the insurance sector. The report was launched for a public consultation last year and this final version takes into consideration the feedback received. \tESMA and the EBA consider that these guidelines will ensure a consistent approach to complaints-handling across the EU. Consumers can purchase financial services and products in the investment, banking and insurance sectors across the entire EU Single Market and these guidelines will allow them to refer to a single set of complaints-handling arrangements. EU consumers will therefore be able to rely on the same approach irrespective of what type of product they have purchased and where they have purchased it. \tIn addition to strengthening consumer protection -a key statutory objective for ESMA and for the EBA-, the guidelines will also allow firms, some of which sell products from more than one sector across the EU, to streamline and standardise their own complaints-handling arrangements. National regulators too will be able to supervise the same harmonised requirements across all sectors of financial services in their own jurisdictions. \tThe guidelines will be translated into the official languages of the European Union (EU) and they will become applicable two months after the date of publication of their translations. \tNote to the editors \tThe European system for the supervision of the financial sector is made of three supervisory authorities: the European Securities and Markets Authorities (ESMA), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).

The report, which is part of a wider ongoing EBA work on comparability of RWAs, illustrates the findings of a so called \"drill-down analysis\", an investigation on the extent to which the most commonly used risk drivers influence the variability in risk weights. Overall, the analysis confirmed that risk parameters, such as loan to value, are drivers of RWAs. However, there are differences in how the banks reflect such drivers in RWAs. \tThe objective of this analysis was to understand if and how different variables describing the portfolios - besides the country cluster variables - could explain the differences in risk-weights across EU banks which were found in the first phase of this analysis. \tFindings \tThe analysis confirmed the existence of a positive correlation between the value of the different drill-down variables - loan to value at origination (LTVO), indexed loan to value (ILTV), debt to service at origination (DTSO) and loan to income at origination (LTIO) - and the risk weights at EU aggregated level. \tThe commonly used risk drivers, regardless of whether they are used by banks in the estimation of the probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD), or simply in the credit lending process, influence the risk weights final outcomes. \t\u00a0 \tThe existing differences in risk weights for residential mortgages are only partly explained by the risk weight sensitivity to the investigated risk drivers.

The identification of G-SIIs in the EU is aligned with the framework established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). These standards and guidelines will be part of the EU Single Rulebook in banking and aim at enhancing regulatory harmonisation and disclosure across the EU. \tThe Capital Requirements Directive, (CRD IV) requires G-SIIs to hold higher capital levels in order to contain the risks they pose to the financial system and the impact that their potential failure may have on sovereign finance and taxpayers, the so-called \u00a0\u2018too big to fail' problem. The final draft RTS provide consistent parameters and specify a harmonised methodology for identifying G-SIIs across the European Union (EU) and determining their adequate levels of capital. According to the CRD IV, competent authorities in each Member State shall calculate, on an annual basis, an individual score to measure a bank's systemic significance. To this end, the CRD IV defines five categories of indicators to be used in this scoring process. The final draft RTS specify twelve quantifiable indicators falling under these five categories, which ultimately measure the impact that the failure of an institution may have on the stability of the global financial system. The EBA will support competent authorities in carrying out the identification process, ensuring practicability and convergence. The final draft ITS define uniform requirements for disclosing the values used during the identification and scoring process of G-SIIs. Uniform and enhanced disclosure will ensure fair competitive conditions between comparable groups of institutions, thus resulting in greater convergence of supervisory practices and more accurate risk assessments across the EU. Furthermore, uniform disclosure aims at improving data quality and strengthening market discipline. This level of disclosure goes even beyond the minimum standards required by the BCBS. \tFinally, in order to increase transparency in the identification process, the final Guidelines stipulate that not only G-SIIs, but also other large institutions with an overall exposure of more than EUR 200 billion Euro and which are potentially systemically relevant, will be subject to the same disclosure requirement as the G-SIIs. The EBA will act as a central data hub in this disclosure process, thus providing a platform to aggregate data across the whole EU. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe final RTS, ITS and Guidelines have been developed in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD IV), and on the basis of internationally agreed standards, such as the framework established by the FSB, as well as the standards developed by the BCBS. \tThe identification as G-SII, which leads to a higher capital requirement, will take place in January 2015 for the first time, and the higher capital requirement will apply one year after the publication by competent authorities in each Member State of banks' scoring results so as to allow institutions enough time to adjust to the new buffer requirement.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-final-draft-technical-standards-and-guidelines-on-methodology-and-disclosure-for-global-systemically-important-institutions"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1215", "date": "2014-06-05", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes final draft technical standards on disclosure for the leverage ratio", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published its final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on disclosure for the leverage ratio.

While the extensive process of banks' balance sheet repair is already underway, the test, designed to assess banks' resilience to hypothetical external shocks, will identify remaining vulnerabilities in the EU banking sector and will provide a high level of transparency into EU banks' exposures. \tThe EBA 2014 EU wide stress test comes in the midst of the process of repair of EU banks' balance sheets and will follow asset quality reviews (AQRs) undertaken by various competent authorities in the EU. The EBA's common methodology will be used by all EU supervisory authorities to ensure that the main EU banks are all assessed against common assumptions, definitions and approaches. It will allow for results that are comparable across the EU, shedding further light into the EU banking sector, and facilitating the work of supervisors. The EBA also released the macroeconomic scenarios, developed by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) which will be used to assess the impact that changes in the economic environment have on EU banks. These are relevant to the entire EU single market and consistent throughout. \tAndrea Enria chairperson of the EBA said: \"The methodology developed by the EBA for the stress test will ensure a robust and effective tool for supervisors to address remaining vulnerabilities in the EU banking sector\". Enria continued: \"The exercise's full transparency will be key to its credibility: it will show how efforts recently undertaken by EU banks are already bearing fruit and it will provide a common framework for the next steps to be taken by supervisors and banks\". Key features of the methodology and the scenario The common methodology and underlying assumptions cover a wide range of risks including: credit and market risks, exposures towards securitisation, sovereign and funding risks. To ensure consistency, the methodology is restrictive and rests on a number of key constraints. These include a static balance sheet assumption, which precludes any defensive actions by banks, prescribed approaches to market risk and securitisation, and a series of caps and floors on net interest income, risk weighted assets (RWAs) and net trading income. \tOther key methodological components are: (i) a sovereign shock that impacts banks entire balance sheet including exposures held in the available for sale portfolio (AFS) via the internationally agreed gradual phase-out of prudential filters, (ii) a shock to banks funding costs that pass-through to the asset and liability side in a conservative asymmetric fashion. The adverse scenario, designed by the ESRB, reflects the systemic risks that are currently assessed as representing the most pertinent threats to the stability of the EU banking sector: (i) an increase in global bond yields amplified by an abrupt reversal in risk assessment, especially towards emerging market economies; (ii) a further deterioration of credit quality in countries with feeble demand; (iii) stalling policy reforms jeopardising confidence in the sustainability of public finances; and (iv) the lack of necessary bank balance sheet repair to maintain affordable market funding. \tThe negative impact of the shocks, which include also stress in the commercial real estate sector, as well as a foreign exchange shock in Central and Eastern Europe, is substantially global. In the EU, the scenario leads overall to a cumulative deviation of EU GDP from its baseline level by -2.2% in 2014, by -5.6% in 2015, and -7.0% in 2016. The EU unemployment is higher than its baseline level, by 0.6 percentage points in 2014, by 1.9 percentage points in 2015 and by 2.9 percentage points in 2016. \tFor most advanced economies, including Japan and the US, the scenario results in a negative response of GDP ranging between 5-6 per cent in cumulative terms compared to the baseline. Process \tThe EU-wide stress test will be conducted on a sample of 124 EU banks which cover at least 50% of each national banking sector, and will be run at the highest level of consolidation. The running of the exercise will involve close cooperation between the EBA and the Competent Authorities at national level (CAs), including the European Central Bank (ECB). The EBA will be responsible for coordinating the exercise in cooperation with the ECB (in case of Single Supervisory Mechanism - SSM countries) and ensuring effective cooperation between home and host supervisors.

The plan identifies key activities, necessary in 2014 for the effective oversight of Europe's cross border banking groups,\u00a0and is issued alongside a report providing an assessment on the colleges functioning during 2013. \tNational competent authorities and EBA made significant efforts in 2013 to improve the efficiency of supervisory cooperation in overseeing cross border banking groups via supervisory colleges. \u00a0Colleges of supervisors play a crucial role in the effective supervision of cross-border groups across the EU by acting as the coordination hub for supervisory activities and the forum for joint risk assessments and joint decisions regarding banks pillar 2 capital requirements. \tThe 2014 action plan draws on lessons from recent experience and takes into account the latest regulatory and institutional developments that will impact the functioning of colleges in 2014.\u00a0 \tThe completion in 2014 of a common methodology for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) in pillar 2 will allow for more consistency in the outcome of capital joint decisions by colleges of supervisors.\u00a0 \tIn 2014 colleges of supervisors will need to reach for the first time a joint decision on liquidity, under CRD IV (Capital Requirements Directive 2013/36/EU). The process of reaching joint decisions on liquidity will be supported by technical standards, and common templates issued by the EBA as well as a common methodology for the assessment of liquidity under SREP. \tColleges of supervisors will also play an important role in ensuring effective communication and coordination between national supervisors of cross-border banking groups during the 2014 AQRs and EU-wide stress test exercise. \tAs part of its mandate to improve supervisory cooperation and convergence of supervisory practices, the EBA produces regular internal reviews on college functioning which are discussed with all 28 competent authorities (CAs) in the EU to identify best practices, areas for improvements and priority tasks going forward. EBA is publishing this report in the interests of transparency and better informing the public about the important role of colleges in cross-border supervision. The report on colleges functioning and the 2014 action plan issued today were endorsed by the EBA Board of Supervisors.\u00a0 Note to the editors \tEnhanced cooperation between supervisory authorities is key to strengthening the supervision of cross-border banking groups, both at EU and global level.

Capital requirements on exposures to transferred credit risk (Article 512 of the CRR): the EBA will build its advice on the basis of the work it already carried out on securitisation retention rules. Implementation of the ICAAP and Pillar 2 requirements (Article 161(4) of the CRD): the EBA will provide advice on the use of waivers based on the analysis of data provided by National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Scope of application and exemption of Pillar 1 requirements (Article 508(1) of the CRR): the EBA will advise on the use of waivers and will base the work on data analysis provided by NCAs. Longer-term refinancing operations (Article 161(9) of the CRD): the EBA will report on the use and benefits of LTROs and other Central Bank funding support. Consistency of macro-prudential rules (Article 513 of the CRR): in the context of the consultation foreseen under Article 513 of the CRR, the EBA will focus its analysis on the procedural set-up of the macro-prudential framework and its overall consistency across the EU. Prudential filter for fair value gains and losses arising from the institution's own credit risk related to derivative liabilities (Article 502 of the CRR): the EBA will advise on the level of prudence of alternative methods to treat fair value gains and losses arising from an institutions' own credit standing, as well as the reasons why such methods would be necessary.

The objective of these draft RTS is to determine prudent values that can achieve an appropriate degree of certainty while taking into account the dynamic nature of trading book positions. These standards will be part of the EU Single Rulebook in banking aimed at enhancing regulatory harmonisation. Update: on 23 January 2015 the European Banking Authority (EBA) published an amended version (EBA/RTS/2016/06/rev1) of its final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on Prudent Valuation.

Two approaches are proposed in order to take proportionality into account, in particular for those institutions with limited exposure to fair valued positions: A Simplified approach, which can be used by institutions to calculate AVAs, provided their absolute value of on- and off-balance sheet fair valued assets and liabilities is below EUR 15 billion and provided they are not part of a group that exceeds this threshold; \t\t\u00a0 A Core approach, which is intended to provide a consistent framework for determining AVAs under a target level of certainty of 90%, using either a data based or expert based approach and including diversification benefits. \tThese final draft RTS reflect both the feedback received from the consultation document, as well as the results of the Quantitative Impact Study (QIS). The QIS was completed on a \"best efforts\" basis by 59 institutions across 15 jurisdictions. The QIS results showed that on average the expected AVA would be equivalent to 1.5 % of the CET1 of institutions in absolute terms (on average EUR 227 million per institution), which is on average 0.07 % of the value of fair-valued positions on banks' balance sheets.

These RTS will be part of the Single Rulebook in banking aimed at enhancing regulatory harmonisation in the European Union (EU) and at strengthening the quality of capital. \tIn this particular area of own funds, the EBA's mandate is twofold: one is related to multiple distributions and the other one to preferential distributions, which have been considered separately for joint-stock companies and non-joint stock companies. The provisions of these final draft RTS detail, in particular, whether and when multiple distributions would create a disproportionate drag on capital and clarify the meaning of preferential distributions \u2013 namely preferential rights to payments of distributions and order of payments of distribution. Furthermore, these RTS deal with the consequences of not meeting the criteria provided for in the regulation in terms of (dis)qualification of instruments as CET1 capital. \tInstruments with multiple distributions \tCapital instruments may include provisions that give rise to distributions that are a multiple of the distributions paid on voting Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) instruments (multiple distributions). However, only a subset of those instruments would be considered not to create a disproportionate drag on capital, and could therefore be included in CET1. \tThe draft final RTS aim at specifying harmonised criteria which are to be met by those instruments that are to be included in CET1, so as to ensure that the future loss absorbency of CET1 instruments is in no way compromised by disproportionate distributions that would create a drag on capital. In this respect, quantitative limits are set. These limits are expressed (i) in terms of the amount of distribution on one non-voting instrument with a multiple dividend compared with the amount of distribution on one voting instrument and (ii) in terms of the total amount of distribution paid on CET1 instruments. These criteria are restricted to joint stock companies. Instruments with preferential distributions \tPreferential distributions exist when holders of CET1 instruments have an advantage compared with other holders of CET1 instruments of the same institution, particularly regarding the timing and order of distribution payments. In addition, also those instruments where the distributions exceed the limits set with respect to multiple distributions are considered as preferential. In clarifying the definition of preferential distributions, these RTS aim at ensuring equal treatment among CET1 holders. \tFor joint stock companies, the approach is the same as for multiple distributions. For non-joint stock companies, and in order to take into account the specific features of this type of institutions, the approach is based on a set of criteria not strictly based on hard quantitative limits but on a combination of different factors related to the general features of instruments issued by non-joint stock companies. These criteria reflect, in particular, the nature of the holders of the non-voting instruments, the existence of a legal cap on the voting instruments, the voting rights and the average level of distributions.

The discount rate is calculated taking into account the length of the period between the award and the vesting of variable remuneration. \tThe notional discount rate, if the Member State has implemented this national discretion, can be applied to the variable remuneration for the performance year 2014 and onwards. For this purpose, institutions will be able to use the same discount rate in all relevant institutions at a group level. Legal basis \tThe Guidelines have been developed on the basis of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 (CRD) on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms. \tThe EBA has consulted on the draft Guidelines for a period of three month.

In doing so the proposed RTS take into account the increased uncertainty on the estimation of risk parameters as a consequence of using a shorter data history. \tIn particular, the EBA is proposing to introduce some conditions that would exclude from the waiver low-default portfolios and that would limit its application to a small proportion of assets.

Results show that the Common Equity Tier\u00a01 capital ratio (CET1) of the largest internationally-active European banks (Group\u00a01 banks) would be on average 9.1% compared to a ratio of 12% under the current regulation. Therefore, Group\u00a01 banks would face a CET1 capital shortfall of EUR 2.4\u00a0billion to achieve the minimum requirement of 4.5%, and of EUR 36.3\u00a0billion to reach the target level of 7.0% or the higher threshold set for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The latter capital shortfall would, therefore, be decreased by 48.4% (from EUR 70.4 billion to EUR 36.3 billion). \tFor Group 1 banks, the overall impact of Basel III on the CET1 ratio is attributed to changes both in the definition of capital as well as in the calculation of RWAs. \tAs for the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), results show that as of June 2013, the average LCR of Group\u00a01 banks would have been 104%. This means that two-thirds of the total sample of banks would have already met the final 100% requirement to be reached by 2019.

The EBA has produced the report on its own initiative to provide recommendations to the European Commission in view of its forthcoming delegated act on the definitions of leverage ratio. \tThe report uses data collected for the Basel III monitoring exercise as of 30 June 2013 through a sample consisting of 173 EU institutions from 18 Member States. \tOverall, the assessment indicates that the revised Basel III framework leads to leverage ratios that are broadly in line with, or possibly slightly higher than, leverage ratios calculated according to the current CRR. On this basis, and considering that the revised Basel III framework represents a more accurate measure of leverage, the EBA recommends, in the interest of consistency between the leverage ratio calculation within the EU and the other jurisdictions that implement Basel III, aligning the CRR definition of the leverage ratio's exposure measure to the Basel III framework. The analysis underlying this report has not indicated any EU specificities which would prompt a deviation from the BCBS standard. \tFurthermore, the EBA noted that with respect to the Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs), the current CRR text may allow for different interpretations, which is reflected in the report.

As part of the European System of Financial Supervision, it works closely with the other European Supervisory Authorities responsible for market (ESMA), insurance and occupational pensions (EIOPA), and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). The EBA has a broad remit in the areas of banking, payments and e-money regulation, as well as on issues related to corporate governance, auditing and financial reporting. Its tasks include preventing regulatory arbitrage, guaranteeing a level playing field (especially by building a single rule book for the European banking system) strengthening international supervisory coordination, promoting supervisory convergence and providing advice to EU institutions.

The dashboard looks at the evolution of Key Risk Indicators (KRI) from 55 banks across the EU in the third quarter of 2013. \tData in this edition of the EBA dashboard illustrates that EU banks' capital positions were fairly stable, although declining RWAs contributed to higher capital ratios. The quality of banks' loan portfolios is still a source of concern, in light of the weak macroeconomic scenario across the EU. Profitability remains at low levels, as the low interest rates environment along with declining lending volumes continue to affect net interest margins. Deleveraging is still progressing, although at a slower pace. Further adjustments in banks' balance sheets are likely to continue in the forthcoming quarters. \tThe EBA dashboard also highlights that funding conditions in 2013 have markedly improved compared to the previous year. The vast majority of banks, including banks headquartered in non-core countries, is able to cover its funding needs via market funding, including unsecured and new-style debt instruments. However, overall funding conditions remain susceptible to adverse trends, with many banks still substantially relying on central bank funding. Fragmentation of funding markets and uneven cost conditions remain also an issue of concern. \tThe EBA risk dashboard is part of the regular risk assessment conducted by the EBA and complements the Risk Assessment Report.

The objective of the EU-wide stress tests is to help supervisors assess the resilience of financial institutions in the European Union to adverse market developments. This exercise aims at ensuring consistency and comparability of the outcomes across all banks based on a common methodology, scenarios and accompanied by a consistent disclosure exercise. \tThe 2014 EU-wide stress test is designed to provide supervisors, market participants and institutions with consistent data to contrast and compare EU-banks' resilience under adverse market conditions. To this end, the EBA will provide competent authorities (CAs) with a consistent and comparable methodology, which will allow them to undertake a rigorous assessment of banks' resilience under stress. \tThe exercise has been designed also in coordination with the ECB, which in preparation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is conducting a comprehensive assessment comprising of a risk assessment, asset quality review and a stress test. \tThe EU-wide stress test will be conducted on a sample of 124 EU banks which cover at least 50% of each national banking sector, and will be run at the highest level of consolidation.\u00a0 Given its objectives, the 2014 EU-wide stress test will be conducted under the assumption of a static balance sheet which implies no new growth and constant business mix and model throughout the time horizon of the exercise. \tThe resilience of EU banks will be assessed under a period of three years (2014-2016). \tBanks will be required to stress a common set of risks including: credit risk, market risk, sovereign risk, securitisation and cost of funding. Both trading and banking book assets will be subject to stress, including off-balance sheet exposures. CAs may include additional risks and country-specific sensitivities beyond this common set but the published results should allow understanding the impact of the common set of risks in isolation. \tIn terms of capital thresholds, 8% Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) will be the capital hurdle rate set for the baseline scenario and 5.5% CET1 for the adverse scenario. The relevant CA may set higher hurdle rates and formally commit to take specific actions on the basis of those higher requirements. \tThe running of the exercise will involve close cooperation between the EBA and the CAs, including the ECB. In particular, the EBA will be responsible for coordinating the exercise in cooperation with the ECB (in case of SSM countries) and ensuring effective cooperation between home and host supervisors. Furthermore, the EBA will provide pan European benchmarks and will act as a data hub for the final dissemination of the common exercise. On the other hand, CAs will bear responsibility for overseeing the exercise with the banks and checking the quality of the results. \tThe methodology and scenario are expected to be published in April 2014 and banks' individual results to be released at the end of October. \u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-announces-key-features-of-the-2014-eu-wide-stress-test"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1256", "date": "2014-01-29", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes final draft technical standards on own funds requirements for investment firms", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on own funds requirements for investment firms based on fixed overheads.

The report identifies improvements in market confidence, funding and capital positions. However, it cautions about ongoing uncertainties on asset valuations and future profitability in a fragile economic environment. The report also draws attention to the risks of detrimental business practices and puts forward possible measures for addressing such vulnerabilities through coordinated policy and supervisory actions. \tThroughout the second semester of 2013, the EU banking sector observed overall improvements in market confidence from both debt and equity investors, with several indicators showing that confidence is returning. Funding conditions improved across the EU, in connection with an increasing demand from EU and non-EU investors for European bank debt. EU banks continued to strengthen their liquidity and funding positions by attracting more deposits. Nonetheless, the persistent high reliance on central bank funding, the side-effects of monetary accommodation and the existence of a weak macroeconomic environment, remain matters of concern. \tFollowing the EBA's recapitalisation exercise, capital levels have continued to improve, despite the challenging conditions in financial markets, and are now in line with major international peers, as shown in the EBA's latest transparency exercise. \tOn the contrary, the continuous deterioration of the quality of banks' loan portfolios, as well as low profitability levels, may pose challenges in maintaining adequate capital levels. Uncertainties about asset valuation were found to persist and remain a fundamental issue in the EU, heightening the need for rigorous Asset Quality Reviews (AQRs), with consistent definitions across the EU. The EBA recommendation on the need to conduct AQRs across major EU banks and the publication of the final draft Technical Standards on supervisory reporting on forbearance and non-performing exposures in October 2013 are preconditions for reliable AQRs. Banks are taking pre-emptive actions ahead of the supervisory actions resulting from the AQR, focusing on quantitative assessment of provisions, collateralisation and the values of exposures. EU bank's profitability continued to face significant headwinds, which are not likely to dissipate in 2014. The low interest rates environment creates pressure on bank net interest margins and earnings may not be sufficient to cover rising bad loans, leaving question marks over some banks' future profitability and viability. The need for bank restructuring and changes to business models will remain a key challenge and it is fundamental that supervisors create a more coordinated and robust analysis of banks' business models across the EU. \tSome uncertainties also remain in view of the entrance into force of the new regulatory framework, with significant strategic and implementation challenges, as well as the developments on bail-in requirements. The institutional reforms at EU level are key to breaking the sovereign-bank pernicious linkage, in particular the establishment of the banking union, including the creation of a more integrated framework for bank resolution and a single deposit guarantee scheme. \tA number of detrimental business practices of EU banks have also affected consumer confidence and increased reputational risks linked to the relationship between banks and consumers. As well as reputational risk, the potential prudential impact of conduct-related redress remains a concern. This will require heightened supervisory oversight and improvements in institutions' risk management functions, and a more general reassessment of the relationship between banks and their customers. \tA coordinated policy action remains fundamental for the coherence of the single market. The EU banking sector continues to be fragmented and the need for continued regulatory and supervisory convergence across the EU will remain a key challenge for the EBA. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThis report provides an update on risks and vulnerabilities in the EU banking sector. With this report and that prepared in July 2012, the EBA discharges its responsibility pursuant to Recital 43 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 to monitor and assess market developments and provide information to other EU institutions and the general public.

The advice provides specific recommendations that will inform the European Commission (EC) as to whether changes to legislation should be introduced in order to sterilise the effect of unrealised gains on regulatory capital (so-called \"prudential filters\"). \tThe EBA concluded that unrealised gains show significant volatility and may disappear quickly in certain market conditions. This is an issue of concern for banking supervisors, since depending on the economic environment unrealised gains may happen to represent a significant proportion of credit institutions' own funds. Hence, the EBA sees advantages in introducing prudential filters for unrealised gains. \tThe EBA also acknowledges that several aspects would have to be further analysed. In particular, the on-going work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in this area will have to be taken into due consideration, to assess the possible effects of a lack of international consistency. Moreover, the interaction of prudential filters with the forthcoming EBA's proposals on prudent valuation will need to be carefully assessed. \tThe EBA remains available to conduct further work should the EC decide to introduce prudential filters for unrealised gains. \tLegal basis and background \tThe Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) states that institutions shall not make adjustments to remove from their own funds unrealised gains or losses on their assets or liabilities measured at fair value. \tIn this context, Article 80(4) of the CRR mandates the EBA to provide advice to the EC by 1 January 2014 on possible treatments of unrealised gains measured at fair value other than including them in Common Equity Tier 1 without adjustment.

These RTS ensure a consistent EU wide implementation of the countercyclical buffer (CCB) to protect against excess credit growth. \tThe countercyclical buffer (CCB) was introduced by the CRD IV package so that national authorities can protect the banking system against potential losses when excess credit growth is associated with an increase in system wide risk. \tIn order to establish their exact institution-specific buffer rate, banks with relevant exposures to different jurisdictions must therefore assess the proportion of their exposures in each jurisdiction and need to identify the geographical location of their relevant credit exposures. These RTS specify in detail how the geographical location of credit, trading and securitisation exposures shall be determined, as mentioned in Article 140(7) CRD. \tThe main principle for identifying the geographical location of relevant exposures is the obligor principle, i.e. the residence of the obligor.

The latter is supplemented by an Opinion on CVA risk which further elaborates on the approach taken by the EBA in determining a proxy spread. The standards will be part of the Single Rulebook aimed at enhancing regulatory harmonisation in the banking sector in the European Union (EU). \tThe final draft RTS on the definition of market relate to the definition of the term \u2018market' to be applied for the calculation of the overall net position in equity instruments under the market risk standardised rules. The overall net position in equity instruments is used to calculate own funds requirements for equity general market risk according to Article 343 of the Regulation. The definition of market is based on a currency criterion, but solely for jurisdictions included in the Euro-zone. For the other jurisdictions, \u2018market' is defined using a nationality criterion. The currency criterion applied for the Euro-zone recognises that the introduction of a single currency has addressed some important elements of segmentation among equity markets, such as the elimination of foreign exchange currency risk, the presence of a common currency in which company results are reported or the existence of an integrated market with common rules. \tThe final draft RTS on CVA risk for the determination of a proxy spread and the specification of a limited number of smaller portfolios specify the data quality requirements and the minimum granularity of the attributes of rating, industry and region that institutions should consider when estimating an appropriate proxy spread for the determination of the own funds requirements for CVA. The standards provides the necessary flexibility in the determination of a proxy spread, so as to ensure an operational framework that uses the approved internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments for market risk. The RTS also specify the number and size of portfolios that fulfil the criterion of a limited number of smaller portfolios and, therefore, are allowed into the CVA Advanced approach despite not forming part of the scope of the Internal Model Method (IMM) for counterparty credit risk. Thresholds are defined in terms of number and size, below which non-IMM netting sets are deemed to fulfil the criterion of a limited number of smaller portfolios and, subject to permission from competent authorities, are allowed into the advanced method for the calculation of their own funds requirements for CVA risk. \tThe EBA opinion on CVA risk for the determination of a proxy spread states the main reasons why the EBA adopted a flexible approach in the final draft RTS on the determination of a proxy spread. In particular, the EBA questions the appropriateness of a unified proxy methodology for both market and CVA risks against an alternative approach that would require a proxy methodology to be used for CVA purposes only. However, the EBA recognises that this issue is part of a broader issue related to the entire CVA framework and that any possible solution should be further evaluated in light of its consistency with the Basel framework. In accordance with Article 456(2), the EBA is mandated to produce a report, whereby, in light of the issues raised by the implementation of the CVA risk charge, the relevance of some of the features of the CVA framework, together with the relevance of the provisions of these RTS, may be reconsidered. \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe EBA has developed these final draft RTS in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (colloquially known as Capital Requirements Regulation or CRR). \tThe final draft standards have been sent today to the European Commission for their adoption as EU Regulations that will be directly applicable throughout the EU.

These two reports provide the European Commission with specific recommendations for the purpose of its forthcoming delegated act. \tReport on impact assessment for liquidity measures \tThis Report combines an empirical analysis of liquidity data provided by 357 European banks on a voluntary basis, covering about 2/3 of total banking assets in the EU, case studies as well as a literature review on this topic. \tOverall, the analysis carried out by the EBA shows that a specification of the general liquidity requirement is not likely to have a material detrimental impact on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets or on the economy and the stability of the supply of bank lending. To a large extent, this can be explained by the fact that EU banks already show an average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 115 per cent. \tHowever, the potential impact differs depending on the business model. Diversified business models tend to be more adapted to the LCR than specialized banks. The EBA is, therefore, proposing specific derogations for certain business models under stringent and objective conditions. \tThe EBA concludes that the calibration of the liquidity coverage requirement as defined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and endorsed by Governors and Heads of Supervisors (GHOS) is generally appropriate also across the European Union. \tFinally, the EBA highlights that the work underway at the international level to recognise committed liquidity facilities (CLF) at central banks should be taken into due consideration. \tReport on appropriate uniform definitions of extremely HQLA and HQLA and on operational requirements for liquid assets \tThe EBA has developed an empirical analysis aimed at identifying the liquidity features of financial instruments at asset class level on the basis of a range of liquidity metrics (basically price and volume metrics) and variables captureing credit quality. \tThe final EBA recommendations for the definitions of liquid assets combine the results of this empirical analysis with qualitative supervisory judgment and reflect the great importance the EBA attaches to the alignment with the international standards defined by the BCBS. \tIn particular, the EBA recommends that all bonds issued or guaranteed by EEA Sovereigns, EEA Central Banks and Supranational Institutions qualify as extremely HQLA. In addition, the EBA recommends that some specific categories of covered bonds, Residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), corporate bonds, equities and bonds issued by local government institutions be considered as HQLA. \tAlthough the empirical analysis shows some differences in the liquidity features of sovereign bonds, a differentiation in the supervisory treatment would reinforce the fragmentation of the single market and the sovereigns-banks loop. \tAlso, despite the excellent liquidity features showed by some covered bonds, doubts remain as to whether these findings are sufficient to justify a deviation from the international standards and their inclusion in the category of extremely HQLA - in fact two thirds of the observations come from markets that did not experience a real estate crisis - \tLegal basis and next steps \tThe two Reports have been developed on the basis of Regulation 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (CRR). \tThe delegated act the European Commission is empowered to adopt, as per Article 460 of the CRR, to specify in detail the liquidity coverage requirement, shall be based, amongst others, on these Reports. \tTo this aim, the EBA has been mandated, to report to the European Commission (i) as per Article 509 (1) of the CRR on the impact of the liquidity coverage requirement on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union, on the stability of financial markets, on the economy and on the stability of the supply of bank lending; (ii) as per Article 509 (3) and 509 (5) of the CRR on appropriate uniform definitions of high and of extremely high liquidity and credit quality of transferable assets as well as on appropriate haircuts and on the operational requirements for the holdings of liquid assets for the purposes of liquidity reporting. \tAs per Article 460 the European Commission shall adopt the delegated act referred to by 30 June 2014 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-reports-on-liquidity"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1268", "date": "2013-12-19", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA publishes final draft Technical Standards on supervisory disclosure", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) which specify the format, structure, contents list and annual publication date of the supervisory information to be disclosed by competent authorities in the banking sector. \tThese final draft ITS are structured into seven articles covering the following areas: \t\tTemplates \u00a0where competent authorities will disclose information on texts of laws, regulations, administrative rules and general guidance adopted in their respective Member State in the field of prudential regulation; \t\tTemplates where competent authorities will provide information on how they exercise options and discretions available in EU law; \t\tTemplates where competent authorities will publish information on the general criteria and methodologies used for supervisory review and evaluation process; \t\tTemplates where competent authorities will disclose aggregate statistical data on key aspects of the implementation of the prudential framework; \u00a0 \t\tDetails on annual publication dates of the aforementioned information \tFollowing the conclusion of the consultation process, which ended in October 2013, the EBA finalised these draft ITS taking into account the responses to the relevant consultation paper - to the extent that comments could be addressed.

Furthermore, the EBA also released its report on the pro-cyclicality of banks' capital requirements, which supplements the work on comparability, together with a summary report that compiles all the work on comparability of RWAs for IRB models. \tThe objective of this work is to address unjustified differences in the denominator of the capital ratios, to understand the sources of such differences and, if need be, to formulate the necessary policy solutions to enhance convergence in supervisory and banks' practices, ultimately improving disclosure too. \tThe two reports related to IRB models published today and the two previously published interim reviews on the consistency of credit risk RWAs together with the pro-cyclicality report have been compiled in a summary report which has been submitted today to the European Commission, in line with the EBA's mandate in the CRR. \tThe summary report includes the policy responses that the EBA considers as particularly important for addressing concerns about RWA consistency. In this respect, the EBA will focus its future work on the following aspects: \t\tEnhancing disclosure and transparency of RWA-related information. \t\tSupporting competent authorities in properly implementing the single rulebook with the delivery of existing mandates set out in the CRR. These include the important benchmarking work on RWA parameters that supervisors can use to assess model outcomes. \t\tDeveloping additional guidance that specifically addresses and facilitates consistency in supervisory and banks' practices, which includes for example uniform default definitions and harmonised treatment of defaulted assets under the IRB approach, clearer guidance on PD and LGD estimations and treatment of low-default assets. \tReport on SMEs and residential mortgages \tThis report outlines the interim results of the third stage of the EBA's work on banking book exposures and focuses on SMEs and residential mortgages portfolios. Forty-three banks provided quantitative and qualitative information on the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) models used for Residential Mortgages, SME Retail and SME Corporate, along with the historical data used for the development and calibration of the internal approaches. \tOne key finding was the importance of defaulted assets which account for over half of the variation in risk weights and expected losses. The underlying portfolio mix represents around a third of the variation in the overall Global Charge (GC) and Risk Weights (RW) for non-defaulted assets. The remaining two thirds of the dispersion for non-defaulted assets can be attributed to other drivers such as: differences in underlying credit risk, use of credit risk mitigation, modelling and supervisory practices. The geographical location of the exposures, notably the different economic conditions and other country-specific aspects, also play an important role. Regarding SMEs, the size of the enterprise influences variations in RWAs. \tReport on the comparability of supervisory rules and practices \tThe EBA also issued a report on the impact of supervisory rules and practices on comparability of capital requirements under the IRB approach across the EU. On the basis of data collected from EU supervisors, the EBA noticed divergences in terms of how regulatory frameworks are implemented at national level. Some aspects were identified that may require additional work to ensure better harmonisation of supervisory practices across the EU. These relate to aspects such as supervisory practices, roll-out plans, PD and downturn LGD computation. \tReport on pro-cyclicality of the IRB approach \tAs mandated by the European Commission, the EBA also assessed whether the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) contributes to pro-cyclicality in the financial system, i.e. whether the capital requirement regulation exacerbates business cycle fluctuations. Capital requirements under the IRB approach are inherently risk sensitive, through the input risk parameters to IRB models, namely the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). During a downturn, assessments of credit and market risk may increase, and may force banks to hold more capital against those increased risks. As a consequence, banks may shrink their lending behaviour, and may hence contribute to the downturn. The question addressed in this report is, therefore, whether the design of the current capital requirement regulation is a cause of higher business cycle fluctuations. On the basis of currently available data, the EBA found limited evidence for pro-cyclicality of capital requirements, and could not to establish a clear link between capital requirements legislation and pro-cyclicality. \tReport on variability of RWAs for market risk portfolios \tBesides the RWA work related to credit risk, the EBA has also focused its attention on market risk. This report outlines the conclusions stemming from a market hypothetical portfolio exercise (HPE) which the EBA conducted in 2013 in parallel with a similar exercise performed by the Basel Committee. The report focuses on the level of variability in banks' internal models for market RWAs. This study shows that, for banks applying historical simulation, around 30% of the variability observed for individual portfolios and 50% for the aggregated ones may be driven by modelling options explicitly provided for in the CRR. The EBA has also conducted a Profit and Loss (P&L) analysis, which is complementary to the assessment of variability based solely on model outcomes. This analysis provides, for each individual portfolio, an assessment of the degree of P&L volatility and correlation across banks.

These identified staff will be subject to provisions related, in particular, to the payment of variable remuneration. The EBA will submit the draft RTS on 16 December 2013 to the European Commission. They are part of the EBA work on the Single Rulebook aimed at enhancing regulatory harmonisation in the banking sector in the European Union (EU). \tThe EBA draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) look at remuneration packages for identified staff categories and aim at ensuring that appropriate incentives for long-term oriented and prudent risk taking are provided. This will ultimately contribute to supporting financial stability across the EU, as inappropriate incentives for management and employees -for instance, with disproportionate rewards on the upside and insufficient penalties on the downside- have often led to short-term oriented and excessively risky strategies. \tThese draft RTS propose a methodology for identifying staff that is consistent across the EU. They are based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative criteria and will have to be applied by all institutions subject to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). \tWhile these common criteria ensure consistency and a level playing field across the EU single market, they may not cover all specific aspects of some institutions' risk profiles. The CRD requires that all staff having a material impact on the risk profile of an institution be identified. In line with its mandate, the EBA has focused on quantitative and qualitative criteria, whereas an internal self-assessment will still have to be carried out by each institution to ensure full compliance with CRD requirements. \tAs a general principle, staff shall be identified as having a material impact on the institution's risk profile if they meet one or more of the following criteria: Standard qualitative criteria: related to the role and decision-making power of staff members (e.g. staff is a member of a management body, is a senior manager, has the authority to commit significantly to credit risk exposures, etc.). Standard quantitative criteria: related to the level of total gross remuneration in absolute or in relative terms. In this respect, staff should be identified if: \t\ttheir total remuneration exceeds, in absolute terms, EUR 500,000 per year, or \t\tthey are included in the 0.3 % of staff wit+h the highest remuneration in the institution, or \t\ttheir remuneration is equal or greater than the lowest total remuneration of senior management and other risk takers. Exclusion criteria: the draft RTS allow in justified cases, under additional conditions and subject to supervisory review, the exclusion of staff identified only according to standard quantitative criteria. In this respect, for staff with an awarded total remuneration of EUR 500,000 or more, institutions need to notify exclusions to the competent authority. For staff with a total awarded remuneration of EUR 750,000 or for staff included in the 0.3\u00a0% of the highest earners, a prior approval of exclusions is required. For staff with a total awarded remuneration of EUR 1,000,000 or more competent authorities need to inform the EBA about such intended exclusions before the decision is made. Institutions will have to submit the notification or application and demonstrate that the excluded staff on the basis of the business unit they are working in, as well as of their duties and activities have indeed no material impact on the institution's risk profile. Background and next steps \tA survey on the implementation of the Guidelines on Remuneration policies and practices published by the EBA in 2012 demonstrated that the percentage of staff being \u2018identified' still differs significantly from one jurisdiction to the other. Moreover, the criteria used by the different institutions for the identification of staff did not always consider sufficiently the impact on the institution's risk profile and therefore failed, sometimes, to appropriately identify staff members. \tThese draft RTS have been developed on the basis of Directive\u00a02013/36/EU (CRD), which provides a mandate for the EBA to set out qualitative and appropriate quantitative criteria for the identification of categories of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the institution's risk profile as referred to in Article 92 (2). \tThese draft RTS will be submitted to the European Commission for adoption and published on the EBA website on 16 December 2013. They will enter into force after their publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The EBA will review the development of identification practices and the exclusion of staff in the course of 2015.

The work aims at ensuring a transparent identification process in line with international regulatory work on global systemically important banks. The public consultation runs until 28 February 2014 and covers the draft RTS on the methodology for identifying G-SIIs, and draft ITS and Guidelines on the disclosure of the value of indicators used in the identification process. \tThe draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) provide consistent parameters and specify a harmonised methodology for identifying G-SIIs and determining adequate levels of own funds across the European Union. The Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) requires that each year Member States' authorities calculate an individual score to measure a bank's systemic significance. Five categories of indicators to be used in this scoring process are defined in the CRD and the EBA draft RTS specify twelve further sub-indicators falling under these categories. \tThe draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) define uniform disclosure requirements to publicise the values used for the identification and scoring process for G-SIIs. These ensure fair competitive conditions between comparable groups of institutions, resulting in greater convergence of supervisory practices and more accurate risk assessments across the EU. Furthermore, uniform disclosure improves data quality and strengthens market discipline. \tIn order to ensure a transparent identification process and a level playing field, the proposed draft Guidelines foresee that not only G-SIIs, but also other large institutions with an overall exposure of more than EUR 200 billion Euro and which are potentially systemically relevant, will be subject to the same disclosure requirement. \tConsultation process \tComments can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the respective consultation pages. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 28 February 2014. \tAll contributions received will be published following the close of the consultation, unless requested otherwise. \tBackground \tIn order to compensate for the higher risk that Global Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs) represent for the financial system and the impact that their potential failure may have on sovereign finance and taxpayers, the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) foresees that higher own funds requirements should be imposed on G-SIIs. \tThe EBA developed these RTS on the basis of internationally agreed standards, such as the framework established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), as well as standards for assessing Global Systemically Important Banks and for higher loss absorbency requirements developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). What is more, in order to reduce the administrative burden for institutions, the identification of G-SIIs in the EU is synchronised with the BCBS process. This allows institutions to report the same data to both the BCBS and national authorities at Member States level.

The EBA said that consumers are not protected through regulation when using virtual currencies as a means of payment and may be at risk of losing their money. It also added that there is no guarantee that currency values remain stable The warning was issued while the Authority assesses further all relevant aspects associated with virtual currencies, in order to identify whether virtual currencies can and should be regulated and supervised. \tAccording to the EBA, while virtual currencies continue to hit the headlines and are enjoying increasing popularity, consumers need to remain aware of the risks associated with them. In particular, consumers should be aware that exchange platforms tend to be unregulated and are not banks that hold their virtual currency as a deposit. Currently, no specific regulatory protections exist in the EU that would protect consumers from financial losses if a platform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or goes out of business. \tThe EBA added that the \u2018digital wallets' containing consumers' virtual currency stored on computers, laptops or smart phones, are not impervious to hackers. Cases have been reported of consumers losing significant amounts of virtual currency, with little prospect of having it returned. Also, when using virtual currency for commercial transactions, consumers are not protected by any refund rights under EU law. \tThe EBA also reminded that as transactions in virtual currency provide a high degree of anonymity, they may be misused for criminal activities, including money laundering. This misuse could lead law enforcement agencies to close exchange platforms at short notice and prevent consumers from accessing or retrieving any funds that the platforms may be holding for them. \tConsumers should also remain mindful that holding virtual currencies may have tax implications, and should make sure that they give due consideration to whether tax liabilities apply in their country when using virtual currencies. \tThe EBA recommended that, if consumers\u00a0 buy virtual currencies, \u00a0they should fully understand their specific characteristics and not use \u2018real' money that they cannot afford to lose. \tBackground \tAbout virtual currencies \tA virtual currency is a form of unregulated digital money, not issued or guaranteed by a central bank, which can act as means of payment. Virtual currencies have come in many forms, beginning as currencies within online computer gaming environments and social networks, and developing into means of payment accepted \u2018offline' or in \u2018real life'. It is now increasingly possible to use virtual currencies as a means to pay for goods and services with retailers, restaurants and entertainment venues. These transactions often do not incur any fees or charges, and do not involve a bank. \tMore recently, the virtual currency \u2018Bitcoin' has set the scene for a new generation of decentralised, peer-to-peer virtual currencies - often also referred to as crypto-currencies. \tVirtual currencies can be bought at an exchange platform using conventional currency. They are then transferred to a personalised account known as a \u2018digital wallet'. Using this wallet, consumers can send virtual currencies online to anyone else willing to accept them, or convert them back into a conventional fiat currency (such as the Euro, Pound or Dollar). \tAbout the EBA \tThe European Banking Authority (EBA) is a regulatory agency of the European Union, it provides advice to EU institutions in the areas of banking, payments and e-money regulation, as well as on issues related to corporate governance, auditing and financial reporting. Its overall objectives are to maintain financial stability in the EU and to safeguard the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of the banking sector. \tThe EBA also promotes a transparent, simple and fair internal market for EU consumers in financial products and services. The EBA seeks to foster consumer protection in financial services across the EU by identifying and addressing detriment consumers may experience, or are at risk of experiencing, in their dealings with financial firms. \tThe EBA was established on 1 January 2011 as part of the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) and took over all existing responsibilities and tasks of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors. \t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-warns-consumers-on-virtual-currencies"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_1286", "date": "2013-12-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA publishes follow-up review of banks transparency in their 2012 reports", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a follow-up review aimed at assessing the disclosures made by 19 European institutions in response to the Basel Pillar 3 requirements, as set out in the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). Overall, despite improvements in some specific areas, credit institutions' compliance with disclosure requirements remains unchanged compared to last year's assessment where no bank had fully met all the requirements. The report also highlighted that comparability and consistency of disclosures between the different institutions could be improved. \tScope and main findings \tThis EBA report focused, in particular, on those areas where the need for improvement had already been identified in the past: namely scope of application, own-funds and disclosures related to credit exposures under the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach, securitisation, market risk and remuneration. For each of these areas, the report identified best practices, and encourages institutions to implement them so as to improve their compliance with disclosure requirements, as well as the relevance of their disclosures. Best practices sometimes resulted from the implementation of recommendations from other official or industry-led initiatives carried out in 2012 and 2013 to improve disclosure. \tThe report also highlighted some improvements on scope of application and own-funds, with an increase in information on the differences between the accounting and regulatory scope of consolidation, as well as on the reconciliation between the accounting own-funds and the capital instruments. Nevertheless, improvements are still needed on the applicability of disclosure requirements, the granularity of deductions from capital, and information on the terms and conditions of capital instruments. \tOn the other hand, disclosures regarding credit exposures under the IRB approach, securitisation activities and market risk have showed only marginal improvements, if any. In particular, for IRB exposures, improvements are needed regarding information on losses and their back testing, and additional granularity should be provided in the description of rating processes as well as in the breakdown of exposures by internal grades. Compliance of securitisation disclosures should be improved especially in regard to risk management descriptions and the scope of quantitative disclosures. As for disclosures on market risk, improvements have been made with respect to disclosures on VaR and backtesting of models, but more remains to be done, especially regarding the breakdown of capital requirements, internal model methodologies by portfolios and prudent valuation of exposures. \tFinally, disclosures on remuneration were assessed as satisfactory, although quantitative information should, in general, be improved, especially regarding the breakdown of remuneration outstanding by business lines and vested and unvested amounts. \tThe findings of this assessment were presented to the public on November 28, 2013 and are available on the EBA Transparency Workshop page. Next steps \tBased on the findings and content of this report, the EBA will continue to promote more compliant, consistent and comparable disclosures and in line with its mandate set out in the CRR, it will produce Guidelines on different areas of disclosure. In addition, the EBA will continue to push for improvements in the consistency of disclosures, including in the short term.

These principles cover in particular the responsibilities of manufacturers and producers in setting up processes, functions and strategies for designing and marketing financial products, as well as at reviewing the products' life cycle. \tThe Joint Position of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) highlights in particular that the design of financial products and services poses risks to consumers when the target market is not correctly identified. These risks can also arise when the objectives and characteristics of the target market are not duly taken into account in the marketing of products to consumers. These issues have previously arisen at EU level across the three sectors of banking, insurance and securities. \tThe eight high level principles developed by the three ESAs in their Joint Position stress the importance of the controls that manufacturers should put in place before launching their products, thus discouraging products and services that may cause consumer detriment from entering the market and thus ultimately enhancing consumers' confidence in financial markets. \tThe Joint Position is not directly addressed to market participants and competent authorities but it will provide a high-level, consistent basis for the development of more detailed principles addressed to manufactures by each ESA in the respective sectors. The Joint position is therefore without prejudice to any work that is being developed by each ESA, including in the context of the review of sectoral Directives. \tNote to editors \tThe Joint Committee of three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), is a forum established on 1 January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation and ensuring cross-sectoral consistency between the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), collectively known as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs).

These RTS will be part of the Single Rulebook in banking aimed at enhancing regulatory harmonisation in Europe and namely at strengthening the quality of capital. The consultation runs until 24 January 2014. Instruments with multiple distributions \tCapital instruments may include provisions that give rise to distributions that are a multiple of the distributions paid on voting Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) instruments (multiple distributions) or that are different from those paid on voting CET1 instruments (differentiated distributions). However, only a subset of those instruments would be considered not to create a disproportionate drag on capital, and could therefore be included in CET1. \tThe draft RTS aim at proposing harmonised criteria which are to be met by those instruments that are to be included in CET1, so as to ensure that the future loss absorbency of CET1 instruments is in no way compromised by disproportionate distributions that would create a drag on capital. In this respect, quantitative limits are proposed. These limits are expressed (i) in terms of the amount of distribution on one non-voting instrument with a multiple dividend compared with the amount of distribution on one voting instrument and (ii) in terms of the total amount of distribution paid on CET1 instruments. \tThese criteria are devised for joint stock companies (JS) whereas a different approach is also proposed for non-joint stock companies (NJS) in order to take into account their specificities. However, the EBA is investigating further the legal scope of its mandate with reference to the latter institutions. Instruments with preferential distributions \tPreferential distributions exist when holders of CET1 instruments have an advantage compared with other holders of CET1 instruments of the same institution, particularly regarding the timing and order of distribution payments. In addition, also those instruments where the distributions exceed the limits set with respect to multiple distributions are considered as preferential. In clarifying the definition of preferential distributions, these RTS aim at ensuring equal treatment among CET1 holders.

The aim of the peer review was to assess and compare the effectiveness of the supervisory activities related to the review of credit institutions' own stress testing frameworks across the EU, as well as the implementation of related provisions by competent authorities. The report shows that National Competent Authorities (NCAs) largely comply with the three assessed guidelines (18, 19 and 20). Key features of the peer review work and main findings In line with its mandate to assess the degree of convergence to the EBA guidelines, the EBA selected the guidelines on stress testing to perform a peer review analysis given the special emphasis placed on this topic by NCAs over the last couple of years. The peer review work focused on methods and examples of best practice, and covered (i) stress testing governance structures and their use, (ii) possible methodologies including the appropriate severity of scenarios and potential mitigating measures during stressed conditions, and (iii) the overall impact of risk on institutions. The following conclusions emerged from the peer review and in particular from on-site visits performed by the EBA: All NCAs' resource models have benefits. However, irrespective of the model, dedicated stress testing technical experts should be involved. Stress test instructions at national level are currently spread over various supervisory manuals, hence the need for centralised documents. NCAs often focus on the (few) largest banks in their respective jurisdictions, and devote far less attention to other banks. The incorporation of stress testing into the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) and the joint decision process is handled differently across NCAs. Many of the assessed NCAs carry out substantial work on top-down stress testing, from both a micro- and macro-prudential perspective. Very few NCAs require reverse stress testing, and when so it is often as part of a recovery and resolution plan. Best practices In terms of best practices, the implementation of the EBA Guidelines has resulted in more effective supervisory activities, especially in terms of standard procedures to assess stress testing. Another example of good practice identified is the comparison between banks with similar characteristics and historical information, which could constitute a central input to the SREP/JRAD (Joint Risk Assessment and Decision) for cross border banking groups. Finally, the results of the report encourage discussions about the stress test in supervisory colleges. All relevant information should be used in the joint decision process, together with documented processes, principles and methodologies. Legal basis Peer reviews are conducted in accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 (\u2018the EBA Regulation') and the EBA decision establishing the Review Panel.

In particular, data in the EBA dashboard illustrates that capital positions have been significantly strengthened and that funding conditions have recovered.

In particular, the EBA will be consulting on 1) draft ITS on currencies for which the justified demand for liquid assets exceeds their availability; 2) draft RTS on derogations for eligible currencies; and 3) draft ITS listing the currencies with an extremely narrow definition of central bank eligibility. All three consultations will run until 22 December 2013. Key features of the three draft technical standards \tThe draft implementing technical standard (ITS) on currencies for which the justified demand for liquid assets exceeds their availability aim at drawing a list of currencies featuring constraints on the availability of liquid assets. The list has been compiled on the basis of data gathered by Member States. In particular, the data collection has been completed for two currencies: the Norwegian krone (NOK) and the Danish krone (DKK). This list of currencies with constraints will be revised once a final definition of liquid assets is available at EU level. \tThe draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) on derogations for eligible currencies aim at specifying the derogations that could be applied to those currencies facing constraints on the availability of liquid assets. These standards aim to address the inherent difficulties that institutions would face in meeting their liquidity coverage requirement even in spite of a sound liquidity management. Although the RTS try to discourage, to the extent possible, the use of derogations, these may have to be applied in those circumstances where an institution can prove that, despite all mitigating actions undertaken, the need for liquid assets remains. Institutions willing to apply such derogations will, amongst other conditions, have to notify competent authorities and to provide detailed information 30 days prior to the initial use of the derogation. \tThe draft implementing technical standards (ITS) on currencies with an extremely narrow definition of central bank eligibility aim at drawing a list of currencies in which only central government debt or debt issued by the central bank is eligible as collateral for standard liquidity operations at the central bank. Based on this definition, as well as on the information provided by Member States, only the Bulgarian leva appears to have extremely narrow central bank eligibility. \tConsultation process \tComments can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page of each of the three consultations.

Results show that the Common Equity Tier\u00a01 capital ratio (CET1) of the largest European banks (Group\u00a01 banks) would be on average 8.4% compared to a ratio of 11.5% under current regulation.

In particular, increased volatility in longer-term interest rates and concerns about the future path of interest rates - combined with the current low interest rate environment - created uncertainty for financial institutions in their hedging and impacted profitability. \tWhen it comes to cross-border banking activity, there is strong evidence of a fragmented European financial sector, and in particular of a material scale back of intra-EU cross-border lending into economies experiencing sovereign stress or recession. There is also uncertainty on the timely and proper recognition of losses that are embedded in portfolios of financial assets. Market uncertainties regarding perceived inconsistencies in the calculation of banks' risk weighed assets (RWAs) have further affected the perception of EU banks. Conduct of business risks also continues to be a concern from both a conduct and prudential perspective. \tSince the previous publication in April 2013, some important policy milestones reinforcing the EU financial regulation have been reached. These address a number of the concerns mentioned above, and include the adoption of the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation, the Council's general approach on a framework for Banking Recovery and Resolution, and, in particular, the agreement on establishing the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) for banks. Prior to starting the SSM, action will be taken across the EU in order to address uncertainties in balance sheet valuations. \tIn addition, ESMA and the EBA have also developed a series of Principles for Benchmark-Setting Processes in the EU which aim to address public concerns about these widely used benchmark setting processes, while EIOPA continued to work with national supervisory authorities on their responses to a prolonged low interest rate environment and delivered its technical advice on the way forward for the introduction of the Solvency II long-term guarantee package. \tGabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA and current Chairman of the Joint Committee, said: \t\"The integration of financial markets in the EU no longer allows us to address risks at national or sectoral level only, as interconnectedness across financial sectors and geographies is high. This requires us, both regulators and policymakers, to take a much broader view in order to identify cross-sectoral risks and to address and mitigate the threats to the stability of the financial sector. \t\"It is, therefore, crucial that the three ESAs continue to coordinate their policy actions in addressing, and mitigating the risks our markets face. The Joint Committee's Risk Reports play a key role in providing a cross-sectoral picture on risks and informing the work of policy makers, and regulators, in developing appropriate responses\". \tBesides work on specific policy, firms' actual conduct-of-business risks vis-a-vis consumers remained another concern from both a conduct and prudential perspective. As ultimately, ensuring the interests of investors are met no matter what financial product is sold remains a key driver of the ESAs' work. Notes for editors \tThe Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1st January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely and ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering.\u00a0In addition to being a forum for cooperation, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). \tThe full text of the report can be viewed here: Report - August 2013 \t\u00a0 \tFor press queries: EIOPA \tAnzhelika Mayer \t+49(0)6995111968 press@eiopa.europa.eu ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/european-supervisory-authorities-highlight-cross-sectoral-risks"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_1328", "date": "2013-09-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EBA consults on draft technical standards on methods for identifying the geographical location of relevant credit exposures", "text": " The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a consultation on draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) setting out criteria for identifying the geographical location of all relevant credit exposures, namely credit risk, trading book and securitisation exposures. These RTS will be part of the Single Rulebook aimed at enhancing regulatory harmonisation in the banking sector in the European Union (EU). The consultation runs until 1 November 2013. \tUnder the capital requirements rules in the EU, institutions at Member State level are required to hold countercyclical buffers (CCB) to protect the banking system against potential losses when excess credit growth is associated with an increase in system wide risks. The size of countercyclical buffers will depend on the countercyclical buffer rates set by national authorities and the portfolio distribution of the institutions. In particular, the buffers to be held by individual institutions with cross-border activities will depend on the geographical location of their credit portfolios and not on the location of the institutions that hold these exposures. \tThe geographical location is to be determined for certain credit risk, trading book and securitisation exposures, as set out in Article 140 of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). \tThe consultation paper outlines the principles behind the identification of the geographical location of these exposures, on the basis of which the institution-specific countercyclical buffer rates shall be determined. In particular, the consultation paper proposes to use the location of the obligor or debtor as a general principle for the identification of the geographical location. \tIn order to ease the implementation of these standards for banks with limited cross-border activities and trading book activities, proportionality measures have been introduced in order to reduce the operational burden on these institutions. \tConsultation process \tComments can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the consultation page.

This report illustrates the outcomes of the next stage in the EBA's review into RWA consistency in sovereigns, institutions and large corporate exposures, generally referred to as low default portfolios (LDP). The aim was to identify and further understand the sources of any material differences in RWA outcomes for portfolios which are specifically challenging for the banks due to limited availability of data. This analysis is closely aligned with the global work of the Basel Committee which recently released the results of their report. \tOutcome of the LDP review \tFollowing the first top down analysis which identified the most obvious drivers of differences, this comparative analysis, conducted with a benchmarking portfolio exercise, found relevant differences in: \t\tThe scope of the application of internal models to LDP counterparts (e.g., application of the standardised approach - permanent exemption and roll-out); \t\tThe probabilities of default (PDs) and the loss given defaults (LGDs) parameters for the same exposure to a counterparty; \t\tThe definition of default and the computation of the default rate used for the calibration of the internal models; \t\tThe computation of risk weights and expected losses on defaulted assets. \tThe study also identified the existence of discrepancies in the ways of computing maturity parameters, the Credit Conversion Factor (CCF) parameters applied for calculating the exposure at default (EAD) and banks' reporting practices. \tMoreover, the report noted that banks' choices or supervisory requests to apply minimum PDs, LGDs or add-ons to the risk weights computed with the internal models could create challenges in comparing the outcomes. \tPolicy options and actions \tWhile some differences in risk weights are foreseen in the Basel II regulatory framework when using internal models, some inconsistencies appear driven by bank and supervisory practices that require further analysis. The EBA will address some of these unwarranted variations through the development of regulatory and implementing technical standards, as mandated by the Capital Requirement Regulation (CRR). Four areas have been identified where additional efforts and work are needed: Supervisory disclosure and banks' transparency on RWA-related information needs to be enhanced. Some RWA-related information will be incorporated in the transparency exercise that the EBA is expected to carry out in the second half of 2013; \t\tBanks should be more rigorous in the validation and monitoring processes of their internal models. Good practices should be identified, promoted and shared; Additional Guidelines and Technical Standards addressing specific LDP issues should be developed, so as to foster convergence in supervisory assessments and banks practices; Benchmarks or constraints for some IRB risk parameters could be developed, so as to control and possibly reduce unjustified variations in risk weights and expected losses, as well as to increase awareness among supervisors and banks on the variability of the parameters. \tCommenting on this review, Andrea Enria, Chairperson of the EBA, said: \"This is an important step in a series of exercises the EBA is conducting with the aim of ensuring consistency in the calculation of RWAs across the EU. Some National Supervisory Authorities are already taking actions based on the outcomes of this work. The EBA will provide appropriate disclosure of RWA-related information and coordinate further work to restore market confidence in risk sensitive measures of capital adequacy.\" \tBy the end of 2013, the EBA is expected to finalise a market risk benchmarking exercise on the trading book and to publish a review of risk weights for SMEs and residential mortgages. \tMethodology underlying the LDP review \tThe review of LDP portfolios is based on a Hypothetical Portfolio Exercise (HPE) that the EBA carried out in the second half of 2012. The exercise involved 35 banks from 13 EU countries using the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach. \tThe HPE was designed to allow a direct comparison of the IRB parameters - probabilities of default ( PDs) and loss given defaults (LGDs) - and the resulting risk weights on a set of common counterparties which would be assuming senior and unsecured exposures (hypothetical exposures). Banks participating in the exercise were also asked to report the real risk weights and expected losses applied to the same set of counterparties (real exposures). This comparative analysis between hypothetical and real portfolio exposures allowed the EBA to examine the impact of the maturity and credit risk mitigation of the exposures. \tThe HPE was complemented with important qualitative information as well as with bilateral interviews conducted with a selected sample of 12 banks, which allowed the EBA to gain a deeper insight into key practices that have a bearing on the outcome of banks' IRB models. In addition, data were also collected on parameters and risk weights for the overall wholesale exposures (sovereigns, institutions, large corporate and other corporate).

The Recommendation aims to preserve the enhanced capital base that banks built by 30 June 2012, in response to the EBA's 2011 recapitalisation Recommendation. \tIn December 2011, the EBA issued a Recommendation asking national supervisory authorities to ensure banks had sufficient capital to withstand unexpected losses in case of a further deterioration of the economic situation. Since the legal framework for assessing capital levels has changed with the entering into force of the so-called \"CRD IV package\", the EBA has decided to replace the 2011 recapitalisation Recommendation with a new measure on capital preservation. \tIn particular, the Recommendation on capital preservation asks competent authorities to ensure that banks maintain a capital floor in terms of nominal amount which corresponds to the amount of capital required to be in place by 30 June 2012 to meet the EBA's Recommendation. \tAndrea Enria, Chairperson of the EBA said: \"Preserving capital in European banks is essential for maintaining the flow of lending to the real economy\". \tIn case banks fall below this nominal amount, they are expected to produce credible plans to restore their capital base. Only in specific circumstances will exceptions be granted on a case by case basis. Exceptions can be granted by national authorities, in consultation with the EBA, if a bank is undergoing a specific restructuring or a de-risking programme or if a bank's capital levels are deemed to already exceed the CET1 requirements under fully implemented CRD/CRR rules. \tNext steps \tNational authorities, in close cooperation with the EBA, will assess banks' capital plans during the transition to the CRD/CRR full implementation. To this end, banks will be requested to submit their capital plans and monitoring templates to their respective national authorities by 29 November 2013.

The report analyses the main developments and trends affecting the sector in the current year and provides an outlook of the main micro-prudential risks and vulnerabilities, as well as of related policy implications. The report also puts forward possible measures for addressing these risks through coordinated policy and supervisory actions. \tMain findings \tThroughout the first semester of 2013, the EU banking sector has continued to observe limited improvements in market confidence from both debt and equity investors. In 2011 and 2012, also thanks to the initiatives carried out by the EBA, capital levels improved despite the challenging conditions in financial markets. Nonetheless, the deterioration of the quality of banks' loan portfolios, as well as low profitability levels, may still pose challenges in maintaining adequate capital levels and therefore need to be monitored carefully. \tMore generally, there is increasing uncertainty about the quality of banks' assets and valuation. The agreement reached at the EBA table on the need to conduct asset quality reviews across major EU banks will contribute to dispel concerns over the deterioration of loan books, especially if appropriate and consistent disclosure is provided. Profitability has continued to face significant headwinds that are not likely to dissipate in the second half of 2013. The low interest rates environment creates some pressure on bank net interest margins, particularly for banks with exposures to tracker-type mortgages, and increases the risk of hidden forbearance, which in turn leads to the build-up of latent credit risk and to inefficient market allocation of available credit resources. At the same time, net interest margins are under pressure due to higher private funding costs. \tOn the funding side, the funding conditions have made progress, with some consistent banks' issuance of un\u00adsecured debt. There has also been some evidence of deposit inflows from both retail and corporate customers. However, the persistent high reliance on public sources, subdued access to markets, increased reliance on collateral and bail-in uncertainties, remain matters of concern. \tSignificant strategic and implementation challenges are looming ahead also in view of the entrance into force of the new regulatory framework. Some uncertainties also remain including on bail-in requirements. In addition, the banking sector is facing a fragmentation of the single market, which hardens the sovereign-bank linkage, and affects cross-border interbank markets. \tA number of detrimental business practices of EU banks have also affected consumer confidence and, therefore, increased reputational risks linked to the relationship between banks and consumers. More recent episodes of inappropriate conduct include mis-selling of products, failures with regard to rate benchmark setting and taxation issues. This will require heightened supervisory oversight and improvements in institutions' risk management functions, compliance procedures and risk culture. \t\u00a0 Report July 2013:\u00a0 Flip book | PDF ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-report-on-risks-and-vulnerabilities-of-the-eu-banking-sector"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1345", "date": "2013-07-15", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA presents data on high earners in EU banks", "text": " The EBA published today a report featuring data on the remuneration of EU bank staff who received one million Euro or more in total in 2010 and 2011.

He also spoke about the emergence of a new paradigm on transparency and fairness towards consumers. \"In order to regain trust and confidence by consumers, financial institutions need to develop simpler and more understandable products, devote further attention to the fairness of contractual conditions and definitely they need to review the charges and commissions applied ensuring that they are not disproportionate\", he said. \tDuring the panel discussion on PRIPs (proposal for a \u2018Regulation on key information documents for investment products') participants discussed the scope of the proposal together with considerations as to personalise the so-called Key Information Document enabling comparison between covered products (e.g. by including national information on tax implications). The importance of behavioural finance in product disclosure was also addressed and views were shared on which kind of information consumers generally need in order to take informed decisions on whether to buy or not to buy a product. \tDifferent break-out sessions on consumer trends, sales incentives and product intervention were held. \tIn this respect, the panellists discussing consumer trends, agreed that the ESAs need enhanced data collection powers to ensure data of quality with a view to\u00a0 continuously collect, analyse and report on consumer trends. The usefulness of comparison websites and payment protection instruments, two current trends in some of the financial sectors, was highlighted whilst focus was given to the consumer detriment also surrounding these types of distribution channels and instruments.\u00a0\u00a0 \tOn the topic of sales incentives, it was felt that in order to avoid mis-selling of financial products, several changes in sales culture are urgently required. \tOn product intervention, participants debated whether these powers would have the most value as a \u2018threat' in influencing firms to act in the best interests of their clients, and that product intervention should be seen in the round, as part of product design, product governance, and product distribution in order to address consumer protection issues before and up to point of sale, rather than playing catch-up after products hit the market.\u00a0 \tSummarising the panel discussions, Andrea Enria, Chairman of EBA, said: \"Today's conference has stimulated a lively and fruitful discussion. The ESAs will continue to join forces to identify cross-cutting issues and to address them jointly to the benefit of consumers across the EU\". Steven Maijoor, Chairman of ESMA, in his closing remarks, indicated: \"Whilst the financial crisis is mainly a stability crisis, and the regulatory response has been focussed on stability issues, we must not lose sight of our mandate, at European level, to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a high level of consumer protection. But delivering on protecting consumers' needs buy-in from industry (and consumers) too. \t\"It is not all about regulation, supervision and enforcement.

In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering.\u00a0In addition to being a forum for cooperation, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).

Against this backdrop, the EBA adopted the two Opinions on good practices to ensure that potential risks associated with mortgage lending and with borrowers in mortgage payment difficulties are managed adequately by credit institutions, and to contribute to the development of consistent practices in this area. \tIn particular, the Opinion on responsible mortgage lending sets out good practices on the following aspects: \t\tVerification of information provided by the mortgage applicant; \t\tReasonable debt service coverage; \t\tAppropriate loan-to-value ratios; and \t\tLending and supervisory processes. \tThe Opinion on the treatment of borrowers in mortgage payment difficulties, in turn, sets out good practices on the following aspects: \t\tGeneral principles; \t\tPolicies and procedures; \t\tProvision of information and assistance to the borrower; and \t\tResolution process. \tThe two Opinions complement, and provide suggestions on how to give effect to, the related provisions expected to be set out in the pending EU Directive on Credit Agreements Relating to Residential Property (also known as Mortgage Credit Directive). \tThe evidence underlying the two Opinions is based on a survey conducted by the EBA on national supervisory as well as more general market practices across the EU related to both, responsible lending and the treatment of borrowers in payment difficulty. Also, the good practices set out in the Opinion on responsible lending are based on the Principles for Sound Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices identified by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). \tBoth Opinions relate to mortgage credit. However, to minimise the risk of regulatory arbitrage, the authorities will want to consider the widest application of these good practices to other forms of non-mortgage credit, consistent with their respective scope of supervisory responsibility. \t\u00a0 \tNotes to editors The EBA is an independent EU Authority established on 1 January 2011. It works closely with the other European Supervisory Authorities responsible for securities and markets (ESMA), and insurance and occupational pensions (EIOPA), and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). The EBA's mission is to ensure an effective and consistent level of prudential regulation and supervision across the European banking sector.\u00a0 One of the EBA's key tasks is to contribute to the creation of the European Single Rulebook in banking, i.e. a single set of harmonised prudential rules for financial institutions throughout the EU which help create a level playing field and provide high protection to depositors, investors and consumers.

These Principles reflect the wider work being carried out on benchmarks and their immediate adoption will help restore confidence in financial benchmarks and prepare the way for future legislative change.\" \tAndrea Enria, EBA Chair, said: \t\"The EBA and ESMA believe that these Principles represent a sound interim solution for benchmark providers and users, ensuring that these important market indices are produced in a transparent and reliable manner.\u00a0 We are also continuing our review of the implementation of the Euribor recommendations by the European Banking Federation and aim to publish this in due course.\" \tESMA and the EBA have co-ordinated their work with current initiatives underway at EU, Member State and international level and have worked toward aligning the Principles with those being developed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). \tFurther to comments received during the consultation process, modifications were made to the proposed Principles to address: Continuity \u2013 inclusion of a Principle for the continuity of benchmarks in order to ensure that contingency provisions are in place if the continuity of a benchmark is at risk; and Liquidity requirements \u2013 the data used to construct a benchmark should represent accurately and reliably the underlying assets or prices, interest rates or other values measured by the benchmark and should be based on observable transactions entered into at arm's length. \tPrinciples on Benchmark-Setting Processes in the EU \tThe Principles provide a general framework covering all stages of the benchmarks setting process including data submission, administration, calculation, publication, the use of benchmarks and the continuity of benchmarks. \tA framework for any benchmark setting process should at least include the Principles set out below in order to instil confidence in financial markets and market participants, and guarantee the necessary accuracy and integrity of the benchmark formation process: \tGeneral framework for Benchmark setting \t\tMethodology: the methodologies for the calculation of a benchmark, including information on the way in which contributions are determined and corroborated, should be documented and be subject to regular scrutiny and controls to verify their reliability; \t\tGovernance structure: the process of setting a benchmark needs to be governed by clear and independent procedures, with detailed information on the process made available publicly, in order to avoid and manage conflicts of interest and limit its susceptibility to manipulation, discretionary decision making or price distortion; \t\tSupervision and oversight: confidence in a benchmark is enhanced through regulation and oversight and an appropriate sanctioning regime that allows sanctions for improper conduct, as it will be the case in accordance with future EU legislation on market abuse; and \t\tTransparency: a benchmark should be transparent and accessible to the public, with fair and open access to the rules governing its establishment and operation, calculation, and publication; the fact that a benchmark is (or may be) published first to certain stakeholders before it is to others should be disclosed. \tPrinciples for Benchmark Administrators \t\tA benchmark administrator should ensure the existence of robust methodologies for the calculation of the Benchmark and appropriately oversee its operations and ensure that there is an appropriate level of transparency to the public regarding the rules governing the Benchmark. \tPrinciples for Benchmark Submitters \t\tA benchmark submitter should have in place internal policies covering the submission process, governance, systems, training, record keeping, compliance, internal controls, audit and disciplinary procedures, including complaints management and escalation processes. \t\tA benchmark submitter should maintain and operate effective organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to avoid and manage conflicts of interests from affecting the Benchmark data submitted. \tPrinciples for Benchmark Calculation Agents \t\tA benchmark calculation agent should ensure a robust calculation of the benchmark and ensure the existence of appropriate internal controls over the benchmark calculations it makes. \tPrinciples for Benchmark Publishers \t\tA benchmark publisher should ensure reliable publication of the benchmark it has agreed to publish. \tPrinciples for Benchmark Users \t\tBenchmark users should regularly assess the benchmarks they use in financial products or transactions and verify that the benchmark used is appropriate, suitable and relevant for the targeted market. Any potential irregularities observed in a benchmark should be notified to the benchmark administrator or the relevant Supervisory Authorities if appropriate. \tPrinciples for the continuity of benchmarks \t\tAll those participating in the benchmark setting process and, where relevant, benchmark users should put in place robust and credible contingency provisions for cases in which there is a risk to the continuity of the provision of a benchmark due to, for example, a drying-up of market liquidity, an operational failure, a lack of submissions, transactions or quotes or the unavailability of the benchmark. \tAny change to a benchmark framework (calculation methodologies and procedures) should be managed in such a manner as to ensure that any disruption to existing benchmark-referenced contracts are proportionate and minimised. \tNotes for editors \t1.

The consultation runs until 23 August 2013. \tAlthough these Guidelines address FX lending to unhedged borrowers, their focus is on prudential requirements and not on consumer protection elements of FX lending. However, they indirectly contribute to consumer protection by potentially making FX lending more costly in terms of capital and, therefore, reducing the likelihood of unaffordable borrowing in the system. \tThe first part of the Guidelines defines the subject matter and the scope and sets out the process to be followed. In particular, a materiality threshold is introduced and in case it is exceeded, competent authorities should review the risk as part of the SREP. Competent authorities can still apply these guidelines where the risk is under the threshold but is deemed to be material. \tThe second part of the document provides guidance on the supervisory review of FX lending governance arrangements and of capital adequacy as well as on how to calculate capital add-on as a result of the SREP.

The consultation of both draft RTS runs until 31 August 2013. Draft RTS on the definition of market \tThe term market has to be defined for the purpose of calculating the general market risk component for equities under the standardised rules, thus assuming that two equities in the same market are subject to the same general risk. \tIn these draft RTS, the EBA is consulting on two definitions of market based on the two following criteria: nationality and currency. \tThe nationality criterion is based on the assumption that the \u2018general' risk stems from country-specific drivers. The currency criterion would, on the other hand, recognise that the introduction of a single currency in an already substantially integrated EU Single Market has blurred these country-specific drivers within the Euro-zone. \tUnder the pre-existing CRDII, most jurisdictions have already implemented the nationality approach via national transposition of the Directive. This approach is more conservative than the currency criterion in terms of capital requirements. However, the currency approach takes account of the growing integration of financial markets. \tThe EBA is requested to submit these draft RTS to the European Commission by 31 January 2014. Draft RTS on option risks under the standardised approach for market risk \tThese draft RTS aim at defining a range of methods to reflect, in the own funds requirements, all the risks, other than delta risk, in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options and warrants. \tThe EBA's proposal is broadly in line with the Basel II framework which provides for the three following methods: \t\ta simplified approach to be applied only by institutions that buy options \t\tthe delta-plus method that can be also applied by institutions that sell options \t\tthe scenario approach that is more sophisticated and addressed to institutions dealing with a considerable trading activity in options \tAlthough the EBA has agreed to refer to the treatment of option risk outlined in the Basel framework, these RTS deviate from Basel due to regulatory specificities included in the CRR or where the EBA has considered that the treatment in Basel was not specific enough. The three methods allowed in Basel are included in the paper, though some specific changes have been introduced. In addition, a fallback treatment for complex options is also proposed. \tFurthermore, these draft RTS consult on the possibility of allowing a combination of different methods within an institution or solely between separate legal entities within a group. \tThe EBA is requested to submit these draft RTS to the European Commission by 31 December 2013.

These material risk takers will be subject to specific provisions of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) related, in particular, to the payment of variable remuneration. The consultation runs until 21 August. \tThe EBA proposes an identification process based on a combination of standard qualitative and quantitative criteria and internal criteria developed by the institutions. The objective of this combined approach is to ensure an appropriate harmonisation and level playing field across the EU while taking into account each institution's risk profile. \tStaff shall be identified as material risk takers if they meet one or more of the following criteria: Standard qualitative criteria: related to the role and decision-making power of staff members (e.g. staff is a member of a management body, is a senior manager, has the authority to commit significantly to credit risk exposures, etc.) Standard quantitative criteria: related to the level of variable or total gross remuneration in absolute or in relative terms. In this respect, staff should be identified as material risk takers if: \t(i) their total remuneration exceeds, in absolute terms, EUR 500 000 per year, or \t(ii) they are included in the 0.3 % of staff with the highest remuneration in the institution, or \t(iii) their remuneration bracket is equal or greater than the lowest total remuneration of senior management and other risk takers, or \t(iv) their variable remuneration exceeds EUR 75 000 and 75% of the fixed component of remuneration.

The consultation runs until 16 August 2013. \tThe EBA's starting point in setting out the calculation methodology is to require institutions to take all the reasonable steps to look-through to the underlying assets and to identify the obligors of all credit risk exposures underlying the transaction. \tIn case an institution is not able to identify the obligors of underlying exposures, it is requested to add all these exposures to the same hypothetical \u2018unknown client' and the large exposures limit applies to the \u2018unknown client' in the same way it applies to any other single client. Therefore, all unknown exposures stemming from all transactions should be considered as a single risk and as one hypothetical \u2018unknown client'. \tAn important development compared to the \u2018CEBS Guidelines on the implementation of the revised large exposures regime' is the proposal for a more prudent treatment for securitisation positions whereby all tranches in a securitisation would be treated equally as if they were a first loss tranche and therefore fully exposed to the underlying assets. \tThe EBA is requested to submit these draft RTS to the European Commission by 1 January 2014.

While banks' capital positions were significantly strengthened under the EBA's recapitalisation exercise, the objective of the asset quality exercises will be to review banks' classifications and valuations of their assets so to help dispel concerns over the deterioration of asset quality due to macroeconomic conditions in Europe. \t\tSince appropriately reviewed balance sheets are a key input to an effective stress test, the EBA has also adjusted the timeline of the next EU-wide stress test so to conduct the exercise in 2014 once the asset quality reviews are completed. However, to ensure transparency and comparability over the years, the EBA will provide, in the second half of 2013, appropriate disclosure on the actual exposures of the EU banking sector. \t\tThe EBA underlines the importance of taking into account and supporting the work on the review of banks' assets and, in particular, of ensuring alignment in methodologies and timeline with the balance sheet assessment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) to be conducted under the aegis of the European Central Bank. \t\tIn this respect, the set of EBA recommendations and the timeframe for the asset quality reviews and the EU-wide stress test will be published once the timeline of the SSM's balance sheet assessment is known. \t\tAsset quality reviews remain under the responsibility of the relevant competent authorities and have already been undertaken in some jurisdictions. The EBA's recommendations will, therefore, aim at contributing to a more uniform approach in the methodology of the reviews, through a set of good practices, and to a consistent communication on the outcomes of national exercises. \t\tAndrea Enria, Chairperson of the European Banking Authority, said: \"Our recapitalisation recommendations have brought the common equity capital ratios of EU banks in line with those of major international competitors.

The events will lead to losses throughout the financial sector in Cyprus. However, the risks of direct international contagion seem to be limited. \tThe Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities (Joint Committee) has published today its first Report on Risks and Vulnerabilities in the European Union's (EU) Financial System. \tThe publication identifies the key cross-sectoral risks facing the EU's financial markets and system, and sets out recommendations on how these can be addressed through coordinated policy and supervisory action by policy-makers, the ESAs and Member States. \tThe report is the first of what will be a regular publication by the Joint Committee on cross-sectoral financial market risks in the EU. \tGabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA and current Chairman of the Joint Committee, said: \"Today's first report by the three European Supervisory Authorities has identified some key cross-sectoral risks facing the EU's financial system including, in particular, the risk of fragmentation, over-reliance on collateral, concerns with regard to the quality of financial institutions' assets, and the loss of confidence in institutions and benchmarks. This cross-sectoral work provides EU policy-makers and regulators with an overall view of the risks they face and moves us away from a narrow sectoral approach, and the inherent risk of failing to see the big picture\". Risks \tThe report has identified the following risks the EU financial system is facing: \t\u00a0 \t\tWeak macroeconomic outlook and consequently a deterioration for financial institutions' asset quality and profitability; \t\tLow interest rate environment; \t\tRisk of further fragmentation on the single market ; \t\tIncreased reliance on collateral; \t\tLack of confidence in financial institutions' balance sheet valuations and risk disclosure; and \t\tLoss of confidence in financial benchmarks. Recommendations \tIn light of the findings in the report, the Joint Committee believes that only a concerted response by policy-makers and EU Member States can restore the confidence and trust that has been eroded during the financial crisis. \tThe Joint Committee urges the EU political leaders to press ahead with the establishment of Banking Union, including the Single Supervisory Mechanism, and bank resolution schemes. In their turn, the ESAs remain committed to fostering supervisory convergence, amongst others, through a strong role in supervisory colleges and through the development of both the EU-wide Single Rulebook and Supervisory Handbooks. \tDuring the crisis, the ESAs have successfully facilitated on-going open communication among national authorities within supervisory colleges and ESA financial stability groups. This was only possible because of the trust that has been built up in recent years with the establishment and coordination of these groups. \tNote on the developments in Cyprus \tThe cut-off date for this report was 13 March 2013. Therefore, recent events in Cyprus are not discussed in the publication. The ESAs have closely monitored the situation in Cyprus as it has developed. The winding-down of Laiki Bank and the restructuring of Bank of Cyprus will lead to losses throughout the financial sector in Cyprus, but the risks of direct international contagion seem to be limited. So far, market conditions and deposit dynamics have remained relatively stable. Recent events manifest the risk of further fragmentation of the single market and underscore the need for closer coordination and integration, including in supervisory colleges, and through full implementation of the banking union.\u00a0 Notes for editors The Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1st January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely and ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition to being a forum for cooperation, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).

This exercise was run in parallel with the study conducted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) at a global level. \tThe report presents the aggregate results, as of 30 June 2012, on capital, risk weighted assets (RWAs) and leverage ratio assuming full implementation of the Basel III framework and a static balance sheet. The results of this study are not comparable to industry estimates as they do not include assumptions regarding banks' future profitability, changes in capital or balance sheet composition nor further management actions that could be taken in response to the new Basel framework. \tAgainst the backdrop of the aforementioned assumptions, this study shows that that the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1) of the largest European banks (Group 1 banks) would be on average 7.8% compared to a ratio of 11.1% under the current rules. Therefore, Group 1 banks would face a CET1 capital shortfall of \u20ac3.7 bn to achieve a minimum requirement of 4.5% and of \u20ac112.4 bn at a target level of 7.0%. \tCompared to the previous exercise based on data as of 31 December 2011, these results show a decrease in the capital shortfall of \u20ac86.2 bn (43.4%). This decrease is predominantly driven by an increase in CET1 capital rather than by a reduction in RWAs.

The first one is a description of the work done by the EBA, by other EU institutions and by the Member States to address the key issues in consumer protection in the EU banking sector which had been highlighted in the first survey of the national competent authorities. The second part focuses on a revised set of issues, trends and products for 2013 following a new survey conducted in the second quarter of 2012. \tWhile not claiming to present a comprehensive picture of all relevant risks or potentially harmful products from a consumer prospective, this report identifies six main consumer issues: \t\u00a0 \t\tIndebtedness and responsible credit; \t\tTransparency and levels of charges; \t\tScope of mis-selling of financial products resulting from a combination of pressures on institutions and the continuing challenges for consumers in understanding the suitability of products for them; \t\tSpecific issues concerning certain products \u2013 notably foreign currency loans, payment protection insurance and complex products; \t\tSecurity of new technologies used for banking services; \t\tEmerging new forms of liquidity raising. \tThese findings are not unexpected or fundamentally new as many of concerns identified also reflect macro-economic conditions which have remained challenging over the recent period and the consequent consumers' behaviours as well as those of some financial institutions in the EU banking sector.\u00a0 \tIn an attempt to address some of these issues, in 2012, some member states introduced additional requirements and new standards, and the EBA is currently working on identifying good practices on responsible lending and on the treatment of borrowers facing payment difficulties.

Notes to editors \t\t1.\u00a0The European Commission presented on 6 June 2012 a proposal for a Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (the so-called Recovery and Resolution Directive - RRD). The objective of the Directive is to ensure that in the future authorities will have the means to intervene decisively both before problems occur and early on in the process if they do (prevention and early intervention powers). Furthermore, if the financial situation of a bank deteriorates beyond repair, the proposal ensures that a bank's critical functions can be rescued while the costs of restructuring and resolving failing banks fall upon the bank's owners and creditors and not on taxpayers (resolution powers). \t\t2.\u00a0The EBA adopted on 23 January 2013 a formal Recommendation to ensure that major EU cross-border banks develop group recovery plans by the end of 2013. The plans shall be submitted to the respective competent authorities and discussed within colleges of supervisors. The aim of the Recommendation is to spur the development of recovery plans and to foster convergence on the highest standards across the Union. \t\t3.\u00a0These draft RTS are produced in accordance with Article 10 of the EBA regulation\u00a0and shall be finally adopted by the European Commission by means of regulations or decisions. According to EU law, EU regulations are binding in their entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. This means that, on the date of their entry into force, they become part of the national law of the Member States and their implementation into national law is not only unnecessary but also prohibited by EU law, except in so far as this is expressly required by them.

In this respect, the EBA is already working to enhance disclosure in general, and in particular on RWAs. This would allow for a better comparison by third parties, thus increasing confidence in the IRB approach. Some of the A-type differences appear to be driven by potentially different supervisory practices that may require further investigation and possibly supervisory measures to foster convergence. \tThe analysis of the B-type differences, which may also be caused by a different interpretation and practical application of the regulation, is not the scope of this report as it requires further data. \t\u00a0To shed more light on the B-type differences, which appear mainly in the corporate and retail portfolios, and to be able to draw some conclusions on the A-type differences, more granular \"bottom up\" exercises based on specific data requests from banks are needed. This would allow to combine a quantitative analysis with a qualitative understanding of the underlying data. \tWork is currently underway on two bottom-up steps of the analysis on banking book exposures. These analyses which are expected to be achieved by the end of 2013, include: \t-\u00a0an investigation of the low default portfolio exposures; \t-\u00a0an ad-hoc review of SMEs and residential mortgage exposures. \tCommenting on this analysis, Andrea Enria, Chairperson of the EBA, said \"Thanks to this preliminary analysis, we identified some explanatory drivers of RWA differences across banks. Greater disclosure could, therefore, go some way to appease the concerns raised by investors and market analysts on the reliability of banks' RWAs. But this is not enough. The remaining dispersion is significant and calls for further investigations and possibly policy solutions. We are strongly committed to deepening this analysis to ensure RWAs are seen and understood as reliable and consistent across banks, reflecting their true risk profile\". EBA wider analysis on the consistency of risk weighted assets across European banks \tThe work currently undertaken on the banking book exposures is part of a wider analysis on the consistency of RWAs conducted by the EBA. \tIn this respect, the EBA is planning to: \t\tconduct interviews with the banks and the supervisors in to complement the bottom-up exercises and to detect inconsistent practices; \t\tperform a review of the Pillar 3 disclosures on RWAs; \t\tcarry out an assessment of the trading book exposures by the end of 2013. \tThe overall results of the review on RWAs will inform the work the EBA is conducting in parallel on the validation of internal models, which will also contribute to harmonising supervisory and banks' practices and to enhancing consistency.

The first step will involve the assessment of a range of asset classes against the fundamental definitions of liquid assets included in the draft Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). A detailed quantitative assessment of the liquidity of individual assets will then be performed, with the objective of producing a ranking of the relative liquidity of the different asset classes. Finally, the analysis will identify the features that are of particular importance to market liquidity. The objective of this last step is to provide definitions of the characteristics assets should have to be qualified as highly, or extremely highly liquid. \t\tThe draft CRR text stipulates that the EU Commission will adopt a delegated act by 30 June 2014 to implement the LCR in EU regulation.

Notes to editors \t\t1.\u00a0In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) announced the introduction of a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), to be put in place in 2015 and 2018 respectively. The LCR promotes short-term resilience of a bank's liquidity risk profile by ensuring that it has sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to survive a significant stress scenario lasting for one month. The NSFR has a time horizon of one year and has been developed to provide a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities. Subsequently, in January 2013 the Basel Committee announced an updated LCR, with subsequent discussions of the 2010 text having led to some substantive revisions to the scope of HQLA and to the implementation timetable of the standard (phased from 2015 to 2019). \t\t2.\u00a0The CRR/CRD IV package (the so-called Capital Requirements Regulation - \u2018CRR'- and the so-called Capital Requirements Directive \u2013 \u2018CRD') translates into European law international standards on bank capital agreed at the G20 level (most commonly known as the Basel III agreement). One of the major achievements will be the creation of a Single Rule Book - a set of rules directly applicable in all EU member states - that will improve both transparency and enforcement in the EU banking sector. This includes the incorporation of the above-mentioned Basel requirements regarding liquidity into the new EU regulatory framework taking into account European specificities. \t\t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/eba-consults-on-the-process-to-define-highly-liquid-assets-in-the-liquidity-coverage-ratio-lcr-"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1394", "date": "2013-02-20", "text_type": "PR", "title": "Andrea Enria's Lectio Magistralis at the University of Trento", "text": " \t\tThe Chairperson of the European Banking Authority, Andrea Enria, gave today a\u00a0Lectio Magistralis at the University of Trento on\"The crisis in Europe, the impact on banks and the authorities' response\". \t\t\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/andrea-enria-s-lectio-magistralis-at-the-university-of-trento"}, {"id": "EBA_NEWS_1395", "date": "2013-01-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Public Hearing on the consultation paper on Principles for Benchmarks-Setting Processes in the EU", "text": " \tFollowing the publication of the consultation paper on Principles for Benchmarks-Setting Processes in the EU, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) are organising a public hearing at ESMA's premises in Paris on Wednesday, 13 February 2013 (14:30 - 17:30).\u00a0 \tTo facilitate the discussion, ESMA and the EBA have outlined a series of questions on which they are particularly interested in receiving input from interested stakeholders.

The expansion in scope is designed to ensure that the data set is representative of the European banking sector, and to ensure that it fully reflects the diversity of the sector in each Member State. The data collection under this voluntary exercise is based on the templates used by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) for its monitoring exercise, which have been adapted to accommodate European specificities. \tAccording to the draft text of the CRR, the EBA needs to report to the European Commission on the possible impact of the liquidity coverage requirement for the first time by 30 September 2013 and subsequently annually. Next steps \tIn addition to the present package, the EBA will be launching a consultation on the data point model for leverage and liquidity reporting in the first quarter of 2013. \tAs soon as\u00a0 the CRR text is finalised, the EBA will publish a final draft ITS (comprising the legal text of the draft ITS, as well as templates and instructions updated on the basis of the final CRR text). It is currently expected that limited changes will be introduced to these templates and instructions, primarily to reflect the final wording and definitions in the CRR. \tAs already communicated by the EBA in July 2012 for the standards on supervisory reporting, the EBA acknowledges that a longer time period may be needed, after the entry into force of the CRR, to prepare some of the reporting systems. Nevertheless, given the material which the EBA is publishing today, it is expected that not more than one year will be needed to implement the new reporting provisions. In order to provide certainty to institutions, the EBA envisages that the first remittance dates will fall in the first quarter of 2014 for the full ITS requirements on liquidity and leverage. Note to the editors \tThe legal basis for the development by the EBA of these two draft ITS can be found in the draft CRR. This forms part of a package of legislative proposals adopted by the European Commission (EC) in July 2011 and which is currently being negotiated among the EU institutions in the context of the so-called \u2018Trilogue' discussions, as part of the process for its final adoption by the EU legislators, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.

These RTS will also cover the analysis of the costs and benefits that the legal requirements will imply. Background and process \tArticles 31 and 100 of the fifth Council compromise version text from 11 May 2012 (the latest available version) of the draft CRR require institutions to apply prudent valuation standards to all positions that are measured at fair value when calculating the amount of their own funds. Any additional value adjustments necessary to reduce the fair value of those positions to the relevant prudent value, as calculated in accordance with the relevant accounting standards, should be deducted from common equity tier 1 capital. \tThe draft CRR mandates the EBA with the task of developing RTS to provide more details on how the standards set out in Article 100 should be applied. In particular, Article 100 lays out a number of valuation adjustments that should be considered when calculating a prudent valuation. The intended effect of these adjustments is to set valuations at a level that achieves an appropriate degree of certainty that the valuation used for regulatory purposes is not higher than the true realisable value. With this aim in mind, this paper considers the possibility of defining what the \u2018appropriate degree of certainty' or level of confidence is that the requirements wish to achieve in the adjusted valuation. \t\u00a0 Consultation process \tThe EBA invites comments on the issues raised in this discussion paper (DP). \tAll interested stakeholders are requested to send their comments to the EBA by e-mail to DP-2012-03@eba.europa.eu by 13 January 2013, including the reference to \u2018EBA/DP/2012/3' in the subject field.

The report also includes proposals for alternative measures to be taken to create the right incentives to SME lending. This report was submitted to the European Commission in September 2012. \tBased on Supervisory Authorities' data and Balance Sheet Central Banks data, the EBA's assessment concludes that a great caution should be exercised in altering the RWs or the threshold for SME Retail exposures to avoid any risk of jeopardising financial stability. However, the EBA, while understanding the SME financing constraints in Europe, would advise to consider alternative measures to provide the same capital alleviation, such as the introduction of a supporting discount, which would not act on RWs, but would be applied at the end of the process of capital calculation. These measures should be applied only to SME\u00a0 exposures and not to the whole Retail exposure class. Content of the report \tThe EBA's assessment report includes: \t\tAn illustration of the financial constraints of SMEs, which have triggered several calls for action, also in the area of banking regulation (section 1). \t\tAn overview of the proposals included the CRD IV/CRR framework regarding SMEs, comparing them with the current regime (section 2) and providing its evaluation (sections 3 to 6) \t\tFurther aspects of the proposals: its impact, consequences on financial stability and the effectiveness of the measures (sections 7 to 9). \t\tFinally, it touches upon some other regulatory measures, which could be more promising and effective for SMEs' access to finance (section 10). Background and EBA mandate \tThe EU Commission's CRD IV/CRR legislative proposal foresees an overall increase in capital requirements and also a higher quality of own funds with the view of strengthening the regulation of the banking sector and ultimately of creating a sounder and safer financial system. \tThe introduction of the so-called capital conservation buffer (2.5% of risk-weighted assets, in addition to the current 8% requirement) could potentially impact on SME lending. This measure, which will be phased in from 2016 to 2019, has raised the concerns of the SMEs sector, which argued that this requirement should be neutralised for SME exposures. \tIn July 2011 the European Commission mandated the European Banking Authority (EBA) to analyse the appropriateness of the current risk weights (RWs) of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending, testing the possibilities for a scenario of a reduction by one third in relation to the current regulation and the impact of this on banking credit and the soundness of the financial system. Additionally, the EBA should analyse the impact of an increase from EUR 1 million to EUR 5 million on the regulatory thresholds for SMEs.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/report-on-the-assessment-of-sme-proposals-for-crd-iv-crr"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1414", "date": "2012-10-18", "text_type": "PR", "title": "Keynote speech by Andrea Enria at the NBP's Conference in Warsaw", "text": " \tAndrea Enria, Chairperson of the EBA, gave a speech today in Warsaw at the Annual National Bank of Poland's Conference \"A Reconfiguration of Europe - the CEE Perspective\" on: Deleveraging and segmentation of the Single Market.

Overall, the EBA welcomes efforts made by banks to improve their disclosure practices and to comply with the new requirements introduced with CRD3. Nevertheless, the report notes that there is still room for improvements in Banks' Pillar 3 disclosures, and the EBA intends to continue to press for such improvements. Main findings \t\tWeaknesses remain in the areas of banks disclosures of credit risk \u2013 on Internal Ratings Based approaches (IRB) and securitisation activities \u2013 and market risk. The introduction of new disclosure requirements in CRD 3 in particular in the areas of securitisation and market risk may explain some of the weaknesses identified. But the EBA has also noted that weaknesses already identified in its previous assessments remain and calls for further action. \t\tBeyond assessing compliance with CRD disclosures requirements, the EBA has also performed an analysis of banks' Basel III implementation disclosures, in particular as regards the impact on own funds, and of the 2011 EBA Capital Exercise related disclosures. Information provided by credit institutions in these two areas were found to be of varying quality. \t\tIn all disclosure areas, the EBA has identified some best practices which credit institutions are encouraged to follow, in order to enhance the general quality of Pillar 3 information. With a view of both facilitating compliance with the requirements as well as enhancing the quality and comparability of disclosures, the EBA will this year supplement information on best practices with further explanations on the objective and content of the disclosure requirements, which banks are also encouraged to consider while preparing their Pillar 3 disclosures. \t\tSome improvements in the quality of disclosures were noted in the area of remuneration and own funds. On the latter, credit institutions provided appropriate details of capital items and a meaningful breakdown of deductions. \t\tWith regards to the timing, formats or verification of disclosures, no significant changes have been made in banks' practices of reporting Pillar 3 information. However, information was generally published nearer to the reporting date of banks' annual accounts and annual report but the EBA will still push for publication of these reports at the same time to allow investors to have the complete set of publicly available information at once. Next steps \t\tBased on the findings and content of this report, the EBA, throughout 2012 and in 2013, plans to implement a strategy for enhanced transparency and to that end will i) keep on identifying best practices of public disclosures in the publications as well as the CRD requirements for which compliance has to be improved and ii) will work on these improvements, including in the area of comparability of disclosures. In this respect, the EBA will consult and engage with the industry and users where it is needed. Background \t\tThe analysis, carried out in 2012 and covering a sample of nineteen European banks, focussed mainly on those areas where the need for improvement had already been identified in previous assessments as well as on areas where new disclosure requirements have been introduced with CRD3. The conclusions of this review will serve as essential input for defining and developing the EBA's strategy in enhancing the area of transparency.

Overall, the exercise led to an increase of banks' capital positions of more than \u20ac200bn. 27 banks with an initial shortfall that submitted capital plans have strengthened their capital position by \u20ac116bn. Considering the still challenging market environment, the EBA's Board of Supervisors underlined the need for banks to maintain their capital levels in view of the implementation of the new regulatory framework. In this respect, the EBA will adopt a new Recommendation on capital conservation once the final CRD IV/CRR text is agreed. \t\tAndrea Enria, Chairperson of the European Banking Authority said: \"European banks have made significant progress in boosting their capital positions and in strengthening the overall resilience of the European banking system. With this recapitalisation exercise and a number of other EU-driven remedial actions, more than \u20ac200bn has been injected into the European banking system.\" He added: \"Banks are now in a better shape to finance the real economy but must continue on the path designed by the new regulatory environment. For this reason, the EBA will ask banks to draw up capital plans to ensure a smooth convergence to the upcoming CRD IV/CRR requirements\" Final report on the Capital exercise \t\tThe report on banks' measures taken to comply with the EBA Recommendation highlights the following: \t\t\tFor the 27 banks which were requested to submit capital plans, the exercise resulted in an aggregate amount of \u20ac116bn. \t\t\tOverall, taking into account the capital strengthening of the remaining banks in the sample, and the capital injection already realised in Greek banks and in one Spanish bank involved in the exercise, more than \u20ac200bn have been injected between December 2011 and June 2012. \t\t\tBanks' capital strengthening has been achieved mainly via new capital measures such as retained earnings, new equity and liability management. \t\t\tFor the banks which did not manage to meet the Recommendation using private sources, public backstops have been or will be implemented by the end of 2012, in some cases, with EU and/or international support. In this respect, the EBA remains involved in the asset quality reviews and capital needs assessment currently being undertaken in Spain and Cyprus. \t\t\tIn line with the Recommendation, capital strengthening has not led directly to a significant reduction in lending into the real economy. A deleveraging process had already started before the capital exercise and will need to continue in an orderly fashion to ensure long term repair of banks' balance sheets. \t\t\t\u00a0 Next steps and transition to the new CRD IV framework \t\tDespite the positive outcome of the recapitalisation process, the market environment remains challenging. Additional efforts by banks are also required to meet the full CRD IV/CRR implementation, as shown by the recently published EBA Basel III monitoring report. \t\tTherefore, the EBA decided that, once the new legal setting is adopted at EU level, a new Recommendation will be issued and will focus on capital conservation. Its aim will be to ensure that banks do not make strategic use of the capital accumulated in the last year, so as to be able to absorb unexpected losses and to support a smooth convergence to the CRD IV/CRR regulatory requirements. \t\tThis new EBA Recommendation will require banks to maintain an absolute amount of CT1 capital corresponding to the level of 9% Core Tier One ratio at the end of June 2012. However, in specific cases, such as restructuring plans or de-risking, a bank may be allowed to go below the required amount of capital. \t\tBanks will be asked to develop appropriate capital plans charting their pathway to CRD IV/CRR implementation. Those plans will be monitored by National supervisors in cooperation with the EBA and within colleges of supervisors. \t\tDividend distribution and other variable payments will be constrained for banks that would not be able to respect their plans in normal time and under stressed conditions. \t\tThe sovereign component of the capital buffers remains in force at September 2011 level until withdrawn and will be considered separately depending on the market environment. Disclosure of individual banks data \t\tTogether with the final report and to ensure a high level of transparency of the EU banking sector, the EBA publishes additional data provided by banks from their 30 June 2012 financial statements. The data disclosed include: capital composition and risk weighted assets and the sovereign exposures as of December 2011 and June 2012. Note for editors \t\t\tThe EBA Recommendation on the creation of temporary capital buffers to restore market confidence was adopted by the Board of Supervisors on 8 December 2011 to address the difficult situation in the EU banking system, especially with regard to the sovereign exposures, by restoring stability and confidence in the markets. The Recommendation called on National Authorities to require banks included in the sample to strengthen their capital positions by building up an exceptional and temporary capital buffer against sovereign debt exposures to reflect market prices as at the end of September 2011. In addition, banks were required to establish an exceptional and temporary buffer such that the Core Tier 1 capital ratio reaches a level of 9% by the end of June 2012. \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\u00a0 \t\t\tThe initial sample of the Capital Exercise included 71 banks. However, the 6 Greek banks were treated separately as the country is currently under an EU/IMF assistance programme. Moreover, four banks (\u00d6esterreichische Volksbank AG, Dexia, WestLB AG and Bankia) from the original sample have been identified as undergoing a significant restructuring process, and are being monitored separately. Therefore, the individual data published today refers to 61 banks. \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\u00a0 \t\t\tOn 27 September 2012, the EBA published its second report of the Basel III monitoring which presents the aggregate results on capital, risk-weighted assets (RWAs), leverage and liquidity ratios in EU member states.

Methodology \tThis report is based on data as of 31 December 2011 and for the first time shows the evolution of Basel III ratios over time. In this regard, a total of 156 banks, which reported data for all three periods, have been included in the sample. Banks submitted comprehensive and detailed non-public data on a voluntary and best-efforts basis. National supervisors worked extensively with banks to ensure data quality, completeness and consistency with the published reporting instructions. \tThis exercise is carried out assuming full implementation of Basel III and its results are compared with the respective current national implementation of the Basel II.5 framework. \tThe monitoring exercise provides an impact assessment of the following aspects: \t\u2022\u00a0Changes to banks\u201f capital ratios under Basel III, and estimates of any capital shortfalls. In addition, estimates of capital surcharges for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are included, where applicable; \t\u2022\u00a0Changes to the definition of capital that result from the new capital standard, referred to as common equity Tier 1 (CET1), including modified rules on capital deductions, and changes to the eligibility criteria for Tier 1 and total capital; \t\u2022\u00a0Changes in the calculation of risk-weighted assets (RWA) resulting from changes to the definition of capital and counterparty credit risk requirements; \t\u2022\u00a0The capital conservation buffer; \t\u2022\u00a0The leverage ratio; \t\u2022\u00a0Two liquidity standards \u2013 the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). Background \tSince the new EU directive and regulation are not finalised yet, no EU specific rules are analysed in this report. It is important to note that the monitoring exercise is based on static balance sheet assumptions. Planned management actions to increase capital or decrease risk-weighted assets are not taken into account. This allows for identifying effective changes in banks\u201f capital base instead of identifying changes which are solely based on changes in underlying modelling assumptions As a consequence, monitoring results are not comparable to industry estimates as the latter usually include assumptions on banks' future profitability, planned capital and/or further management actions that mitigate the impact of Basel III. In addition, monitoring results are not comparable to \"Comprehensive Quantitative Impact Study\" (C-QIS) results, which assessed the impact of policy proposals published in 2009 that differed significantly from the final Basel III framework. \tFor the purpose of this monitoring exercise, participating banks were classified into two groups: Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 banks (44 from 14 EU countries) are those with a Tier 1 capital in excess of \u20ac3 bn and internationally active whereas all other banks in the sample fall into Group 2 (112 banks from 17 EU countries).

The draft standards will now be sent to the European Commission for their adoption. The EBA also adopted an Opinion on the same topic. \tMain features of the draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) \tThe draft regulatory technical standards (draft RTS) were developed by the EBA aim at specifying the requirements expressed in the EMIR Regulation (Regulation on OTC derivative transactions, central counterparties and trade repositories) regarding the capital of a CCP. \tThe draft RTS provide that a CCP should hold capital, including retained earnings and reserves, that is at all times at least equal to the sum of: \t\tthe CCP's gross operational expenses during an appropriate time span for winding down or restructuring its activities; \t\tthe capital necessary to cover the overall operational and legal risks; \t\tthe capital necessary to cover credit, counterparty credit and market risks not covered by specific financial resources;\u00a0 \t\tthe capital necessary to cover business risk. Since the level of business risk is highly dependent on the individual situation of each CCP, the capital requirement should be based on a CCP\u201fs own estimate subject to the approval of the competent authority. \tFurthermore, a floor needs to be introduced in order to ensure a prudent level playing field for the capital requirements of a CCP.\u00a0 Next steps \tThe draft RTS will now be sent to the European Commission (EC) who shall decide whether to endorse it within 3 months. Following an eventual endorsement by the EC, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU may object to the regulatory technical standards before it enters into force. \t\u00a0 \tThe standards will have the legal form of a Regulation and will be directly applicable across the European Union. They will be published in the EU Official Journal and translated in all EU official languages. Opinion \tThe European Banking Authority also adopted an opinion in order to raise awareness of the European Commission regarding market developments and supervisory practices which should be taken into consideration for a future review of the EMIR Regulation. \tIn this respect, it is the EBA's view that competent authorities should be allowed to apply to a CCP an additional capital charge in order to mitigate risks which may arise from situations not covered by the EMIR, such as reputational risk or other risks that may arise from the economic or business environment. This approach would be similar to the Pillar 2 approach applied to credit institutions.\u00a0 \tThe EBA also suggests that intraday credit risk is properly set either within the EMIR framework or with the proposal of a special regulation by the EU-COM. In addition, it is the EBA's view that the interoperability arrangements other than for cash products should be properly set out in the EMIR text. Notes to the editors \t(1)\u00a0The Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on OTC derivative transactions, central counterparties and trade repositories, known as EMIR, lays out provisions with the view to increasing the safety and transparency of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. It introduces a legal obligation to clear OTC derivatives transactions through central counterparties (CCPs) and establishes organisational, conduct of business and prudential requirements for CCPs to ensure that these institutions are robustly risk-managed and financially sound, irrespective of the financial instruments cleared. The Regulation requires CCPs to collect margins, to maintain a pre-funded default fund and to maintain dedicated own resources to cover their losses upon the default of one of their clearing members. Additional capital is also required under the EMIR to mitigate, on the one hand, against market risk, credit risk and counterparty credit risk arising from non-covered activities and, on the other hand, against operational risk arising from all activities of a CCP. \t(2)\u00a0As foreseen in Article 10 of the EBA regulation Draft RTS are produced in response to mandates provided to the EBA by sectoral legislation. They must and must be subsequently endorsed by the European Commission by means of regulations or decisions. Following an eventual endorsement by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU may object to the regulatory technical standards according to Article 13 of the EBA founding regulation. According to EU law, EU regulations are binding in their entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. This means that, on the date of their entry into force, they become part of the national law of the Member States and their implementation into national law is not only unnecessary but also prohibited by EU law, except in so far as this is expressly required.

Therefore, financial institutions may face challenges to immediately comply with all the reporting requirements included in the ITS. To address those challenges, some flexibility will need to be given through phase-in provisions or on the implementation date of the new requirements. \t\tSimilar practical provisions for phase-in arrangements or elements of flexibility may be considered in the implementation of other technical standards on a case-by-case basis and depending on the final date of entry into force of the CRD IV/CRR package. Timeline of implementation for the ITS on Reporting \t\tMost respondents to the EBA's consultation on the reporting ITS (Consultation paper CP50 published on 20 December 2011) \u2013 in particular those located in jurisdictions where COREP and FINREP guidelines have not been implemented - stressed that the time to implement the full ITS requirements would not be sufficient as relevant IT systems would need to be changed before the first submission of data to competent authorities. \t\tAs competent authorities have the obligation to check institutions' compliance with the new regulatory framework as of the date of application of the CRR, the submission of relevant data needs to be aligned with the Regulation requirements. Therefore institutions will need to comply with CRR requirements as of its application date (currently foreseen 1 January 2013) and will need to adapt their systems beforehand. \t\tHowever, a phase-in of data items not directly used to assess compliance with specific CRR requirements is seen as a solution for easing the implementation burden while safeguarding tasks to be performed by competent authorities. \t\tAreas identified as being the most burdensome for financial institutions are among those which could apply at a later stage. In particular, the EBA acknowledges that a longer time period may be needed, after the entry into force of the CRR currently foreseen 1 January 2013, to prepare some of the reporting systems. Therefore, the implementation date of the full ITS requirements related to financial information (FINREP) should be set to 1 January 2014, providing sufficient time for implementation. Decisions regarding the phase-in of other data requirements may be taken once final CRR provisions are available. Next steps \t\tAs soon as the final CRR text is available, the EBA will finalise the draft ITS, taking into account possible changes in the scope of the CRR reporting requirements, and submit it to the Commission for endorsement. \t\tA workshop for technical experts working on the implementation of the new reporting requirements will be organised by the EBA on 13 September 2012 with a view to receive additional feedback on revised data definitions.

In line with the EBA's Recommendation, the vast majority of the banks in the sample meet the required ratio of 9% Core Tier 1 (CT1). For the few banks that were not fully able to meet the capital level using private sources, backstop measures are currently being implemented to ensure they are in line with the EBA's Recommendation. While the market environments remain challenging, the overall resilience of the European banking system has improved, without any significant adverse impact on lending into the real economy. \t\tAndrea Enria, Chairperson of the European Banking Authority said: \"Our work in strengthening the capital base of banks is proceeding to plan. European banks are now in a stronger position, which should support lending to the real economy and gradually restore banks' access to market funding. Significant challenges remain to exit the crisis and comply with the new regulatory standards approved by the G20, but this was a necessary and important step in the process of repairing banks' balance sheets across the EU\". \t\tThe overview of banks' measures taken to establish capital buffers so as to achieve a CT1 ratio of 9% after prudent valuation of sovereign exposures highlights the following: \t\t\tThe exercise led to an aggregate \u20ac94.4bn recapitalisation for 27 banks \u2013 largely exceeding the \u20ac76bn shortfall identified in December - and to a significant restructuring of the remaining 4 banks (See note 1). \t\t\tCompliance with the Recommendation has been achieved mainly via measures which have a direct impact on capital (retained earnings, new equity, and liability management), with an amount of \u20ac71.6bn representing 95% of the initial shortfall and 76% of the total measures. \t\t\tIn line with the Recommendation, the exercise did not lead to reduced lending to households and corporate or to fire sales of assets. The deleveraging measures agreed as part of the capital plans led to an overall reduction of risk weighted assets (RWAs)\u00a0by only 0.62% compared with the September 2011 aggregate RWAs. Moreover, those measures were concentrated on a small number of banks that have agreed this reduction with international and EU organisations in the framework of formal restructuring and state aid injections. \t\tAs agreed by the European Council on 26 October 2011, for those banks unable to meet the set target using private sources, backstops measures are now being implemented with clear commitments from national governments and, where necessary, EU or international support. \t\t\u00a0 Process \t\t\u00a0 \t\tThe approval and monitoring of the implementation of banks' plans were undertaken by National Supervisors in coordination with the EBA. Plans were discussed in Colleges of supervisors to ensure focus was placed on capital measures and on limited reduction in lending to the real economy. This allowed for dialogue about potential concerns regarding exposure levels of banking groups to their subsidiaries in all Member States. Next steps \t\t\u00a0 \t\tThis overview report is based on preliminary updates as of the end of June on the capital plans provided by the National authorities. The EBA will publish a final report on the exercise in September 2012 based on banks' actual capital positions as at the end of June 2012. The final report will provide information on a bank-by-bank basis. \t\tThe EBA and the National Supervisors will continue to monitor the fulfilment of the Recommendation for all banks included in the sample. Where necessary, National Supervisors may undertake a detailed review of individual bank's asset quality to better understand the risks underlying banks' capital positions in a deteriorating environment. \t\tThe Recommendation will remain into force until rescinded and work is currently underway to map the transition to the future regulatory framework (CRDIV). The key principle for this transition will be to ensure capital conservation in 2013 and beyond. Note to the editors \t\t\u00a0 \t\t(1) Out of the initial shortfall published in December 2011 (\u20ac115bn), the shortfall related to Greek banks (\u20ac30bn) was identified as a component of pre-agreed arrangements under the EU/IMF assistance programme and is treated separately. In addition, three banks (\u00d6esterreichische Volksbank AG, Dexia, WestLB AG) from the original list of banks with shortfalls have been identified in February as undergoing a significant restructuring process, which the EBA has agreed is an appropriate response to the December Recapitalisation Recommendation. Finally, after the triggering of a restructuring process in early May, the Spanish bank Bankia will be monitored separately by the Spanish authorities in conjunction with the European Commission liaising with the ECB, the EBA and the IMF. Therefore the focus of this recapitalisation overview report is the \u20ac76bn shortfall identified for the other 27 banks in the sample. \t\t(2) The EBA Recommendation was adopted by the Board of Supervisors on 8 December 2011 to address the difficult situation in the EU banking system, especially with regard to the sovereign exposures, by restoring stability and confidence in the markets. The Recommendation called on National Authorities to require banks included in the sample to strengthen their capital positions by building up an exceptional and temporary capital buffer against sovereign debt exposures to reflect market prices as at the end of September. In addition, banks were required to establish an exceptional and temporary buffer such that the Core Tier 1 capital ratio reaches a level of 9% by the end of June 2012.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/update-on-the-implementation-of-the-capital-exercise"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1437", "date": "2012-07-11", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA consults on technical standards in relation with credit valuation adjustment risk", "text": " \tThe European Banking Authority (EBA) launches today a consultation on Draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) for credit valuation adjustment risk on the determination of a proxy spread and the specification of a limited number of smaller portfolios.

These RTS are drafted according to the Regulation on OTC derivative transactions, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR). The consultation runs until 31 July 2012. The EMIR Regulation requires CCPs to collect margins, to maintain a pre-funded default fund and to maintain dedicated own resources to cover their losses upon the default of one of their clearing members. Additional capital is also required under Article 16 to mitigate, on the one hand, against market risk, credit risk and counterparty credit risk arising from non-covered activities and, on the other hand, against operational risk arising from all activities of a CCP. The draft RTS developed by the EBA are intended to specify these additional capital requirements. Main features of the RTS The draft RTS proposed for consultation require a CCP to hold capital, including retained earnings and reserves, that is at all times at least equal to the sum of: (i) its operational expenses during an appropriate time span for winding-down or restructuring its activities, (ii) its capital requirements for the overall operational risk, and (iii) its capital requirements for credit, counterparty credit and market risks stemming from non-covered activities it carries out.

Notes to editors The CRR/CRD IV proposals (the so-called Capital Requirements Regulation - \u2018CRR'- and the so-called Capital Requirements Directive \u2013 \u2018CRD') set out prudential requirements which are expected to be applicable as of 1 January 2013.

In this respect, they are an addition to the draft ITS text proposed in the Consultation Paper on supervisory reporting for institutions (CP50) published on 20 December 2011 and need to be read in conjunction with them. Main features of the ITS \tThese ITS aim at providing national authorities with harmonized information on their liquid assets, inflows and outflows and their stable sources of funding using uniform reporting formats developed by the EBA. \tAgainst this background, this consultation paper puts forward proposals regarding the reporting requirements for both liquidity coverage and stable funding. The purpose of this monitoring is two-fold: (i) to inform the economic impact assessment of the liquidity requirements the EBA is asked to perform during the monitoring period, and (ii) to enable competent authorities to monitor institutions' compliance with the liquidity requirements once they have been introduced as binding minimum standards. \tThe scope and level of application of these ITS are in line with the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) text. The latter provides for the liquidity coverage reporting to be done at least monthly and the stable funding reporting at least quarterly. \tThese ITS have been developed on the basis of the templates for liquidity reporting used by the EBA in compiling the Basel III monitoring exercise as well as on the COREP and FINREP guidelines. They also build on voluntary reporting exercises conducted predominantly by larger institutions. Next steps \tThese draft ITS have been developed on the basis of the European Commission's legislative proposals for the CRR/CRD IV. Following the end of the consultation period, and to the extent that the final text of the CRR changes before the adoption of the ITS, the EBA will adapt its draft ITS accordingly to reflect any developments. \tThe CRR also mandates the EBA to develop additional liquidity monitoring metrics to provide competent authorities with a comprehensive view of institutions' liquidity risk profiles. The EBA is currently working on these metrics and will launch a public consultation in due course, depending on the timeline that will be adopted in the CRR. \tAs stated above, the information collected under these ITS will be used to inform the EBA's impact assessment on the introduction of the liquidity requirements.

In this respect, they are an addition to the draft ITS text proposed in the Consultation Paper on supervisory reporting for institutions (CP50) published on 20 December 2011 and need to be read in conjunction with them. \tThe reporting of the data will allow for a comparison of the leverage ratio measure and its components across European financial institutions. In addition, it will serve for the future assessment and calibration of the leverage ratio on which the EBA shall report to the European Commission. Main features of these ITS \tThese ITS aim at providing national authorities with harmonized information on the leverage ratio and its components using uniform reporting formats developed by the EBA. \tThe proposals put forward in this consultation will serve at least two purposes. Firstly, the leverage ratio will be part of the supervisory review by national authorities in order to assess the risk of excessive leverage in its institutions. Secondly, the reporting will give the EBA the ability to quantitatively assess the impact and effectiveness of the leverage ratio, on which the EBA is required to produce a report by 2016. Furthermore, these ITS will allow the EBA to assess any potential calibration of the leverage ratio if needed. \tTo take into account that the leverage ratio should apply to institutions, which differ in size, nature and complexity, it has been deemed necessary to apply the requirements for more detailed reporting of the components of the leverage ratio in a proportionate manner. \tThe scope and level of application of these ITS are in line with the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) text. The reporting frequency is therefore proposed to be on a quarterly basis, in order to be aligned with the proposed CRR requirements for calculation of the leverage ratio. \tThese ITS have been developed based on the template used for the Quantitative Impact Study (QIS) by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and on the COREP and FINREP guidelines.

The consultation runs until 31 July 2012. \tThese technical standards aim at ensuring a uniform approach to disclosure for own funds by institutions and across jurisdictions in order to allow detailed assessments of banks' capital positions and to make cross-jurisdictional comparisons. Main features of the ITS \tTo facilitate international comparisons and to avoid the development of two different disclosure frameworks, the draft ITS follow very closely the approach adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), while making appropriate reference to the EU regulatory framework (Capital Requirements Regulation - CRR). The EBA also ensured that these ITS are consistent with the COREP framework. \tThe requirements contained in the draft ITS are directed at institutions which are requested to complete three sets of templates: \t\ta general own funds disclosure template reflecting the capital position of institutions; \t\ta transitional disclosure template covering the phasing in (from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017) of the regulatory adjustments \u2013 namely with reference to deductions and filters - and reflecting the transitional provisions implemented by the institutions; \t\ta template describing the main features of an institution's capital instruments. \tIn addition to the three templates, institutions are required to provide a balance sheet reconciliation between their financial statements and their regulatory own funds to address the disparities between these two sets of data.

The survey findings indicate that in most countries the Guidelines came into force on 1 January 2011 and that supervisors have actively assessed remuneration policies requiring, where needed, interventions in the remuneration structures and payouts of the variable component. While considerable progress has been reported with respect to the governance of remuneration, some areas of concern remain. Further supervisory guidance is needed in setting up the criteria for identifying risk takers as well as in the application of the proportionality principle and of the risk alignment practices. \tThe findings of the survey have showed a satisfactory implementation of the Guidelines into the respective legal and supervisory frameworks and good progress by the industry has been reported namely as to the practices in the governance of remuneration. \tHowever, the scope of the Guidelines is one of the areas for concern as considerable variations exist in the extent to which the remuneration requirements are applied beyond the scope of the CRD. \tWith regard to the identification of risk takers, the survey has highlighted inconsistencies across institutions in the criteria used to identify staff that have a material impact on the firm's risk profile. Furthermore, such criteria have not always proved to sufficiently grasp the risk impact aspect of the exercise. \tInconsistencies have also emerged in the application of the proportionality principle with practices varying from predetermined fixed criteria to open case-by-case approaches to determine if the set of specific remuneration rules should be applied to identified staff. \tFinally, the survey has showed that risk alignment practices across the industry remain underdeveloped namely with regard to the interaction of parameters used for risk management and the structure of bonus pools. \tIn light of the shortcomings identified by the survey, it is welcomed that the Danish Presidency, in its January compromise text on the CRD IV package, has proposed to widen the scope of the mandate for the EBA to elaborate criteria to identify categories of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the institution's risk profile. Next steps \tThis survey is not the only tool through which the EBA monitors remuneration practices across the institutions of the Member States. The EBA will in the upcoming weeks issue two Guidelines on data collection on remuneration for high earners (individuals earning at least 1 million Euro p.a.) and quantitative information on remuneration by business areas in accordance with point 15(f) of part 2, Annex XII CRD. The EBA will disclose aggregate information on high earners and benchmark the quantitative information received towards the end of this year. Background \tThe Capital Requirements Directive 3 (CRD III) sought to develop risk-based remuneration policies and practices aligned with the long term interests of the institution aimed at avoiding short-term incentives that could lead to excessive risk-taking. This was seen as a key contributory reform in restoring overall financial stability after the 2007-2008 financial crisis. To facilitate the compliance of the remuneration principles included in the amended Annex V of the CRD, on 10 December 2010, CEBS, the EBA's predecessor, published its final Guidelines on remuneration policies and practices and, in line with the entry into force of CRD III, set an implementation date of 1 January 2011.

The report sought to identify differences in the implementation of the Directive and to determine whether such differences create a gap in the EU AML/CTF regime that could be exploited by criminals for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tThe \"Report on the legal and regulatory provisions and supervisory expectations across EU Member States of Simplified Due Diligence requirements where the customers are credit and financial institutions\" provides an overview of EU Member States' legal and regulatory provisions and supervisory expectations in relation to the application of Simplified Due Diligence (SDD) requirements of the 3MLD. The report focuses exclusively on one particular situation of low risk where SDD is applicable, namely where the customer is a credit or financial institution situated in a EU/EEA state or in a country that imposes equivalent AML/CFT requirements.\u00a0 \tBoth reports come to the conclusion that there are significant differences in the implementation across the EU Member States, and that some of these differences could create undesirable effects on the common European Anti Money Laundering Regime. The reports find that some of these differences are not due to the Directive's minimum harmonisation approach, but instead appear to stem from different national interpretations of the Directive's requirements. Both reports also call on the European Union to consider addressing these problems. The Joint Committee \tThe Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1st January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). \tThrough the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely and ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. \tIn addition to being a forum for cooperation, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and in developing the relationship between the ESRB and the ESAs.

This consultation groups fourteen RTS covering, among others, areas such as Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 and from own funds in general and transitional provisions on grandfathering. These RTS will be part of the single rulebook aimed at enhancing regulatory harmonisation in Europe and namely at strengthening the quality of capital. The consultation runs until 04th July 2012. Main features of the RTS \tThese technical standards cover all areas of own funds, from features for instrument of the highest quality (CET1 instruments) to instruments of a lower quality (Tier 2 instruments). \tVarious provisions of the RTS will contribute to increasing the permanence of capital instruments as well as the loss absorbency features of hybrid instruments. \tThe requirements contained in the draft RTS are mainly directed at institutions, although some of them are directed at competent authorities. \tThe RTS cover, in particular, the following areas: \t\u00a0 Common Equity Tier 1 capital, in particular foreseeable charges or dividends, features of capital instruments of mutuals, cooperative societies or similar institutions, applicable forms and nature of indirect funding of capital instruments, limitations on redemption of own funds instruments; Additional Tier 1 capital, in particular the form and nature of incentives to redeem, the conversion or write-down of the principal amount, the use of special purpose entities; Deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 capital and from own funds in general including deductions of capital instruments of financial institutions and insurance/reinsurance undertakings, losses of the current financial year, deferred tax assets, defined benefits pension fund assets, foreseeable tax charges; General requirements like indirect holdings arising from index holdings, supervisory consent for reducing own funds; Transitional provisions for own funds in terms of grandfathering. Next steps \tThe proposed consultation paper is based on the draft Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) as proposed by the European Commission on 20th July 2011. As the text is still being discussed by the EU legislator (European Parliament and Council), some of the mandates for the EBA to develop Binding Technical Standards (BTS) may be modified, added or deleted in the adopted Regulation. Therefore, the proposed RTS will be amended after the consultation to take into account the final CRR text. \tAll the RTS included in this consultation have to be submitted to the EU Commission by 1 January 2013. \tSeparate consultations on some remaining RTS on Own Funds will follow in the second half of 2012. Background \tThe CRR/CRD IV proposals (the so-called Capital Requirements Regulation - \u2018CRR'- and the so-called Capital Requirements Directive \u2013 \u2018CRD') set out prudential requirements which are expected to be applicable as of 1 January 2013. The CRR proposals related to own funds translate the proposals from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision into EU law. Both reforms raise both the quality and quantity of the regulatory capital base. Notes This consultation paper puts forward draft RTS related to the following Articles of the CRR related to Own Funds: Article 24(3); Article 25(2) point b); Article 26(3); Article 27(6); Article 33(2); Article 38(2); Article 46(5); Article 49(2); Article 71(3); Article 73(3); Article 74(2); Article 78(2); Article 461(4); Article 465(3). \tSeparate consultations on Own Funds will cover draft technical standards related to the following Articles: Article 25(2) point a); Article 29(2); Article 31(2); Article 46(4); Article 84(4); Article 92(4); Article 424(2). \tThese draft RTS are produced in accordance with Article 10 of the EBA regulation and as per Article 10(4) of the aforementioned regulation, they shall be adopted by means of regulations or decisions.

This questionnaire will also allow to identify possible stakeholders for a future dialogue with the EBA on Pillar 3 issues once the analysis of the responses has been completed. It is expected that both the analysis of the submitted responses and possible meetings with interested parties will be performed and completed during the planning phase of the 2012 exercise. \tIt was felt that the value of the EBA's output could be enhanced with extensive market outreach, dialogue with preparers and investors, and more generally consideration of what are the needs of the target users of EBA's report assessing Pillar 3 disclosures. Scope and structure of the questionnaire \tThe scope of the 2012 exercise is limited on disclosure areas where: \t\timprovements are still needed, based on the findings/conclusions of the 2011 EBA report (own funds, IRB, remuneration); and \t\tnew requirements have been recently introduced (e.g. securitization, market risk), for which user feedback can reflect expectations regarding newly introduced CRD requirements. \tThe questionnaire is focused on the following three sections: i) identification, ii) a general assessment, and iii) specific disclosures. \tThe questionnaire invites users to lay down their views about how credit institutions articulate their Pillar 3 disclosures in the context of the current CRD framework. Users should refrain from proposing disclosures that are not currently required by the EU framework or from discussing the assessment of disclosures that will be implemented by future frameworks. \tHowever, it was felt important to use this questionnaire as a tool for understanding how relevant and useful were the results and the best practices identified in the previous EBA assessments from a users' perspective. Thus, the current survey includes questions on issues that go beyond the letter of the CRD and are mostly linked with disclosures EBA has identified as best practices. These questions are specifically marked as EBA best practices related questions. Views from users, also from the ones that don't make extensive use of Pillar 3 disclosures , are particularly useful if they can be taken on board for this year's EBA Pillar 3 assessment which is due to start in May 2012. \tAll responses to the questionnaire\u00a0have\u00a0be published on the EBA's website\u00a0 ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/questionnaire-on-the-identification-of-users-investors-needs-on-credit-institutions-pillar-3-disclosures"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1463", "date": "2012-04-02", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EBA Discussion Paper on Draft Regulatory Technical Standards on the capital requirements for CCPs", "text": " \tThe EBA invites market participants and all interested stakeholders to provide their feedback on planned regulatory technical standards on the capital requirements for CCPs under the draft European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) on OTC derivatives, CCPs and Trade Repositories.

It has come to the conclusion that there are many supervisory concerns surrounding the operation of the proposed TLDs by the ICANN, relating mostly to the great potential, according to the EBA view, for misuse by unscrupulous individuals, and that, therefore, any plans for their operation should ideally be discontinued. \tIt is the view of the EBA that potential mitigating measures such as those which, we understand, are envisaged by the ICANN (creation of separate entity for the registration and control of these TLDs, or other technical ways to ensure the security of the system) do not necessarily mitigate the financial supervisors' concerns.

Please send your comments to the following e-mail address: CP51@eba.europa.eu by 26 March 2012. Main features of this ITS This consultation paper puts forward a draft ITS on reporting of large exposures as requested by Article 383 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and represents an addendum to the ITS proposal on supervisory reporting requirements published on the EBA's website on 20 December 2011. \tThis draft ITS aims at implementing uniform reporting requirements which are necessary to ensure fair conditions of competition between comparable groups of credit institutions and investment firms. Uniform requirements will ultimately make institutions more efficient and result in a greater convergence of supervisory practices. \tThe ITS on reporting has been developed on the basis of the guidelines on common reporting of large exposures. The draft ITS will be covering both (i) information needed to check institutions' compliance with the large exposure regime as set out in Articles 376 \u2013 392 of CRR and (ii) information on concentration risk which competent authorities need to analyse as per Article 79 of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). The scope and level of application are in line with the CRR, currently under discussion by the EU legislators. \t\u00a0 Next steps \tThe EBA intends to finalise the draft ITS and submit it to the Commission by 30 June 2012. It should be noted that the proposed submission date assumes that a final CRR will be available beforehand. \tAccording to the European Commission proposals, institutions are required to comply with new CRR requirements as of 1 January 2013. Therefore, the first regular reporting period thereafter is expected to be Q1 2013 with the first reporting reference date being 31 March 2013. By 13 May 2013, institutions will then have to submit to national authorities a first set of data related to the reference date. Background: CRD IV/CRR \tThis draft ITS is part of the CRR which sets out prudential requirements for institutions which are expected to be applicable as of 1 January 2013. \tThe CRR contains in a number of Articles specific mandates for the EBA to develop draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) related to supervisory reporting requirements. \tThese ITS will be part of the single rulebook enhancing regulatory harmonisation in Europe with the particular aim of specifying uniform formats, frequencies and dates of prudential reporting as well as IT solutions to be applied by credit institutions and investment firms in Europe.

Their review highlights that, in aggregate, the shortfalls are expected to be met primarily through direct capital measures. The measures are not viewed as having a negative impact on lending into the real economy. The Board of Supervisors also agreed that, in the context of the ongoing recapitalisation exercise, the EBA would undertake its next EU-wide stress test in 2013. \u00a0 \tThe Board of Supervisors undertook a preliminary overview of the proposed measures highlighting the following: \t\tThe total actions give a capital surplus of approximately 26%, creating some leeway in case some actions do not materialise. \t\tThe actions predominantly focus on direct capital measures which account for 96% of the capital shortfall and for 77% of the total amount of actions proposed. The majority of these are capital raising, retained earnings and conversion of hybrids to common equity. Measures impacting risk-weighted assets (RWAs) account for the remaining 23% of total amount of actions. \t\tAfter taking account of the measures arising from EU State Aid decisions on banks restructuring or other country programmes, the impact of actions reducing lending into the real economy would be less than 1% of the total amount. \tAn aggregate description of the capital plans is provided in the annex. Next steps \tThe Board of Supervisors has not yet assessed the viability of the plans. In-depth analysis of these will be undertaken by National Authorities in close cooperation with the EBA and other relevant authorities in Colleges of supervisors. The Supervisory Colleges of the banks concerned will, throughout February and beyond, ensure adequate consultation between home and host authorities on the plans and the impact in their jurisdictions. \tThe analysis will assess the credibility of measures such as forecasts of retained earnings, the effectiveness of the process for the approval of new advanced models and the reliability of assumptions underlying the planned disposal of assets and their geographical impact. \tDuring this process, capital plans may be challenged and in some cases revised. If earning forecasts, or other assumptions, look optimistic, back-up plans will be requested. Capital relief for new models will be subject to scrutiny by consolidating supervisors and Colleges. \tBanks should expect to receive clear guidance on their plans from National Authorities in early March after which the EBA's Board of Supervisors will continue to monitor the viability of the plans ahead of the June deadline. All National Authorities signalled their commitment to comply with the Recommendation using their supervisory powers. \tThe EBA will liaise with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) to ensure that due consideration is given to macro-prudential issues and to the aggregate impact on the real economy. \tThe EBA, with the support of the ESRB, will continue to monitor the need for the sovereign buffer. Background \tThe EBA's Recommendation adopted by the Board of Supervisors on 8 December 2011 is part of a broader European package, agreed by the European Council on 26 October and confirmed during the ECOFIN Council on 30 November, to address the current situation in the EU by restoring stability and confidence in the markets. \tThe Recommendation calls on National Authorities to require banks included in the sample to strengthen their capital positions by building up an exceptional and temporary capital buffer against sovereign debt exposures to reflect market prices as at the end of September. In addition, banks are required to establish an exceptional and temporary buffer such that the Core Tier 1 capital ratio reaches a level of 9% by the end of June 2012. \tAs required by the EBA's Recommendation, relevant banks submitted their capital plans by 20 January 2012 to their respective national supervisors. The plans were discussed by the EBA's Board of Supervisors on 8 and 9 February 2012.\u00a0\u00a0 Note to the Editors Three banks (\u00d6esterreichische Volksbank AG, Dexia, WestLB AG) from the original list of banks with shortfalls have been identified as undergoing a significant restructuring process, which the EBA has agreed is an appropriate response to the December Recapitalisation Recommendation. Therefore, they will not be assessed against the capital levels of 9% after accounting for an appropriate sovereign buffer. In addition, the shortfall related to Greek banks was identified as a component of pre-agreed arrangements under the EU/IMF assistance programme and is treated separately. Therefore the focus of the recapitalisation plans under review by the Board of Supervisors is the EUR78bn shortfall identified for the other banks in the sample.

Proportionality is an integral part of the ITS with certain reporting requirements being applicable only to institutions using complex approaches to measure own funds requirements or to institutions that have significant risk exposures. \tMoreover, given that there is not as yet harmonisation on the underlying accounting frameworks applied in the various Member States, the ITS has taken this into account when defining the formats and frequency of supervisory reporting. The ITS does not intend to harmonise the underlying valuation measures. Next steps According to the European Commission proposals, institutions are required to comply with new CRR requirements as of 1 January 2013. Therefore, the first regular reporting period thereafter is expected to be Q1 2013 with the first reporting reference date being 31 March 2013. Institutions will then have to submit a first set of data related to the reference date to national authorities by 13 May 2013. \tThe EBA intends to finalise the draft ITS and submit it to the Commission by 30 June 2012. \tIt should be noted that the proposed submission date assumes that a final CRR will be available beforehand. Background: CRD IV/CRR This draft ITS is part of the CRR which sets out prudential requirements for institutions which are expected to be applicable as of 1 January 2013. \tThe CRR contains in a number of Articles specific mandates for the EBA to develop draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) related to supervisory reporting requirements. \tThese ITS will be part of the single rulebook enhancing regulatory harmonisation in Europe with the particular aim of specifying uniform formats, frequencies and dates of prudential reporting as well as IT solutions to be applied by credit institutions and investment firms in Europe.

These measures form part of a broader European package, agreed by the European Council on 26 October and confirmed during the ECOFIN Council on 30 November, to address the current situation in the EU by restoring stability and confidence in the markets. \tThe formal Recommendation adopted by the EBA's Board of Supervisors states that national supervisory authorities should require the banks included in the sample to strengthen their capital positions by building up an exceptional and temporary capital buffer against sovereign debt exposures to reflect market prices as at the end of September. In addition, banks will be required to establish an exceptional and temporary buffer such that the Core Tier 1 capital ratio reaches a level of 9% by the end of June 2012. The amount of any capital shortfall identified is based on September 2011 figures and the amount of the sovereign capital buffer will not be revised. Sales of sovereign bonds will not alleviate the buffer requirement to be achieved by June 2012. \tThese buffers are explicitly not designed to cover losses in sovereigns but to provide a reassurance to markets about the banks' ability to withstand a range of shocks and still maintain adequate capital. The sovereign capital buffer is a one-off measure and, once the deployment of the new EFSF's capacity becomes effective in addressing the sovereign debt crisis by lifting sovereign bond valuations from today's distressed prices, the EBA will reassess the ongoing need for and size of capital buffers against banks' sovereign exposures. \tNational supervisory authorities may, following consultation with the EBA, agree to the partial achievement of the target by the sales of selected assets that do not lead to a reduced flow of lending to the EU's real economy but simply to a transfer of contracts or business units to a third party. These latter actions are not considered as deleveraging for the financial system as a whole, as assets are transferred to third parties rather than reduced. Reductions in risk weighted assets due to the validation and roll-out of internal models to additional portfolios should not be allowed as a means of addressing a capital shortfall unless these changes are already planned and under consideration by the competent authority. Banks should first use private sources of funding to strengthen their capital position to meet the required target, including retained earnings, reduced bonus payments, new issuances of common equity and suitably strong contingent capital, and other liability management measures. \tFollowing completion of the capital exercise conducted in close cooperation with the competent national authority, the European Banking Authority has determined that the aggregated shortfall amounts to 114.7bn Euros. A breakdown by country and on a bank-by-bank basis is also published today (1). Next steps \tPursuant to the Recommendation, the national authorities will require banks to submit, by 20th January, their plans detailing the actions they intend to take to reach the set targets. These plans will have to be agreed with National authorities and reviewed, shared and consulted on with the EBA and with other relevant competent authorities within colleges of supervisors as appropriate. National authorities will seek to ensure that throughout the colleges' discussions of capital plans the need to maintain exposure levels of banking groups in all Member States is taken into account, recalling that if and where necessary the EBA will use its mediation role to that effect. \tThe EBA previously already identified a lack of access to term funding as a serious hindrance to banks continued lending activities and agreed the measures announced today as part of broader efforts to restore confidence\u00a0in the EU banking system with the aim of maintaining lending into the real economy. National authorities and the EBA will seek to ensure that the actions taken to comply with the set requirements do not lead to significant constraints on the credit flow to the EU real economy. \tThe capital needs will be met with capital of the highest quality. For the purpose of this exercise, new issuances of very strong private convertible capital can be accepted if in line with the criteria defined by the EBA in the ad-hoc term-sheet. The term sheet designed by the EBA focuses only on the terms and conditions related to the prudential aspects of the instrument. It does not touch the other aspects of the contracts. Existing convertible capital instruments will not be eligible unless they are converted into Core Tier 1 capital by end of October 2012.

The assistance programme already defines a set of targets for the banks in question, including quantitative objectives for the Core Tier 1 ratio, which are being monitored on a regular basis. For Greece the minimum backstop measures exceed the EBA exercise and no new benchmarks have been set for Greek banks. Data for Greek banks are therefore not disclosed. \t(2) A substantial part of this amount is attributable to \u00d6sterreichische Volksbank AG and should be considered as pro-forma.

After the cut-off date of 30 September, this Group has indeed been deeply restructured and a state guarantee will be provided on the funding issued by Dexia SA and its subsidiary Dexia Credit Local subject to the approval of the European Commission. The restructured group, which will not further develop significant cross-border activity and will gradually shrink in size, will not remain in the EBA sample. The sale of Dexia Bank Belgium has led to a fresh cash injection of 4bn Euros whilst the disposal processes of other important entities (Dexia Bank International \u00e0 Luxemburg, RBC Dexia Investor Services, Dexia Asset Management, Dexia Municipal Agency and DenizBank) will aim to further strengthen its capital position. \t(4) As an EFTA state of the EEA, any requirement and supervisory action pertaining to capital needs in Norwegian banks is within the competence of Norwegian authorities ", "url": "https://eba.europa.eu/the-eba-publishes-recommendation-and-final-results-of-bank-recapitalisation-plan-as-part-of-co-ordinated-measures-to-restore-confidence-in-the-banking"}, {"id": "EBA_PR_1481", "date": "2011-12-07", "text_type": "PR", "title": "The EBA announces the publication date of the recapitalisation exercise", "text": " \tThe EBA will publish the formal Recommendation and the final aggregate results of the recapitalisation exercise at 18:00 CET on 8 December 2011. \tOn that same day, banks will publish their individual results on their respective websites at 18:00 CET and National Supervisory Authorities will re-publish them between 18:01 and 18:30.

These measures form part of a broader package aimed at addressing the current situation in the EU by restoring stability and confidence in the markets. Their implementation is conditional on the other components of the package being fully clarified and endorsed. \tThe EBA's contribution to the overall package focuses on the capital and term funding needs in the EU banking sector against the backdrop of the increasing concerns regarding sovereign debt. Term funding guarantee scheme Notwithstanding the European Central Bank's (ECB) support for banks short term funding needs, additional steps are required to restart the term unsecured funding market. This would help banks to continue their lending activities in 2012 and to avoid a spiral of forced deleveraging and the ensuing credit crunches, which would affect the real economy. \t\tTo this end, public guarantee schemes should be set in place where appropriate to support banks' access to term funding at reasonable conditions. A coordinated approach at EU level is needed, especially in terms of entry criteria, pricing and conditions. The EBA has been asked to work with the EU Commission, the ECB and European Investment Bank (EIB) to urgently explore options for achieving this objective. Measures to strengthen banks' capital positions \t\tIn light of the substantial increase in systemic risk triggered by the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, the EBA has designed a capital package which, while recognising the significant steps already taken to strengthen capital positions in the EU, aims at providing a further capital buffer for the EU banking system. \t\tBanks are required to strengthen their capital positions by building up a temporary capital buffer against sovereign debt exposures to reflect current market prices. In addition, banks are required to establish a buffer such that the Core Tier 1 capital ratio reaches 9%. Banks will be expected to build these buffers by the end of June 2012. \t\tThe building of these buffers will allow banks to withstand a range of shocks while still being able to maintain an adequate capital level. \t\tA preliminary and indicative aggregated capital target at the EU level, based on June's figures and end-September sovereign bond yields, amounts to 106 bn Euros (see breakdown by country below). The EBA expects to disclose the final capital shortfall in the course of November, based on banks' figures as at 30 September 2011, when individual banks will be asked to disclose their capital and sovereign debt position. \t\tBanks will be required, by the end of 2011, to submit to their respective national authorities their plans detailing the actions they intend to take to reach the set targets. These plans will have to be agreed with National Supervisory Authorities and discussed with the EBA.

The review welcomes the efforts made by banks to improve their disclosures and to convey their risk profile in a comprehensive way to market participants. However, the EBA calls for further improvements and the need for greater harmonisation of the disclosures provided. \tThe main conclusions of the analysis confirmed that banks have made efforts to improve their disclosures and to convey their risk profile in a comprehensive way to market participants. In all areas under review, best practice disclosures have been identified, and the EBA encourages credit institutions to follow them. \tIn addition, the analysis states that some of the findings included in the 2010 report calling for further improvements remain valid although they apply to a reduced number of banks or concern specific requirements of the CRD (eg. quantitative back-testing information for credit risk, information on counterparty credit risk covering the issue of wrong-way risk, etc.). \tFinally, the EBA calls for further efforts to be made for a greater harmonisation of the disclosures provided by the firms, in terms of both timeline and standardisation in the presentation of public data. This would benefit both supervisors and market participants. \tThis report is a continuation of the work carried by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), the predecessor of the EBA, since 2008. It is important to note that the assessment of the 2010 Pillar 3 disclosures differs from the previous two reviews. First, the scope of the EBA's review was limited in order to focus on areas where the previous review showed that improvements were necessary. Second, in addition to the findings of the EBA's analysis, the current report also includes some observations on how banks dealt with the interactions between International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Pillar 3 requirements in the specific disclosure areas considered. \tThe EBA will continue its efforts in assessing banks' Pillar 3 disclosures in the future.

Effective internal governance is fundamental if individual institutions and the banking system as a whole are to operate well. \tArticle 22 of Directive 2006/48/EC requires that every credit institution shall have robust governance arrangements, which include a clear organisational structure with well defined, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility, effective processes to identify, manage, monitor and report the risks it is or might be exposed to, adequate internal control mechanisms, including sound administrative and accounting procedures, and remuneration policies and practices that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management. Furthermore, Article 73 (3) of the same Directive requires that Article 22 is also applied to parent undertakings and subsidiaries on a consolidated or sub-consolidated basis. \tA survey on the implementation of internal governance arrangements, conducted under CEBS in 2008, revealed a number of weaknesses in terms of oversight of the supervisory function, risk management and internal control frameworks. The complexity of individual institutions coupled with the riskiness of the products and services offered were often not sufficiently offset by appropriate internal governance arrangements. \tTaking into account the results of the survey and the recent work done by other European and international bodies on corporate governance, the EBA has consolidated and updated its former guidelines on internal governance into the present Guidelines on Internal Governance. Beside other enhancements, new chapters have been added on the transparency of the corporate structure, the role, tasks and responsibilities of the supervisory function and on IT-systems and business continuity management. \tThe EBA Internal Governance Guidelines repeal the 2010 High Level Principles for Risk Management, the 2009 High Level Principles for Remuneration Policies and Section 2.1 of the 2006 Guidelines on the Application of the Supervisory Review Process under Pillar 2. \tThe EBA reviewed these Guidelines following a public consultation and the input provided by the EBA's Banking Stakeholder Group. Overall, respondents were supportive of the proposed Guidelines and appreciated the EBA's initiative to develop a comprehensive set of internal governance guidelines in line with international standards. \tThe EBA expects competent authorities to implement the Guidelines on Internal Governance and to incorporate them within their supervisory procedures by 31 March 2012. As of that date,\u00a0competent authorities\u00a0should ensure that institutions effectively comply with the new Guidelines.

It takes the existing EU definition of Tier 1 net of deductions of participations in financial institutions and it strips out hybrid instruments including existing preference shares. It recognises existing government support measures, which will be identified separately in the results. \tTo ensure a fully harmonised computation by all the banks involved in the exercise, the EBA has mapped the different capital elements of CT1 to the current COREP reporting framework. \tOnly commercial instruments of the highest quality are included in this CT1 definition \u2013 ordinary shares or similar instruments in line with the principles detailed in CEBS/EBA guidelines on core capital. \tThis means, in particular, that the commercial instruments included in CT1 have to be simple, issued directly by the institution itself and able, both immediately and without any doubt, to meet the criteria of permanence, flexibility of payments and loss absorption in going concern situations. The inclusion of government support measures in this definition reflects the expectation of supervisors that those instruments will be fully available to absorb losses and shelter banks in case of difficulties. \tTo ensure full transparency, the stress test will include full disclosure of all capital elements included in CT1 and their evolution since December 2010, under both the baseline and the adverse scenarios.\u00a0 \tThe 5% CT1 benchmark is not a legal minimum requirement. However, the EBA expects any bank failing to meet the benchmark, or showing specific weaknesses in the stress test, to agree with the relevant supervisory authority the appropriate remedial measures and execute them in due time. The EBA expects these measures to be disclosed separately. \tThis year, the sample contains 90 banks, including a number of banks which were not included last year.

Barnier was warmly welcomed by the EBA Chairperson, Andrea Enria, the EBA staff and other guests, including MEP Sharon Bowles, representatives from UK political, financial and monetary bodies and dignitaries of the City of London. \tIn his opening address, Andrea Enria underlined the importance of close co-operation and coordination within the new supervisory architecture. This collaboration with the EU Commission, the other institutional partners in the EU and the national supervisory authorities \"should be understood not merely as an exhortatory notion but in the sense of supervisory convergence and cooperation, as opposed to the regulatory competition we experienced in the run up to the crisis\" said the EBA Chairperson. \tThe pivotal role of the EBA within the new supervisory architecture was one of Commissioner Barnier's key messages: \"the establishment of the European Banking Authority is a milestone for Europe, its financial markets and centres, and the EBA has the potential to make a real difference by contributing to a safer, sounder and more responsible financial system\". \t\"The activity of the EBA is much more than mere coordination and cooperation\", added Barnier, as \"more convergence among member states both on rules and on supervisory practices is required to achieve a single EU rulebook. And this is not an option but a must\". \tBarnier also recalled some of the key challenges the EBA is currently confronted with, including the on-going round of stress tests and remuneration policies. With reference to the 2011 EU-wide stress test, Barnier insisted on the need for this stress test to be \"credible, robust and ambitious in terms of disclosure and transparency\". \tOn behalf of the EU Parliament, MEP Sharon Bowles highlighted the importance of the three European Supervisory Authorities which \"are not merely a crisis response, but an evolutionary process dictated by the logical need of a single market for financial services\". \tThomas Huertas, the EBA Alternate Chairperson, in his closing remarks also expressed the commitment of the EBA Members to closely cooperate with the EU institutions to meet all the challenges the EBA will be facing in the future.

The stress test assesses what might happen to banks if external circumstances deteriorate markedly and helps to identify vulnerabilities and relevant remedial action, including strengthening capital levels where this is needed. \tThe documents contain information on the macro-economic scenarios and the methodologies that are used to assess the impact changes in the economic environment have on banks. \tThe adverse scenario, designed by the ECB, is more severe than the 2010 CEBS' exercise in terms of deviation from the baseline forecast and probability that it materialises. It includes a marked deterioration in the main macro-economic variables, such as GDP (which falls four percentage points from the baseline compared to three in the 2010 exercise), unemployment, and house prices. The adverse scenario also includes a specific sovereign stress in the EU leading to further falls in the price of some EU bonds from the already stressed levels seen at end 2010. The sovereign haircuts will apply to positions in the trading book where losses would materialise and will be accompanied by full disclosure of all relevant sovereign holdings. \tThe methodologies and assumptions are designed to ensure the stress is applied consistently across all the banks in the exercise. In particular, the static balance sheet assumption freezes banks' balance sheets of end 2010. This ensures consistency and prevents banks from claiming they would change their business model or sell off risky assets to mitigate the risk. \tThe capital threshold will be focused on a definition of core tier 1 capital which is more restrictive than the tier 1 threshold used last year. The EBA is currently defining common criteria for core tier 1 capital that will be applied consistently across the EU. \tThe exercise is being run between March and June 2011. During this period, a quality assurance and peer review process will be conducted by the EBA, as an independent Authority, in conjunction with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).\u00a0 The results of the exercise will be published on a bank-by-bank basis in mid June. \tThe EBA is coordinating the stress test with the national supervisory authorities, the ESRB, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission.
