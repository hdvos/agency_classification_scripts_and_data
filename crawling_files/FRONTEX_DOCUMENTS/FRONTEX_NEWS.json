The agreement has been signed in the presence of EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson and Slovenia\u2019s Minister of Interior Ale\u0161 Hojs. \u201cThis is a historic step for the standing corps and the European Union,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. \u201cThe Frontex standing corps officers have undergone extensive firearms training, they have been vetted by national authorities and have completed a psychological assessment. I am grateful to Commissioner Johansson and the EU presidency for their presence. This will give us more flexibility to continue our support to Lithuania after the end of the rapid intervention,\u201d he added. For the first time, the Frontex standing corps officers recruited as EU statutory staff (category 1) will be able to carry firearms for patrolling activities. This agreement will be followed by similar agreements with other national authorities in the coming months. The use of force by Frontex staff is governed by the regulation on the European Border and Coast Guard, and includes a specific control mechanism. The officers work under the command of national authorities. Any incident involving the use of force shall be immediately reported to Frontex. The European Border and Coast Guard standing corps helps make the Schengen Area, the largest free travel area in the world, stronger and more resilient. The standing corps began operating in 2021 and will grow to up to 10,000 officers by 2027. It is composed of four categories: Category 1 officers are recruited and trained by Frontex, Category 2 officers are seconded by Member States for two to four years; Category 3 officers are seconded for four months; Category 4 are part of the rapid reaction pool only seconded in case of activation of a Rapid Border Intervention.

In October, there were close to 22 800 illegal border crossings on Europe\u2019s main migratory routes, 30% more than in 2020 when pandemic-related border restrictions were in place. It is also 18% more compared with October 2019 and the pre-COVID situation. The most significant increase was reported on the Eastern, Western Balkan and Central Mediterranean routes and in Cyprus. The number of detections dropped in the Western Mediterranean. Eastern BordersOn the EU\u2019s Eastern frontier, the total number of detections of illegal border crossings this year amounted to close to 8 000, fifteen times more than in 2020. Main nationalities include migrants from Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. The EU border with Belarus remained the most affected by the migration flow in 2021.\u00a0 After reaching historical high of arrivals in July (climbing over 3 200), migrant arrivals on the Eastern land route decreased in the following months dropping to over 600 in October 2021. While high level frictions between the EU and the Belarussian regime continue, the EU Member States neighbouring Belarus have all significantly strengthened their border-control measures under exceptional states of emergency. The enhanced controls prevented large-scale flows from reaching the EU from Belarus in October.Western Balkan routeSo far this year, 48 500 illegal border crossings have been reported on the Western Balkans route. Only in October, more than 9 000 illegal crossings were detected, an increase of 140% compared with last year (3816) and an increase of 810% compared with October 2019 (1003). That means that in October, 40% of illegal crossings into the EU occurred via the Western Balkans. Most migrants on this route came from Syria, Afghanistan and Morocco.Central Mediterranean routeBetween January and October, European authorities reported 55 000 illegal border crossings on the Central Mediterranean route. In October alone, 6 240 illegal crossings were reported, 85% more than in the previous year under COVID-related restrictions and 186% more than in 2019. A significant development to in October is the growing number of migrants registered in Italy arriving directly from Turkey by sea. The main nationalities on this route included Tunisians, Bangladeshi and Egyptians. Egyptians have become the third main nationality registered in the Central Mediterranean, reported mainly from Libya.Western Mediterranean routeIn the first 10 months of this year, there were 16 390 illegal border crossings reported on the Western Mediterranean route, about 14% more than last year and 23% less as compared to 2019. In October, 1614 illegal crossings were detected, down 42% from last year. Algerians accounted for 63% of illegal crossings on this route, followed by Moroccans (29%).Western AfricanOn the Western African route, the total number of detections this year stood at 16 710, up 46% from 2020 and an increase of 1020% compared with 2019 In October, 3515 illegal crossings were detected, 34% fewer than in the same month last year.

It was an action under the umbrella of EMPACT Priority Organised Property Crime*, co-led by Greece, Germany, Poland, and Europol. Hundreds of police officers and border guards from 23 European and Western Balkan countries were involved in the operation. European standing corps officers deployed by Frontex as part of the agency\u2019s ongoing land operations supported the action with their expertise. Within two weeks, officers involved in the operation performed 10 000 checks of different databases leading to the seizure of 518 stolen vehicles. Participating countries also confiscated 400 stolen vehicle parts found in trucks and in chop shops, leading to new investigations against car crime gangs. In addition, over 140 of forged or falsified ID documents and vehicles documents were detected.Thanks to the cooperation between various authorities, several luxury cars were seized in different EU countries, which shows international character of the threat. Officers also raided chop shops \u2013 places where stolen vehicles were dismantled into parts to be further smuggled and sold online. During the checks of thousands of vehicles and boats, authorities detected 1000 irregular migrants on the way to the EU via land and sea routes. 31 facilitators of migrant smuggling have been arrested. Thanks to the multipurpose approach, also other types of criminal activities were targeted, including trafficking in drugs, firearms and endangered species. Sharing information Frontex set up a coordination centre at its headquarters in Warsaw, where officers from participating countries could exchange information. INTERPOL provided key support to the operation by sharing its expertise, databases and worldwide network. During the joint action, law enforcement authorities worked hand in hand with the private industry, especially car manufacturers, rental and leasing companies, but also producers of boats, to target motor vehicle crime in a more efficient manner. Thanks to the action, criminals were prevented from smuggling many vehicles and boats overseas.

During the workshop, the 20 officers were presented with recent cases of firearms trafficking observed at the EU\u2019s external borders and honed their skills in securing detected weapons as evidence to enable further investigation and prosecution.Most detections of firearms trafficking last year took place at the external land borders, where the smuggling is often small in scale and carried out by both organised crime groups and individuals who hide the weapons in cars or in travellers\u2019 luggage.\u00a0 While this is nothing out of the ordinary, fighting against developments such as trafficking of guns broken down into components, which makes them harder to detect, and the increase in postal deliveries of parts purchased online requires border authorities to constantly develop their knowledge and skills.

The Entry Exit System (EES) will change the way we cross borders and help protect the security of European citizens centralising the information on border crossings. The system will register travellers from non-EU countries \u2013 both short-stay visa holders and visa exempt travellers, each time they cross an EU external border. It will register the traveller\u2019s name, travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and facial image) and the date and place of entry or exit, in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection. Frontex has just completed the Entry Exit System pilot project at land borders, which was hosted by Spain and Bulgaria. The exercise simulated the future EES environment by collecting and cross-checking the required data in full compliance with fundamental rights and personal data protection measures. During the trial, four travellers could be processed at the same time under the supervision of one border guard, proving the efficiency of the system while maintaining direct control of law enforcement officers. As part of the trial, practical demonstrations of the systems took place at Bulgaria\u2019s border with Turkey and Spain\u2019s border with the UK (Gibraltar) and included self-service kiosks, seamless corridors and mobile devices used for registration and verification of travellers. Participants observed the processing of passengers and received feedback from colleagues operating the system.

The individual concerned, arrested in Algeria, was subject to an INTERPOL Red Notice for terrorism activities. An additional 24 terrorism-related hits based on checks in INTERPOL and national law enforcement databases were identified throughout the operation.\u00a0 Led by INTERPOL with the support of the World Customs Organization (WCO) and Frontex, Neptune III involved law enforcement in five countries \u2013 Algeria, France, Italy, Spain and Tunisia \u2013 and was carried out during the summer 2021 tourist season. Frontex supported the operation in partnership with Italy and France as part of its multipurpose operations at sea borders. The agency concentrated on Mediterranean seaports and the movements of suspected terrorists using established ferry routes between the EU and North African countries during the busy summer tourist season. Four Frontex standing corps officers were deployed at sea ports in Italy and France to assist with border checks, screening and profiling of suspected terrorists, preventing unauthorised border crossings and detecting cross-border crime. The officers also supported local authorities with the identification of document fraud. On the spot, they held information sessions on how to spot suspected terrorists on the move and on the latest trends in the document fraud. INTERPOL deployed officers to assist local authorities in screening travellers, cross-checking their data against INTERPOL and national databases. The WCO deployed two officers in Italy and France to assist local Custom services, collected information on all Customs seizures and ensured that data were effectively shared between Customs services through its secure communication platform, CENcomm. Alarming results Tens of thousands of vehicles and passengers cross international borders via maritime routes every year. Traffickers and terrorists regularly take these routes, compromising regional security across Europe and Africa. Operation Neptune III produced the following results: Arrests: 29 individuals were arrested on charges of terrorism, drug trafficking, vehicle theft, crimes against children, sexual violence, fraud and human trafficking, among other crimes. Seizures:17.5 kg of cocaine, with an estimated street value of EUR 1.2 million;More than 20,000 ecstasy pills;189 kg of tobacco products;Five vehicles (three luxury cars and two motorcycles);One handgun and 29 hunting rifles;Over EUR 260,000 in cash. Sharing information to save lives INTERPOL\u2019s databases contain details of around 135,000 individuals suspected of terrorist activity, making the Organization the largest repository of such information. Data are collected from and shared with law enforcement in INTERPOL\u2019s 194 member countries. Operation Neptune III saw officers from participating member countries conduct systematic screenings of individuals and their passports at selected seaports and maritime operational zones. Terrorism and organized crime are often transnational by nature, making cross-border information sharing between law enforcement agencies critical to ensuring front-line border officers can screen individuals using the most complete information available. While the screening of passengers constitutes a routine procedure, the potential consequences of border officers\u2019 decisions can sometimes be a matter of life and death. Hunting rifles bound for Tunisia Customs administrations participating in the operation strengthened controls on passengers and their belongings, targeting especially the smuggling of currency and weapons. They shared information with each other on any seizures made during inspections of passenger baggage, vessels and vehicles. The Tunisia Customs Service seized 29\u00a0hunting rifles that had been concealed inside a vehicle that had departed from Genoa, Italy, on a ferry bound for Zarzis, on Tunisia\u2019s southeastern coast. Italian Customs and the Guardia di Finanza made numerous seizures of tobacco products, stolen electronic goods and over 2,000\u00a0items of counterfeit designer clothing, while French Customs seized 93\u00a0kg of tobacco from a single individual. Operation Neptune was supported by funding from the INTERPOL Foundation for a Safer World.

The main operational activities are listed in a joint report of the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies Network (JHAAN) published today at the occasion of EU Anti-Trafficking Day under the leadership of Eurojust. The report is a key building block of the EU Strategy on combatting Trafficking\u00a0in\u00a0Human\u00a0Beings and serves as a key reference document for national authorities engaged in tackling human trafficking. The report includes an overview of different actions taken by the nine EU agencies to reach out to victims of human trafficking at all stages of prevention, investigations, operations and legal proceedings. The initiative is a concrete result following the Joint Statement of commitment to work together against trafficking in human beings , signed in 2018. The JHAAN report of today aims to make Member States more aware of the agencies\u2019 potential in helping the early identification and protection of victims. Furthermore, it encourages them to cooperate closely with the agencies involved in this area and to build on their expertise.\u00a0 The report responds to one of the key actions of the EU Strategy on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings 2021-2025. Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, trains border guards across Europe and in non-EU countries on how to detect and protect potential victims of trafficking and refer them to national authorities. The agency runs a number of operations at international airports, sea and land borders aimed at detecting victims of trafficking, especially children. It should be emphasised that early identification is crucial to promptly assist, support and protect victims of trafficking in human beings and enable police and prosecution authorities to better investigate and punish traffickers. This is why together with specialists in THB prevention across Europe, Frontex created a manual for border guards and airport staff to help spot children who may be victims of trafficking. Frontex also developed a handbook on risk profiles, as well as handbooks for border guards at land and sea borders that are used in all Frontex-coordinated operations at external borders. The agency regularly organises awareness sessions together with international organisations and NGOs in support to the identification of potential victims of THB. This year, Frontex organised exercises at selected European airports to assess the border guards\u2019 knowledge on indicators and risk profiles as well as the functioning of the referral mechanism in practice. Frontex is an active player in European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats (EMPACT) THB, and takes part in Europe-wide operations against trafficking in human beings called Joint Action Days. This year, Frontex helped identify 187 potential victims of human trafficking, 92 of whom were confirmed to be minors, arrest 175 suspected smugglers and initiate 181 new investigations as part of Joint Action Days. An important part of our efforts targeting trafficking in human beings also takes place within the Africa-Frontex Intelligence Community (AFIC). Frontex set up Risk Analysis Cells in Gambia, Niger and Senegal that collect and analyse strategic data on cross-border crime and facilitate information exchange between various African countries.

Starting at the end of 2022, these visa-exempt travellers will be required to apply for an ETIAS travel authorisation before they start their trip. The EU will not be the first to introduce such a system: for many years now, visa-exempt travellers have had to apply for a travel authorisation to enter the US, Canada or Australia. The European Travel Information and Authorisation System \u2013 ETIAS \u2013 is being developed to maintain a high level of internal security of the European Union, while ensuring smooth border crossings for travellers. Currently, border authorities in Europe assess whether visa-exempted travellers pose a security, public health, or migratory risk when they have already arrived at the border. ETIAS will allow for that assessment to be done before the travellers start their trip. \u201cETIAS is an important part of the digitalisation process of our border management, helping to ensure the resumption of international mobility in the post-COVID world with higher security and safety standards,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.\u00a0 \u00a0 The authorisation procedure in practice Just like in case of Canada, US and Australia, travellers will apply for the European travel authorisation online, either using the ETIAS website or mobile application. They will also have to pay a fee of EUR 7. In most cases, the online application will only take a few minutes to complete. The system will automatically compare the personal data submitted by the applicants with the data already stored in various EU information systems. In case of a \u2018hit\u2019, the application will be manually processed by the ETIAS Central Unit, managed by Frontex, and forwarded to the ETIAS National Units in Member States for final assessment. It is expected that some 97% will be accepted in the automated procedure within 96 hours. The remaining 3% will be decided on by the ETIAS National Units. \u00a0\u00a0 An ETIAS authorisation will be valid for three years for the entire territory of the Schengen area, or until the validity of the travel document the applicant used expires - whichever comes first. Challenges Setting up ETIAS is far from a simple task. The challenges are massive as the system will have to be very secure not only because it will have to process personal data of the millions of applicants, but it will also need to be connected to a variety of databases such as SIS, VIS, EES, Eurodac and ECRIS-TCN. Currently many of these systems do not \u2018talk\u2019 to each other, so making them interoperable is essential. Considering the scale and complexity of this project, it is not surprising that 34 institutional actors are closely cooperating to make it happen. These include the European Commission, Frontex which is setting up its Central Unit, eu-LISA which is developing the IT systems, Europol which will provide its own data for the security screening of the application, and the authorities of each of the 30 European countries currently in the process of setting up their ETIAS national Units. Latest developments While most of the preparations happen behind the scenes, this month has already seen their first, tangible results. Last week 41 new staff members joined Frontex to work at the ETIAS Central Unit. They include 28 ETIAS applications handlers, two team leaders, and 11 traveller & carrier support operators, who are currently testing the system developed by eu-LISA. Once ETIAS becomes operational, they will process and screen applications from visa-exempt travellers who apply for an ETIAS travel authorisation and perform helpdesk assistance functions to support ETIAS applicants and carriers. It is expected that the number of ETIAS Central Unit staff will grow to over 200 in the coming years.\u00a0Check here if you want to know more about the role of Frontex in ETIAS. Getting carries onboard has also progressed this month: from now on, air and sea carriers as well as international carriers transporting groups over land by coach are able to register both for the Entry/Exit System (EES) and for ETIAS on the\u00a0eu-LISA website. The registration enables carriers to perform a query in the EU IT systems before transporting passengers to the Schengen Area, as is their obligation under EU law.

This is why on 5-6 October, Frontex held a workshop on health and safety at the borders in cooperation with the Polish Border Guard, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the General Secretariat of the Arab Interior Ministers\u2019 Council (AIMC). The event provided an opportunity for dialogue and the exchange of best practices between national, regional and international entities dealing with border management, public health, and transport from both sides of the Mediterranean. It brought together over 50 experts from Arab countries, European Commission, EU agencies and member states. Discussions centred around improving cooperation in two main areas: across disciplines - between border guards, customs services and health authorities, across borders - to share information on early warnings and risk assessments in order to prevent the potential spread of viruses and other health risks between countries. Frontex and other EU agencies also highlighted the risk of environmental crimes at the borders, including bio-terrorism, smuggling of counterfeit medical products and forged health or vaccination certificates. \u201cI am glad that we could bring together so many experts to discuss health and safety matters in border management. Cross-border health threats can only be addressed if we work together,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri when opening the conference. \u201cFrontex, together with Member States, plays a key role in ensuring effective protection of the external borders of the European Union not only against cross-border crime, but also against health threats and the wider challenges that COVID-19 has brought to border control,\u201d he added. The event was organised within the framework of the EU4BorderSecurity project, funded by the European Neighbourhood Instrument and implemented by Frontex. Running until August 2023, the project seeks to enhance border security in North Africa and the Levant by fostering bilateral and regional cooperation.

Their main task is to escort persons who have received a return decision from national authorities, but also to identify and assist vulnerable groups or families with children. They have been deployed to Schiphol, an international hub that sees thousands of passengers every month, in the beginning of September. \u201cWith the standing corps, the EU\u2019s first uniformed service, we provide a tailor-made and flexible service to Member States. After Frankfurt and Fiumicino in Rome, this is the third international hub where Frontex sent its standing corps officers to assist with return operations. The forced-return escort and support officers working at Schiphol will not only support Dutch authorities, but also other Member States that use the airport as transit for their return operations,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri during his visit. The forced-return escort and support officers are experts who have completed specialized training prior to their deployment. They have also attended a one-week briefing at Frontex tailor-made for their deployment in Amsterdam and an additional week of training organised by Dutch authorities. The officers are trained in mediation techniques, first aid procedures, children and vulnerable groups protection. \u201cOn behalf of the Royal Netherlands Marechauussee I would like to welcome the forced-return and support officers at Schiphol Airport. I would like to underline the importance of the cooperation between Frontex and the Member States to strengthen EU\u2019s border management and to exchange knowledge,\u201d said Laurent Hendrickx, Director Operations Royal Netherlands Marechausse. Already now, Frontex assists Member States in the return of one in every five persons who had no right to remain in the EU. Last year, despite numerous restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Frontex assisted in returning more than 12,000 people not entitled to remain in the EU upon decision of the relevant national authorities.

The operation, known as EMPACT Joint Action Day (JAD) Danube, focused on combatting the smuggling of migrants, fighting trafficking in human beings and document fraud. A coordination centre was set up in Vienna to support the exchange of information among the participants and to lead investigations into people smuggling and trafficking in human beings as a result of the operation. On the ground, Frontex standing corps officers, along with customs, border guards and police officers from the participating countries were conducting border checks that brought impressive results. In just over a week, the operation led to: Arrest of 144 suspected people smugglersDetection of 6656 irregular migrantsDetection of 76 fraudulent documentsDetection of 13 stolen cars Trafficking in human beings is one of the most profitable forms of organised crime, generating billions of euros for criminal networks. Frontex plays an active role in combatting this crime through such activities as Joint Action Days but also through training border guards across Europe. The agency runs a number of operations at international airports, too, aimed at detecting and safeguarding victims of trafficking, especially children. Together with specialists in Trafficking in Human Beings (THB) prevention across Europe, Frontex created a manual for border guards and airport staff to help spot children who may be victims of trafficking. The operation was part of European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT), a four-year plan for the fight against serious and organised crime. It brings together police and law enforcement authorities of EU Member States, European agencies and international organisations to jointly strengthen Europe\u2019s borders and internal security.

Lithuania\u2019s land border with Belarus remains the most affected border section with 4116 illegal border crossings. Central Mediterranean Between January and August, national authorities registered around 41 000 illegal border crossings on the Central Mediterranean route, an increase of over 90% compared with last year. In August alone, there were 8790 detections, 61% more than in the same month of last year. Most of these arrivals were reported on the Libyan and Tunisian corridors. Here are some of the reasons for this significant increase. Western Mediterranean Meanwhile, Frontex has seen a slight increase in the number of detections on the Western Mediterranean route towards Europe. So far this year, 10 160 illegal entries have been detected, 16% more than last year. In August, 1526 illegal entries were detected, 27% fewer than last year. Most migrants on this route came from Algeria, Morocco and sub-Saharan Africa. Western Africa In the analysed period, Frontex has seen a significant increase on the Western African route. Between January and August, authorities detected 8562 illegal border crossings, an increase of 118% compared with last year. In August, 1008 illegal crossings were registered on this route. In 2021, most migrants originated from sub-Saharan Africa (67%), followed by nationals of Morocco. Western Balkans An estimated 27 180 illegal border crossings occurred on the Western Balkan route between January and August, 99% more than last year. The increase can be attributed to the resumption of migratory movements after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. Migrants from Syria, Afghanistan and Morocco accounted for most detections on this route. In August, an estimated 3980 illegal crossings were detected, 119% more than in the year before. Eastern Mediterranean The Eastern Mediterranean has seen a decrease in illegal border crossings after a peak in irregular migration in April 2021. In the first eight months of this year, the number of detections was about 11 030, 25% less than last year. In August, authorities in the region registered 1382 illegal crossings, 11% more than last year. The main detected nationalities were Syrians, Turkish, and Afghans.

It is a major security concerns and is thus central to law enforcement efforts and activities. Firearms fuel armed conflicts and terrorism. The most common form of gun trafficking involves small arms and light weapons, but the trade varies significantly from region to region due to the various firearms legislation in different countries. Illegal firearms enable other forms of crime by means of coercion and intimidation. Recent terrorist attacks in the EU, as well as accompanying seizures of firearms during various cross-border and inland operations, demonstrate the multidimensional and multi-criminal nature of this phenomenon. In Europe, the predominant type of firearms smuggling is the so-called \u2018ant trade\u2019 (cross-border smuggling of relatively small numbers of firearms and ammunition mostly using passenger cars), carried out by both organised crime groups and individuals, and often originating from post-conflict countries. Other trends have been increasingly observed in recent years, including the smuggling of easy-to-convert blank firing weapons or the online purchase of gun parts and components, delivered by postal services. In 2020, firearms smuggling was, like other fields of cross-border crime, affected by limited cross-border flows and changes in the intensity of checks. Most detections took place on entry, at land borders, in cars or hidden in travellers\u2019 luggage. The majority of ammunition and weapons seizures hence were not related to large-scale trafficking. With the limitation of non-essential movements and stricter controls, such incidents declined in 2020 \u2013 a side effect of the pandemic. Besides firearms and ammunition, seizures of cold arms, prohibited pepper sprays, electric shockers and other weapons were also frequently reported. While significant amounts of firearms are usually trafficked by sea, only minor detections were reported in 2020. Moreover, seizures on international flights were limited, since the risk of detection of such weapons at airports is higher due to the use of metal detectors, x-rays and explosives trace-detection (for both passengers and their luggage). The land borders with the Western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova and Turkey remained the border sections most at risk from firearms smuggling. While increased seizures by national authorities in neighbouring post-crisis areas might indicate that the EU\u2019s external borders are facing a greater threat, the same volume of smuggling could not be confirmed through detections at these borders. The situation on the EU\u2019s external borders is in line with the general global development. Several trends identified globally will pose challenges for border authorities. For example, the smuggling of firearms broken down into components is much harder to detect, and such smuggled special components and accessories can significantly alter the lethality and use of a firearm. Smuggled components can also complete a set of 3D-printed parts. Shipping by fast parcels further adds to the problem. The WCO report for 2019 highlights that 82% of all detections made by customs officers were based on risk profiling, while routine controls accounted for around 15%, but generally led to larger volumes of seizures. Such conclusions once again underline the significance of cooperation with all EU and international partners, as well as with border guard and customs authorities, bridge existing information and intelligence gaps, and ensure an appropriate, com-prehensive and tailored response to transportation at the borders through detailed checks of travellers based on profiling. Role of Frontex To effectively fight against criminal networks, law enforcement officers need to constantly improve their skills and stay up-to-date with the latest information on the ways the criminals operate. Frontex decided to help national border guard and customs authorities to fight arms-related crime and created the Handbook on Firearms for Border Guards and Customs Officers in cooperation with the border guard and customs community, as well as EU and international partners. The handbook provides the latest information on firearms trafficking, tactics and equipment to be used during border checks. The initiative was supported and guided by the European Commission, Member States and a number of EU and international organisations. The handbook was developed under the umbrella of the European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats (EMPACT). More information on the handbook is available here.

The agency has been working with the Parliament\u2019s scrutiny group in an open and transparent manner, sharing information and receiving the MEPs during an online visit to Frontex. The agency remains committed to cooperating with the European Parliament. \u201cI acknowledge the conclusion of Parliament's fact-finding scrutiny and its recommendations. Frontex is a bigger, more complex organisation than a couple of years ago, so a system that was designed in the past needs to undergo further transformation. The report underlined the challenges of the Agency\u2019s transformation in a more and more complex security environment,\u201d said Frontex Director Fabrice Leggeri. \u201cWe are determined to uphold the highest standards of border control within our operations. We will look into the recommendations and see how we can implement them to further strengthen the respect of fundamental rights in all our activities,\u201d he added. Frontex has completed two stages of the inquiry into last autumn\u2019s media allegations. Both an internal inquiry and the report by a special working group appointed by the Management Board (with Commission and Member states representatives) have found no evidence of any Frontex involvement in violation of human rights. The agency has already taken on board many of the recommendations issued by the working group, upgraded its reporting mechanism and reinforced its operational coordination centres to improve information exchange. It will continue working towards an effective and transparent management of EU external borders in full respect of fundamental rights. Recent events at the European Union\u2019s external borders have shown that Frontex is an essential assistance for Member States and the whole EU in situations of increased migratory pressure.

In June, Frontex has recorded 11 150 illegal border crossings at EU\u2019s external borders, 69% more than in the same month of last year. This significant increase can be attributed to the fact that a year ago countries had put in place various COVID-related movement restrictions. The highest increase occurred on the Central Mediterranean route, where smuggling networks resumed their activities in Libya and Tunisia. Central Mediterranean The number of migrants crossing the Central Mediterranean in June amounted to 4 700, double the figure from a year ago. Nationals from Tunisia and Bangladesh were the two main nationalities on this route so far this year.

The operation, which took place in June, focused on detecting excise goods smuggling via EU external borders, targeting tobacco smuggling. The officers also detected more than 400 innovative tobacco products, such as electronic cigarettes and e-liquids. Among the seized illegal goods were 6.7 million illegal cigarettes and 2.6 tonnes of raw tobacco, along with half-a-tonne of illegal drugs. 15 smugglers were arrested, and more than 200 forged documents detected. The experts from the Frontex Centre for Combatting Document Fraud were on call to help law enforcement officers from participant countries determine whether a document they held in their hands during border checks was fraudulent.

This is why combatting this crime is one of the key priorities for all law enforcement authorities in their duty to protect EU citizens and tackle serious and organised crime. To effectively fight against criminal networks, law enforcement officers need to constantly improve their skills and stay up-to-date with the latest information on the ways the criminals operate. Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, decided to help national border guard and customs authorities to fight arms-related crime and created the Handbook on Firearms for Border Guards and Customs Officers in cooperation with the border guard and customs community, as well as EU and international partners. The handbook provides the latest information on firearms trafficking, tactics and equipment to be used during border checks. It builds on the experience and expertise of EU and international partners and contains information related to firearms, their parts and ammunition, associated documentation, and the phenomenon of firearm trafficking itself. The initiative was supported and guided by the European Commission, both DG HOME and DG TAXUD, but also co-led by the European Firearms Expert Group, Poland, Slovenia and Romania. Other European and international organisations which supported the creation of the handbook include the Customs Cooperation Working Party, Europol, Cepol, Interpol, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, World Customs Organisation, OSCE, SEESAC and the EU\u2019s Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine.

As part of the operation aimed at detecting environmental crime, Frontex planes and vessels monitored nearly 1 000 vessels. The operation\u2019s tactical phase included the detection of 1,600 marine pollution offences, often triggering fines and follow-up investigations around the globe. Thousands of suspects, companies and criminal networks engaged in maritime pollution have been detected and investigated in a global INTERPOL-led operation.Operation 30 Days at Sea 3.0 (1-31 March) saw simultaneous action by 300 agencies across 67 countries resulting in an unprecedented 34,000 inspections at sea and inland waterways, coastal areas and ports to detect marine pollution violations.Frontline action followed five months of intelligence collection and analysis, enabling the identification of specific hotspots and suspects behind the criminal, deliberate pollution of the world\u2019s waterways.Preliminary results from the operation\u2019s tactical phase included the detection of 1,600 marine pollution offences, often triggering fines and follow-up investigations across all continents. These include:Nearly 500 illegal acts of pollution committed at sea, including oil discharges, illegal shipbreaking and sulphur emissions from vessels;1,000 pollution offences in coastal areas and in rivers, including illegal discharges of sewage, mercury, plastics, and other contaminants, leading to serious water contamination which flows into the oceans;130 cases of waste trafficking through ports.By using INTERPOL\u2019s wide range of databases and analytical capabilities, countries were able to connect pollution crime with other serious offences such as fraud, corruption, tax evasion, money laundering, piracy, and illegal fishing. With surveillance down, criminals are seizing opportunitiesWith many enforcement resources being reassigned to tackle the pandemic, criminals have been quick to exploit growing vulnerabilities in environmental security and reduced risk of detection.Authorities in Indonesia detected 65 oil spills and detained two vessels which tried to evade detection by turning off geolocation systems and concealing their national flags.A major criminal network trafficking plastic waste between Europe and Asia was exposed, triggering cooperation between authorities from both regions. So far, 22 suspects have been arrested and thousands of tonnes of waste have been prevented from being illegally shipped to Asia, where it would have likely been dumped, contaminating soils and generating considerable marine litter.Several countries from Europe, Asia and Africa reported illegal shipments of contaminated or mixed metal waste falsely declared as metal scraps. In one case, the Italian Coast Guard seized and prevented 11,000 tonnes of metal scraps mixed with plastic, rubber, mineral oil and other contaminants from being loaded onto bulk carriers headed for Turkey. Namibia, the Philippines and Croatia also reported cases of illegal waste shipments from Europe. Growing trends included COVID-19 disposable items such as masks and gloves, with 13 cases involving medical waste opened as a result of the operation.With the value of gold on the rise, agencies across Africa, Central and South America worked to track illegal mining, which often results in devastating contamination due to mercury discharges.INTERPOL Secretary General J\u00fcrgen Stock said: \u201cThe threat of pollution crime is constantly evolving, endangering the air we breathe, our water and soil. Although this is the third edition of 30 Days at Sea, it is never the same exercise.\u201cIt is thanks to a global yet agile network that we have seen the number of inspections more than double since the first edition: a clear sign that the international community will not stand for criminal attacks on our environment.\u201dINTERPOL will assist member countries in their follow-up operations and intelligence analysis with support from its Pollution Crime Working Group.Joining forces for greater impactWith INTERPOL\u2019s Environmental Security Programme coordinating the operation globally, Europol and FRONTEX (European Border and Coast Guard Agency) provided crucial support by coordinating the European leg of 30 Days at Sea 3.0, as part of the EMPACT action plan on environmental crime.Europol\u2019s Executive Director Catherine De Bolle said: \u201cMarine pollution is a serious threat, which endangers not only the environment but our health and in the long run our global economy. Criminals do not care about the environment; they do not think of tomorrow, but only of increasing their profits on the back of our society. Consolidated law enforcement efforts such as 30 Days at Sea are critical to tackle these borderless crimes and protect our environmental heritage for generations to come.\u201d\u201cEnvironmental crime is one of many criminal activities Frontex targets as part of our mission as the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. This is our contribution to the protection of the environment. I\u2019m proud that, as part of 30 Days at Sea, Frontex aerial and maritime assets monitored nearly 1 000 vessels,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.All three editions of Operation 30 Days at Sea have been carried out with funding from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad).Participating countriesParticipating countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Cote d'Ivoire, Croatia, Cyprus, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea Bissau, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Liberia, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Namibia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor Leste, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vietnam, Zimbabwe ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/operation-30-days-at-sea-3-0-reveals-1-600-marine-pollution-offences-worldwide-J1Y6n7"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0060", "date": "2021-03-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Artificial Intelligence - based capabilities for European Border and Coast Guard", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Artificial Intelligence - based capabilities for European Border and Coast Guard 2021-03-26 In 2019, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, commissioned RAND Europe to carry out an Artificial intelligence (AI) research study. The purpose of the study was to provide an overview of the main opportunities, challenges and requirements for the adoption of AI-based capabilities in border managament. Frontex\u2019s intent was also to find synergies with ongoing AI studies and initiatives in the EU and contribute to a Europe-wide AI landscape by adding the border security dimension. Some of the analysed technologies included automated border control, object recognition to detect suspicious vehicles or cargo and the use of geospatial data analytics for operational awareness and threat detection. As part of the study, RAND provided Frontex in 2020 with a comprehensive report and an executive summary with conclusions and recommendations. The findings will support Frontex in shaping the future landscape of AI-based capabilities for Integrated Border Management, including AI-related research and innovation projects which could be initiated by Frontex (e.g. under EU Innovation Hub) or recommended to be conducted under the EU Research and Innovation Programme (Horizon Europe).

Steinbeis 2i, together with three subcontracted partners (4CF, ERREQUADRO and WAT) will conduct a research study on the future opportunities that biometric technologies and biometric-enabled border control systems could provide to Frontex and the European Border and Coast Guard (EBCG) community. The purpose of the study will be to examine how to maximise future benefits of biometrics technology in border management while minimising its risks and ensuring full compliance with the existing legal, ethical and technological constraints. During the kick-off meeting, the research team presented the project plans, activities and expected outcomes. In addition to the overarching technology foresight exercise, the project includes developing a tailored foresight methodology and supporting tools, a biometrics taxonomy, and experts\u2019 consultation activities. The project\u2019s outcomes will be disseminated among the European Border and Coast Guard community and other partners interested in the application of novel biometric technologies within their domains.

Western Africa Nearly 2 100 irregular migrants arrived on the Canary Islands in the first month of this year, more than twice the figure from January 2020. However, the number was not included in the monthly total for illegal border crossings into the European Union because it is a preliminary figure. Nationals from Mali and Morocco accounted for most of the arrivals. Central Mediterranean The Central Mediterranean saw a 51% drop in illegal border crossings in January compared to a year ago to fewer than 900. Nationals of Guinea and Ivory Coast were the top two nationalities on this migratory route. Western Mediterranean Sea There were 600 detections of illegal border crossings in the Western Mediterranean in January, 48% fewer than a year ago. Algerians and Moroccans accounted for 90% of all detections on this route this year, while Moroccans were the second most represented nationality. Eastern Mediterranean According to the most recent data, there were around 750 detections of illegal crossings reported in January on the Eastern Mediterranean route, less than one-fifth of the figure from a year ago. Nationals of Syria, Nigeria and Cameroon accounted for the largest number of detected migrants. Western Balkans There were nearly 2 200 detections of illegal border crossings on the Western Balkan route last month, down 14% from January 2020. Syrians and Afghans were the top two main nationalities on this migratory route. *The figure includes other less active migratory routes not mentioned in this press release.

It also examined the links between climate change and organised crime, including terrorism. The seminar took place as part of the Frontex\u2019s presidency of the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Agencies Network that comprises nine European agencies. \u00a0\u201cThis is the first event of our presidency and the first time the JHA network focuses on climate change,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri opening the seminar. \u201cDuring today\u2019s seminar we do not want to look at the problem solely from the border guard or police perspective, but rather to focus on a more comprehensive picture \u2013 ranging from fundamental rights and law to security,\u201d he added. Climate change affects multiple dimensions of Justice and Home Affairs \u2013 it triggers and changes organised crime, with environmental crime being the fourth-largest criminal activity in the world. It also fuels migration, and experts assess that we will witness millions of people being affected by climate-related migrations in the coming years. The seminar\u2019s key goal was to develop a science-based approach to understanding how climate change influences individuals and societies, its impact on crime, migration and security and what EU agencies can do to minimise its negative effects. The online conference brought together delegates from JHA agencies and EU institutions, as well as invited internationally recognised experts and scientists dealing with environmental issues, including from The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, International Union for Conservation of Nature, Oxford Environmental Change Institute, Clingeldael and the Diversity Development Group. About the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Network The JHA network has an important role to play in Europe. It includes nine agencies: CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, EMCDDA, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA and Frontex. This year, the JHA network will focus on two topics \u2013 EU Green Deal and digitalisation, as well as a number of sub-topics. JHA agencies are the guardians of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Together, they contribute to the implementation of EU\u2019s objectives in the fields of migration, asylum and external border management, the fight against serious organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, gender equality and respect for fundamental rights.

We would like to set the record straight. The so-called \u201csecret\u201d documents cited by a German satirical TV show were provided to researchers by Frontex following a Public Access to Documents (PAD) request, demonstrating the agency\u2019s transparency. According to the mandate of Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, one of our main functions is to \u201cparticipate in the development and management of research and innovation activities relevant for the control of the external borders.\u201d This has been part of the Frontex mandate since 2016 (Regulation 2016/1624, art. 37) and reinforced in 2019 (Regulation 2019/1896, art. 66). \u00a0Strengthening this role, the Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs (DG HOME) and Frontex agreed a year ago for the agency to provide its expertise in the area of border security research and innovation to assist the European Commission in supporting the development of state of the art technology for the border and coast guard community (Memorandum of Understanding signed on 5 February 2020 between Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri and Director General of Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs Monique Pariat). The main format for interaction with the industry are Frontex Industry Days, which are organised on a regular basis. These events bring together representatives of the industry, researchers and representatives of Member States to explore a specific topic related to new technologies and innovations for the border guard community. Frontex and national authorities decide on the area of technological innovation currently of interest, after which an open call is made to industry. These events have been held at the Frontex headquarters, although over the last year the agency has shifted to a virtual format. The Industry Days are well publicised on the Frontex website and its social media channels. Many documents, information on participation and results of the Industry Days can be found in the website of Frontex, open for consultation to any interested party. Frontex has released numerous documents related to these events to the public and, as already indicated, as part of Public Access to Documents requests, demonstrating our commitment to transparency. The Industry Days provide a transparent platform to channel most contacts with the industry, replacing most bilateral contacts. They do not provide any opportunities for companies to lobby their interests. When companies interact with Frontex as part of the Industry Days, they do so in their research capacity. The Industry Days are in principle open to application to any industry/company, subject to the application and selection procedure that Frontex applies. Nevertheless, Frontex always considers the track record related to fundamental rights of the participants and make sure we only deal with reputable suppliers. Frontex invites representatives of border and law enforcement authorities from Member States to these events to learn about the latest technologies and innovations in their field of interest. The agency also regularly invites representatives of the European Commission at expert levels to Industry Days as well as other research and innovation meetings and events, along with EU agencies. Other participants have included representatives of international organisations such as UNHCR and IOM, depending on the thematic focus of specific events. Even if contacts with the industry are channelled through Industry Days, Frontex is currently developing a transparency register to disclose any meeting between its top officials and third parties related to procurements and tenders for services, equipment or outsourced projects and studies, as required by the agency\u2019s new regulation (2019/1896).

This was the lowest number of illegal border crossings since 2013. Syrians remained the most frequently reported nationality in 2020, followed by Moroccans, Tunisians and Algerians. Despite a rise early in the year, the Eastern Mediterranean migratory route ultimately saw the biggest fall in the number of arrivals, which fell by over three-quarters to around 20\u00a0000. The number of illegal border crossings in the Western Mediterranean region decreased by 29% to around 17 000. Meanwhile, the Canary Islands experienced a record number of arrivals of migrants on its shores in 2020, mainly because of a significant increase in the last four months of the year. In total, more than 22 600 illegal border crossings were detected on the Western African migratory route, eight times the tally from the previous year. This was the highest number since Frontex began to collect data in 2009.\u00a0 Smugglers often used large fishing vessels capable of carrying a larger number of people that departed from West African countries such as Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia. More migrants also took the Central Mediterranean route. Despite the stark increase in departures from Tunisia, slightly more irregular migrants detected on this route had departed from Libya. In total, the number of irregular arrivals in the Central Mediterranean almost tripled to over 35 600, making it the most active migratory route into Europe. The number of irregular migrants on the Western Balkan route rose by over three-quarters to around 27 000. The available data also indicates that male migrants accounted for a much larger share of the total number of irregular migrants arriving in Europe, with women making up fewer than one in ten detections.

The operation was co-led by Latvia and Finland and supported by INTERPOL, OLAF, Eurojust and Europol along with border guards, police and customs officers from Poland, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia. The operation, known as JAD Arktos 2, took place between 16-25 November and was coordinated from the Frontex headquarters in Warsaw. It targeted excise fraud, particularly tobacco smuggling, document fraud and migrant smuggling at selected border crossing points at EU\u2019s eastern land borders \u201cThe EU\u2019s eastern land borders have been used by organised criminal groups for smuggling excise fraud into the European Union for years. This is why it is so important to have customs take part in such operations, with their expertise and know-how,\u201d said Frontex Director Fabrice Leggeri. The EU\u2019s eastern land borders are significantly affected by cross-border crime. Smuggling of excise goods, trafficking in stolen vehicles and the smuggling of drugs and weapons remain the most significant threats to border security. While the migration pressure at the eastern land border remains low, criminals use the borders to smuggle illegal goods into the European Union. Authorities also detect high use of fraudulent documents. The aim of the Joint Action Day was also to enhance the cooperation between different authorities involved in the fight against cross-border crime. Despite the restrictions due to COVID, the operation led to impressive results: The operation was coordinated under the umbrella of the European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats (EMPACT) as part of the EU Policy Cycle, a four-year plan for the fight against serious and organised crime. It brings together police and law enforcement authorities of EU Member States, European agencies and international organisations to jointly strengthen Europe\u2019s borders and internal security.

Earlier today, the Heads of JHA Agencies came together for a virtual annual meeting, chaired by Eurojust, where they had a first exchange on Artificial Intelligence and digital capacity building, training tools and innovative learning. With the COVID-19 pandemic having served as a catalyst for teleworking and videoconferencing, the agencies agreed to explore avenues for closer cooperation in order to shape the digital future of law enforcement, border management and justice. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: \u2018Seven months ago the JHA agencies were unexpectedly faced with the enormous challenge of providing support to EU Member States in the completely new reality of a pandemic. I am genuinely impressed by how rapidly we adapted to digital working environments while making sure that the cooperation amongst our agencies continued as before. Now we have to take stock of what we have learned from this experience and move towards even greater digitalisation of our operational methods in the future.\u2019 All JHA agencies have been able to continue their operational activities during the COVID-19 pandemic with the help of readily available digital and online communication tools. The pandemic has given new insights into how these virtual ways of working can be optimised and, by sharing their experiences and best practices, the agencies now aim to make optimal use of existing capacities and expertise. At the same time, the increasingly important role of Artificial Intelligence in the agencies\u2019 operational activities calls for closer cooperation in this field. Following today\u2019s discussions, the Heads of JHA agencies agreed to draw up a list of upcoming challenges and opportunities for joint initiatives in the field of digitalisation. Aware of the resources that future digitalisation measures will inevitably require, they called upon the EU institutions to make sure that adequate funding is available. Eurojust chaired today\u2019s meeting and has made digitalisation a priority for the coming years. In close cooperation with the European Commission, the agency will work towards the full digitalisation of judicial cooperation in the EU. With interoperability, secure online communication channels and innovative technologies as its key ingredients, this Digital Criminal Justice project is expected to also benefit other JHA agencies and help streamline interagency cooperation.

The Management Board takes note of the report of the Executive Director on the \u201cRapid Border Intervention in the Eastern Mediterranean\u201d and of the fact that the Executive Director will ask further legal interpretations of EU regulations\u2019 provisions related to the operational activities at sea. In this context, the Management Board stresses that all operations of Frontex have to be carried out in full compliance with the applicable legal requirements, and in particular with fundamental rights, notably the principle of non-refoulement. To that aim, the Management Board asks the Executive Director to ensure that the internal reporting system is solid and effective in order to allow for an immediate follow-up in case of incidences. Furthermore, it supports the proposal of the Executive Director to beef-up the training in fundamental rights and to provide this training not only to Frontex-deployed staff, but also to the staff of the ICCs. Based on the initial proposal of the Executive Director to set up an evaluation committee, the Management Board concludes that urgent action is needed in order to investigate all aspects related to the matter. It decides to set up a sub-group to the Management Board to further consider these aspects, in line with the distribution of responsibilities under the EBCG-Regulation. The mandate of this sub-group will be elaborated in view of the discussion at the next Management Board meeting, and should among others also contribute to clarify existing arrangements raised on the interpretation of EU regulations\u2019 provisions related to operational activities at sea and the concerns raised by Member States about \u201chybrid threats\u201d affecting their national security at external borders. The Management Board expects that, pursuant to Article 46 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1896 on the European Border and Coast Guard, the Executive Director will suspend or terminate any activity, in whole or in part, if he considers that there are violations of fundamental rights or international protection obligations that are of a serious nature or are likely to persist. The Executive Director is asked to inform immediately the Management Board and the Fundamental Rights Officer of the Agency of any substantiated allegation that would come to his knowledge. The Management Board expects also that, in case such allegations would involve staff of the Agency, the Executive Director will take without delay all appropriate action. The Management Board calls on the Executive Director and the Fundamental Rights Officer ad interim to complete as soon as possible all the necessary steps to operationalize the fundamental rights framework as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/1896.

Ideas for opportunities of future cooperation between countries in the EU and the MENA region as well as international and regional organizations to fight these crimes and ensure protection was discussed. \u201cI am pleased to see our member and partner states from both sides of the Mediterranean coming together to discuss the crimes of trafficking and smuggling of children during this challenging time,\u201d said Ms.\u00a0Carmela Godeau, IOM Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. \u201cIOM continues to advocate for balanced and rights-based approaches to migrant smuggling, human trafficking and irregular migration in the MENA region and is working with governments on countering human trafficking.\u201d Over the past years, the Mediterranean region witnessed unprecedented levels of migratory movements, including those originating or transiting from countries of the MENA region towards the EU. This has increased the risk of migrant and refugee children of becoming victims of trafficking. This event was financed and organised in the framework of the EU4BorderSecurity project, which aims to enhance dialogue and cooperation in different areas of border management and security between countries of the EU and those of the Levant and the North of Africa. Terminology While the smuggling and trafficking of human beings can be interlinked, the two terms should not be confused. While THB means the recruitment and transportation of a person for exploitation, smuggling involves the facilitation of irregular entry of a person to another country for financial, or other material benefit.

In September, the number of illegal border crossings was 19% lower than in the previous month, reaching over 9 200. Central Mediterranean In September, the Central Mediterranean remained the most active migratory route into Europe with nearly 3 300 detections, although the figure nearly halved from the previous month. In the first three quarters of this year, the total number of illegal crossings on this route more than doubled to above 24 400. Tunisians have accounted for two out of every five illegal crossings via the Central Mediterranean, while Bangladeshis were responsible for one in five. Western Mediterranean There were nearly 2 300 detections of illegal border crossings in the Western Mediterranean in September, 9% more than in the previous month. The total for the first nine months of 2020 stood at nearly 11 000, or 40% less than in the same period in the previous year. Algerians accounted for nearly two-thirds of all detections on this route this year, while Moroccans were the second most represented nationality. Eastern Mediterranean According to the most recent data, there were around 780 detections of illegal crossings reported in September on the Eastern Mediterranean route, some 40% less than in the previous month. In the January-September period, the total number of detections dropped by almost three-quarters to around 15 300. Nationals of Afghanistan, Syria and Turkey accounted for the largest number of detected migrants. Western Balkans There were over 2 200 detections of illegal border crossings on the Western Balkan route in September, 22% above the figure in August. In the first three quarters of this year, more than 15 900 migrants were detected at EU\u2019s border with the Western Balkan countries, 100% more than in the first nine months of 2019. More than half of the irregular migrants detected in the region so far this year were Syrian, while Afghans accounted for another quarter of all detections at the EU borders here. *The figure includes other less active migratory routes not mentioned in this press release.

So far, no documents or other materials have been found to substantiate any accusations of violations of the law or the Frontex Code of Conduct by deployed officers. \u201cIn our conversation and contacts, I informed EU Commissioner Ylva Johansson that we are looking into the accusations levelled by several news organisations related to our activities at Greece\u2019s external borders. We aim to uphold the highest border guarding standards in all of our operations and do not tolerate any violations of the fundamental rights in any of our activities,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. \u201cWe remain committed to providing support to Greece at its external borders in line with our mandate and in the spirit of EU solidarity, in full respect of fundamental rights and international law,\u201d he added. Earlier this year, as part of an operational dialogue with Greece, the Frontex Executive Director had already asked its authorities to investigate two events near its islands in the eastern Aegean Sea. They found no proof of any illegal acts in one incident and are still looking into another one. Under its mandate, Frontex does not have the power to investigate and must rely on Member States. Executive Director Leggeri also alerted the members of the European Parliament of an incident earlier this year when a crew of the Danish vessels deployed by the agency was given incorrect instructions by the officers of the Hellenic Coast Guard. Following the incident Frontex contacted the Greek authorities and the misunderstanding was clarified with the Hellenic Coast Guard. At this point of time, the still ongoing inquiry has not identified other suspicious cases than those already reported by the Executive Director to Greek authorities.The situation in the eastern Aegean has been complicated for the vessels deployed by Frontex to patrol the external borders because of a disagreement between Greece and Turkey over their maritime borders. This has also affected search and rescue activities in the area. Despite all these increasing difficulties Frontex continues to save lives and has rescued 2 700 people this year.

The report outlines the main observations and recommendations that the Forum raised throughout the year with Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, and its Management Board to strengthen fundamental rights protection in Frontex activities. The Consultative Forum has and continues to express concerns over the absence of an effective monitoring system to prevent and address potential fundamental rights violations in the Agency\u2019s activities. The Consultative Forum views the implementation of the 2019 European Border and Coast Guard Regulation as an opportunity to address current concerns and has focused its recent engagement on the implementation of the Regulation. Adopted in 2019, the Regulation substantially extends Frontex\u2019s mandate and capacities, and consequently the Agency\u2019s possible impact on fundamental rights. It also obliges Frontex to strengthen its Fundamental Rights Office and recruit a minimum of forty fundamental rights monitors before the end of the year. The mandate of the Frontex Fundamental Rights Officer has also been extended to the investigation of potential fundamental rights violations. The Consultative Forum has also continued to advise Frontex on setting up a due diligence procedure that allows the Agency to comply with its obligation to suspend, terminate or not launch activities that could lead to violations of fundamental rights or international protection obligations. The publication of the Consultative Forum\u2019s annual report is in line with Article 108 of the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation. With a renewed composition, the Forum stands ready to support Frontex in promoting a rights compliant approach in its activities. The report is available here.

After reaching record lows in April due to restrictions related to COVID-19, the number of irregular migrants detected at Europe\u2019s external borders had been rising over the last three months. In July, the number of illegal border crossings rose by nearly a third from the previous month to 8650. The Central and Western Mediterranean regions saw twice as many arrivals as in June. Central MediterraneanIn July, the number of migrants reaching Europe using the Central Mediterranean route more-than-doubled from June to 4 650, in large part due to a significant rise in the number of irregular migrants departing from Tunisia. In the first seven months of this year, the total number of illegal crossings on this route rose to 13150, up 155% from the very low figures a year ago. Tunisians and Bangladeshis made up the largest portion of the detections in the Central Mediterranean. Western MediterraneanThere were around 1 500 detections of illegal border crossings in the Western Mediterranean in July, 84% more than in the previous month. Despite the rise last month, the total for the first seven months of 2020, was less than half the figure from the same period in the previous year at 6 100. The number Algerians, who accounted for one out of every two detections on this route this year, was seven times the figure from a year ago. Moroccans were the second most represented nationality on this route. Eastern MediterraneanAccording to the most recent data, there were some 400 detections of illegal crossings were reported in July on the Eastern Mediterranean route. This is 44% lower than the previous month, although the July total is expected to rise as final figures are calculated. Nevertheless, recent monthly totals are well below the levels from a year ago. In the first seven months of 2020, the total number of detections halved to around 12 900. Nationals of Afghanistan and Syria accounted for the largest number of detected migrants. Western BalkansThere were 2 550 detections of illegal border crossings on the Western Balkan route last month, 40% fewer than in June. The number of migrants crossing the Western Balkans has increased due to higher numbers of people who had originally landed in Greece and the easing of COVID measures by the national authorities in the region. In the January-July period, almost 11 300 migrants were detected at EU\u2019s border in the region, 80% more than in the first seven months of 2019.

In the past months, all JHA agencies have taken the necessary measures to ensure business continuity and uninterrupted operational support. At the same time, the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network (JHAAN), under the chairmanship of Eurojust, has initiated a dialogue to share their experiences in dealing with the pandemic and consider new avenues for closer cooperation among the agencies and with key stakeholders inside and outside the EU. \u00a0 The agencies\u2019 individual and joint efforts to deal with the impact of the pandemic have been captured in a Joint Paper on the COVID-19 response by the JHA agencies, which was formally endorsed by the heads of JHA agencies during a videoconference held on 9 July. During their meeting, the heads discussed the latest developments, including the fundamental rights implications of government COVID-19 measures, the quick adaptation of organised crime to the changing circumstances and the recent surge in drug use, domestic violence and child abuse. To tackle these and other issues more effectively related to the protection of citizens and freedoms, there is a need for increased interagency cooperation in the field of digitalisation and for sustainable financial resources in the coming years. The COVID-19 pandemic coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network. In the past decade, this family of JHA agencies joined forces as guardians of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Together, they contributed to the implementation of EU\u2019s objectives in the fields of migration, asylum and external border management, the fight against serious organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, gender equality and respect for fundamental rights.

The drop was especially pronounced on the Western and Eastern Mediterranean migratory routes. In June, the number of illegal border crossings was roughly in line with the previous month at nearly 4 500. Western Balkans The Western Balkans became the most active migratory route in June with 2 050 detections of illegal border crossings, 70% more than in May and nearly three-times the figure from a year ago. The number of migrants crossing the Western Balkans has increased due to higher numbers of people who had originally landed in Greece and the easing of COVID measures by the national authorities in the region.

Nevertheless, the final tally is expected to be close to May\u2019s figure and remain among the lowest totals recorded on this route since at least 2009. In the first six months of 2020, the total number of detections fell by nearly half to around 11 900. Nationals of Afghanistan and Syria accounted for the largest number of detected migrants. Central Mediterranean The number of migrants reaching Europe using the Central Mediterranean route last month fell by nearly 50% to slightly more than 900. But in the first half of this year, the total for the region reached close to 7 200, which is double the figure from the same period of 2019. This is in large part due to the higher numbers from the start of 2020 compared to very low figures from a year ago. Tunisians and Bangladeshis made up the largest portion of the detections in the Central Mediterranean.

And, with the shift in patterns of migration across the Mediterranean, we have also noticed a change in how these criminal groups are reaping their profits from the misery of migrants seeking to cross the sea. For a good part of the decade, it was the Central Mediterranean where criminal groups were seeing massive earnings. In 2017 alone, criminal networks smuggling migrants to Italy by boat generated nearly EUR 135 million in 2017, charging EUR 1 300 per person. In mid-2018, the smuggling fees increased to EUR 1 800 per person, while the overall income of the smuggling networks decreased to just over EUR 24 million in 2018, and to over EUR 12 million in 2019 due to a drop in the number of migrants. Meanwhile, smuggling networks operating the Western Mediterranean route saw their profits surge. While before migrants paid from EUR 500 to EUR 1000 to be smuggled from Algeria to Spain, and EUR 1000 to EUR 2000 from Morocco to Spain, from mid-2018 the fees reached EUR 3000 per person. This was in large part due to the fact that Sub-Saharan migrants, who usually pay larger amounts of money to smugglers, saw the Western Mediterranean as an alternative to the Central Mediterranean route. Those from West Africa started travelling to Algeria and Morocco, via Mali and Mauritania, and then further to Spain by boat. We estimate that while in 2017 people smuggling networks operating in Morocco took in nearly EUR 35 million, the following year they enjoyed a windfall of roughly EUR 105 million. As the number of people crossing the Western Mediterranean dropped in 2019 with fewer sub-Saharan migrants, criminal groups saw their income drop again to EUR 19 million. The price increase also led to a higher sophistication of the service provided by smugglers (for example, smuggling more people at once) and to an increase in the number of criminals involved. This, in turn, might lead to an increase of other illegal activities, such as money laundering, corruption or smuggling of goods. As the fees continue to rise, migrants might again start looking for cheaper alternative routes.

The fundamental rights monitors are an important preventive tool and FRA will provide its fundamental rights expertise to help establish them. The vacancy notices should be published as soon as possible so the monitors can be deployed,\" said FRA's director Michael O'Flaherty. In a ceremony that took place online, the two directors signed a Service Level Agreement in the virtual presence of Didier Reynders, Commissioner for Justice, Juan Fernando L\u00f3pez Aguilar, the Chair of LIBE Committee in the European Parliament and Georgios Koumoutsakos, Alternate Minister, Greek Ministry for Migration. Other participants included high-level representatives from Germany and the European Parliament, as well as the Chair of Frontex Consultative Forum on fundamental rights. The main tasks of the Frontex fundamental rights monitors will be to make sure all operational activities are in line with fundamental rights framework, monitor all types of operations and contribute to Frontex training activities. The monitors will be integrated with the agency\u2019s Fundamental Rights Office. The Frontex Fundamental Rights Officer will oversee their work and assign them to particular operations. By the end of the year, Frontex and FRA plan to establish a team of as many as 40 fundamental rights monitors. They will undergo enhanced fundamental rights training before they take up their duties next year, when Frontex will deploy the first members of the European Border and Coast Guard standing corps.

Today we remember how Europeans made history in 1950 and pay tribute to those who are currently making history in the fight against COVID-19. \u201cSeven decades ago Robert Schuman set out his idea for a new form of cooperation in Europe, which ultimately paved the way for the European Union. It is a momentous achievement that today helps protect 446 million citizens of its Member States. We\u2019re proud to do our part by making Europe\u2019s borders more secure,\u201d said Fabrice Leggeri, Executive Director of Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the need for solidarity across Europe and the crucial role of the EU in coordinating the European response. Such a response is essential when it comes to our borders. If we cannot control the external borders, we cannot control the spread of pandemics in Europe. Frontex plays a key role in ensuring effective protection of the external borders of the European Union not only against cross-border crime but also against health threats. It is already deeply involved in the fight against coronavirus, assisting EU institutions by developing guidelines, monitoring tools and risk analysis. The Agency continues to deliver despite the challenging times and maintains 900 officers, ships, aircrafts and other equipment at the EU external borders where they are needed most. The current pandemic has highlighted the fact that border management requires proper mobility management. This means that the newly formed European Border and Coast Guard standing corps will not only have to deal with irregular migration, cross-border crime or terrorism at the external borders but will also be a common European tool to better embed sanitary objectives under the umbrella of Integrated Border Management at EU external borders. Amid the ongoing crisis, Frontex, the European Union and Member States continue to prepare for the future by laying the ground for the deployment of first standing corps officers in 2021. They will wear a European uniform and take advantage of Frontex\u2019s own technical equipment. \u201cFrontex and the standing corps are EU\u2019s operational face on the ground, protecting its citizens by using the external borders as a filter, making the area of freedom, security and justice more sustainable,\u201d said Fabrice Leggeri.

The Greek government officially asked Frontex last night to launch a rapid border intervention at its sea borders in the Aegean.Rapid border interventions are designed to bring immediate assistance to an EU Member State that is under urgent and exceptional pressure at its external border, especially related to large numbers of non-EU nationals trying to enter its territory illegally. \u201cGiven the quickly developing situation at the Greek external borders with Turkey, my decision is to accept to launch the rapid border intervention requested by Greece. It is part of the Frontex mandate to assist a Member State confronted with an exceptional situation, requesting urgent support with officers and equipment from all EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. \u201cStarting next year we will be able to rely on the first 700 officers from the European Border and Coast Guard standing corps to provide operational flexibility in case of a rapid border intervention. Today, we depend entirely on EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries for contributions to come through at this crucial time,\u201d he added. Frontex has already increased surveillance capacity at the Greek borders and is redeploying officers from other operations to provide immediate assistance.Frontex is now working closely with Greece to quickly finalise the operational plan for the rapid border intervention.As soon as the plan is agreed, Frontex will ask other EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries to immediately provide border guards and other relevant staff from the rapid reaction pool, indicating the relevant profiles and numbers of officers from each.The interventions rely on the rapid reaction pools of 1500 officers and equipment from EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries, which are required to provide officers and staff within five days and equipment within 10 days.\u201cOur core mission is to protect the common borders of the European Union in support of Member States. In Greece, we contribute to this goal by supporting the registration of migrants and security screenings, which are also important for returns,\u201d said Fabrice Leggeri.

The thousands of men and women that will soon don a European uniform are a tangible expression of European solidarity - the recognition that protecting our common borders is a common task. I thank all the staff - present and future - who are working at the service of our Union. Looking forward, the Agency must now graduate into the fully fledged border force Europe\u2019s citizens expect their Union to deliver for them.

This is 92% below the record number set in 2015.\u00a0The number of irregular migrants crossing the Central Mediterranean fell roughly 41% to around 14 000. Nationals of Tunisia and Sudan accounted for the largest share of detections on this route.\u00a0The total number of irregular migrants detected in the Western Mediterranean dropped approximately 58% to around 24 000, with Moroccans and Algerians making up the largest percentage. Eeastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans Despite the general downward trend, the Eastern Mediterranean saw growing migratory pressure starting in the spring. It peaked in September and then started falling in accordance with the seasonal trend. In all of 2019, there were more than 82\u00a0000 irregular migrants detected on this route, roughly 46% more than in the previous year. In the second half of 2019, irregular arrivals in the region were at the highest since the implementation of the EU-Turkey Statement in March 2016, although still well below the figures recorded in 2015 and early 2016 with the situation before the Statement. Some persons transferred from the Greek islands to the mainland appear to have continued on the Western Balkan migratory route. There has been an increase in detections on the Greek-Albanian border after the start of the Frontex joint operation in May. In the second half of the year, a significant number of detections was reported on the EU borders with Serbia. In total, around 14\u00a0000 irregular crossings were detected at the EU\u2019s borders on the Western Balkan route last year \u2013 more than double the 2018 figure. On the Eastern Mediterranean route and the related Western Balkan route, nationals of Afghanistan and Syria accounted for over half of all registered irregular arrivals. Top nationality Overall, Afghans were the main nationality of newly arrived irregular migrants in 2019, representing almost a quarter of all arrivals. The number of Afghan migrants was nearly three times (+167%) the figure from the previous year. Roughly four out of five were registered on the Eastern Mediterranean route, while nearly all the rest on the Western Balkan route. The most recent available data also suggest a higher percentage of women among the newly arrived migrants in 2019. In the first ten months of last year, around 23% of migrants were women compared with 19% in 2018. EU countries counted approximately 14 600 migrant children younger than 14 in the January-October period, almost one thousand more than in all of 2018. \u00a0 Note: The preliminary data presented in this statement refer to the number of detections of irregular border-crossings on the external borders of the European Union.

Fundamental rights are at the core of all the agency\u2019s activities. They are integrated into the Frontex Codes of Conduct, the Common Core Curricula for border guards, specialised training for border surveillance officers or officers conducting forced return operations. The Code of Conduct obliges every officer who has a reason to believe fundamental rights of any person were violated, either by witnessing such violation directly, or by hearing about it, to report this immediately to Frontex in form of a Serious Incident Report. \u00a0 All reports related to potential violation of fundamental rights are immediately passed on to the agency and Fundamental Rights Office, an independent body established to advise the agency and monitor compliance with fundamental rights in all its activities. Frontex officers did write such reports in the past and the agency immediately contacted the authorities of the countries concerned and informed the European Commission. It should be noted however that while the agency can suspend an officer deployed by Frontex, it does not have the authority over the national border police forces nor does it have the power to conduct investigations in the EU Member States. All those measures \u2013 specific guidelines for officers, training, monitoring by independent experts, the Fundamental Rights Office and Consultative Forum (an independent advisory body on fundamental rights comprised of European and international organisations and NGOs) are intended to make sure the appropriate checks and balances are in place. Another such measure is the complaints mechanism which allows anyone who believes their rights have been violated by a Frontex deployed officer to lodge a complaint. The agency fully abides by the principle of transparency and provides access to its documents, to the general public. In the past years Frontex released hundreds of documents to EU citizens. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency is fully accountable to European institutions. Frontex reports on its activities to the European Parliament and the Council, and the two institutions exercise supervision.

Taking part in the opening in Senegal were representatives of Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, as well as other international partners. The role of the cells, which are run by local analysts trained by Frontex, is to collect and analyse strategic data on cross-border crime in various African countries and support relevant authorities involved in border management. This includes information on illegal border crossings, document fraud, trafficking in human beings and other types of cross-border crime. It is shared with authorities at national and regional level to produce analysis and policy recommendations, as well as with Frontex. The project is financed by the European Commission (DG DEVCO). Cooperation between Frontex and 26 members of AFIC is a key element in battling cross-border crime and security threats affecting African countries and the EU. AFIC was launched in 2010 to provide a framework for regular information sharing about migrant smuggling and border security threats. It foresees close cooperation with a number of countries along the main smuggling routes.

The main aim of the operation is to control migratory flows, to tackle cross-border crime, including migrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings and terrorism, and to enhance European cooperation at the land border between Albania and Greece. The officers and the equipment taking part in the Frontex operation will be posted at Albania\u2019s borders with Greece to support local authorities with border surveillance and border checks, including checking documents, as well as assisting in determining the nationality of migrants. The operational plan was consulted with Greece. As a general rule, the officers deployed by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency will perform all those activities in cooperation with and in the presence of Albanian officers. This will be complemented by training activities to develop regional border control capacities and by the exchange of operational information, professional experiences and best practices. At the start of the operation, the officers deployed by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency have been provided by Austria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Romania, Poland and Slovenia.

This is the second such event jointly organised by Frontex, the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). The Annual Coast Guard Event provides a platform for national authorities, the EU agencies involved in the cooperation on coast guard functions and the European Commission to exchange views on matters related to safety and security at sea. The discussions focused on information sharing and surveillance, analysing risks at sea and training of coast guard officers. \u00a0\u201cOur annual gathering highlights the growing cooperation on European coast guard functions,\u201d said Frontex Director Fabrice Leggeri. \u201cI would like to point out that our three agencies are working together as partners to provide increased operational support to the national authorities working at sea.

This is why we concentrate on fostering and improving the cooperation between the agencies and the national authorities to provide an improved maritime awareness environment and even better support to Member States.\u201d Another key challenge in the maritime domain is the fight against cross-border crime and terrorism. Frontex supports Member States through issuing alerts on high-risk vessels that might be involved in drug smuggling or other illegal activities. In the future, the agency will also buy and lease its own equipment, including coastal patrol vessels for multipurpose operations.

The total for the first two months of the year was roughly in line with a year ago at 11 800.Eastern MediterraneanThe Eastern Mediterranean route accounted for the largest percentage of detections of irregular migrants in February. Nevertheless, the number of migrants on this route fell 31% from the previous month to 2 250. Because of a high number of arrivals in January, the total number of detections on this route rose by one-third in the first two months of 2019 compared to a year ago to almost 5 500.Two out of every five detected migrants in this corridor were nationals of Afghanistan, usually arriving by sea. One out of every five was of Turkish nationality, mainly crossing the land border. Western MediterraneanRough weather conditions led to an 80% drop in the number of irregular migrants reaching Spain in February to 820. However, due to a high number of arrivals in January, the total for the first two months of 2019 stood at more than 4 900, or 83% above the figure from the same period of last year.Nationals of Morocco accounted for the largest number of detected migrants on this route.Central MediterraneanThe Central Mediterranean continued to experience falling numbers of irregular migrants. There were 60 migrants detected on this route in February, 70% less than in January. This was the lowest monthly number in nine years. The total for the first two months of the year reached 260, or 95% less than in the corresponding period of 2018, continuing the decreasing trend that began in the summer of 2017.Bangladeshis and Tunisians were the most represented nationalities reaching Italy.Western BalkansThere were more than 420 detections of illegal border crossings recorded on this route in February.

The total figure fell 27% from the previous year to 150 114 and was 92% below the peak of the migratory in 2015. This was in large part due to the dramatic fall in the number of migrants on the Central Mediterranean route, where the number of detections plunged 80% to 23 485. The Western Mediterranean became the most frequently used route into Europe. The pressure on Spain has been rising over the last years, and the number of detections in 2018 reached 57 034, double the number from 2017.\u00a0 The number of departures from Morocco increased five-fold. Most of the migrants taking this route last year came from sub-Saharan countries, but the number of Moroccan nationals also increased significantly. The Eastern Mediterranean saw only slightly fewer detections than the Western Mediterranean route. With 56 561 illegal border crossings, the pressure was 34% higher than in the preceding year due to the increase in land crossings from Turkey to Greece. The Western Balkans continued to be transited by irregular migrants trying to reach Western Europe from Turkey. Two main routes through the region stood out in 2018 with pressure shifting between them as border control activities were enhanced and reinforced in certain areas. Migrants travelled via both the central route via Serbia and the route stemming from the Greek- Albanian border section, along the Bosnian and Herzegovinian\u2013Croatian\u2013Slovenian corridor and, to a lesser extent, on Serbia\u2019s EU borders with Hungary, Croatia and Romania. Last year, Frontex began to collect detailed data on the gender and the age of irregular migrants. Nearly one in five of all the detected migrants last year claimed to be under the age of 18. The Eastern, Western and Central Mediterranean routes represented the main entry points for arriving children. This new development is crucial not only for a better monitoring and understanding of incoming migratory flows, but also for the effective identification of vulnerable groups. Risk Analysis for 2019 also presents various indicators related to the EU\u2019s external borders and migration in 2018.

People cross the EU\u2019s external borders more than 600 million times each year and global traveller flows are rising at an ever increasing rate. By 2025, the number of border crossings into the EU is expected to grow to almost 900 million, a third of which will be made by non-EU nationals. The evolution in travel needs and habits puts pressure on the EU\u2019s traveller processing capabilities, a situation further complicated by ongoing and emerging security threats. Smart borders will be a key solution to these challenges, making it crucial for both border guard and customs authorities to harness the power that innovative new technologies can offer. \u201cIt is becoming more and more difficult to rely on traditional means of border control to ensure an uninterrupted flow of travellers across the border on the one hand, and improved levels of security on the other,\u201d Fabrice Leggeri said. \u201cThe work of customs authorities around the world is vital to find effective and sustainable solutions to the risks emanating from cross-border crime and international terrorism, and our cooperation is becoming ever more important.\u201d One concrete example of this new technology is the forthcoming Entry-Exit System, which will register the entry and departure data of non-EU nationals crossing the external borders of EU Member States. The EU has also started working on the establishment of the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which will allow visa-exempt travellers to visit the Schengen area. Frontex will play a central role in running this simple, fast and user-friendly system, an important additional security safeguard for Europe. Frontex is already cooperating with customs in a number of fields, for example in the area of coast guard functions, joint operational activities, and training. There are also joint controls at some borders to facilitate cross-border cooperation, information sharing, and intelligence, for a more efficient risk analysis. The WCO and Frontex have been collaborating since 2014. The two organisations plan to further strengthen their cooperation in the future by signing a working arrangement, helping the border guard and customs community to combat cross-border crime more effectively.

As the agency expanded in recent years, it has strengthened its Fundamental Rights Office to continue monitoring that the rights enshrined in the EU Charter are respected by Frontex staff and deployed officers,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.Last year, the budget for the Fundamental Rights Office was six times the amount from 2017. Even excluding the funds to set up and run an effective Complaint Mechanism to ensure the monitoring of fundamental right in the areas of Frontex operations, the budget for the Fundamental Rights Office in 2018 was double the amount from the previous year.Similarly, the staffing of the Fundamental Rights Office has reflected the dynamic growth of Frontex. Since 2017, the number of staff working in the Fundamental Rights Office has doubled.It is important to note that the Consultative Forum praised Frontex for starting to collect detailed sex- and age-disaggregated data. This, as the Consultative Forum pointed out, makes it easier to identify vulnerabilities and improve the planning and implementation of the Agency\u2019s operations.The Consultative Forum on fundamental rights was created in 2012 to assist the Executive Director and the Management Board of Frontex in fundamental rights matters offering strategic advice on how the agency can improve the respect for Fundamental Rights in all its activities.

The report also presents observations and recommendations made to Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, and its Management Board in an effort to strengthen fundamental rights protection in the Agency\u2019s activities. The Forum welcomes the fact that Frontex began to collect detailed data on the gender and the age of persons crossing the EU external borders. This is an important step that will enhance the planning and implementation of operations and facilitate the identification and referral of children at risk. During the year, the Forum focused on the role of the Frontex Liaison Officers in non-EU countries in promoting fundamental rights standards, including during a visit to the Western Balkans. It also continued its work on gender and on child protection and safeguarding and issued a detailed recommendation on the role of Frontex in dealing with stateless persons in the context of its activities. The inadequate staffing of the Agency\u2019s Fundamental Rights Office remains a concern. The expansion of Frontex\u2019s mandate and activities exacerbates the need for an independent and well equipped Office to ensure that the activities of the Agency are fully in line with its fundamental rights obligations under the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation. The Consultative Forum encourages the Agency to revise the existing mechanisms to identify and address potential violations of fundamental rights in the context of its operations, as well as to ensure that its 2011 Fundamental Rights Strategy is updated. The publication of this report is in line with Article 70 (4) of the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation.

Thanks to the cooperation with Bulgarian customs, 700 kg of heroin was seized at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey, a record amount of drugs seized in that area. The operation, known as Joint Action Day (JAD) Mobile, took part at EU\u2019s eastern and Western Balkan borders. It brought together 16 EU member states and a number of non-EU countries and was coordinated by Frontex and co-led by Germany, Greece, Poland and Europol. International organisations, such as Interpol also supported the operation. JAD Mobile, which concluded on Sunday, zeroed in on stopping stolen cars and car parts, as well as related document fraud.

ETIAS is a system for granting authorisation to travellers who do not need a visa to visit the Schengen area. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency will set up and manage the ETIAS Central Unit, which will provide operational support, as well as reinforcing and coordinating border control activities in Member States. \u201cETIAS takes the concept of smart, integrated border management to a new level. Our new responsibility for the ETIAS Central Unit highlights the fact that beyond border checks, Frontex will be at the heart of a wider process to ensure internal security in the EU, in close cooperation with Europol and Member States,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.ETIAS will provide Member States with much-needed information about travellers exempt from visa requirements arriving at the external borders, enhancing security screening and improving risk assessment prior to travel.In running the ETIAS Central Unit, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency will have a number of responsibilities, including ensuring that the stored information is correct and up to date. Where necessary, the Agency will verify the travel authorisation applications in cases of a match against one of the databases checked during the automated process.

Over the last two years the agency has cemented its position as one of the cornerstones of the EU\u2019s area of freedom, security and justice, becoming more and more operational on the ground at Europe\u2019s external borders. More operational and more involved on the ground Currently the agency deploys some 1500 officers on average in its numerous operations at EU\u2019s external borders and over the last two years has doubled the number of its staff to more than 600. Twenty six ships are also taking part in its operations, along with six airplanes, four helicopters and numerous vehicles, including 80 patrol cars. \u201cI am proud to say that over the last two years Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, was able to deliver. We have become one of the most dynamic EU agencies with an extended mandate, more responsibilities and a larger staff. We are now on the front line of border management, including combatting organised crime. The bottom line is that Europe is only as secure as its external borders,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. Migration management and security Frontex has expanded its role in migration management and security-related activities. Since the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation came into effect on October 6, 2016, more than 27 500 people staying illegally in the EU have been returned to their home countries by Frontex. The agency has also introduced innovative types of operations to provide a variety of ways to conduct returns. It has expanded its assistance ahead of return operations, including obtaining the necessary documents for returnees. Frontex has also developed its foot-print in coast guarding activities and expanded its support for law enforcement at Europe\u2019s borders. Just this year, the agency assisted in the seizure of more than 100 tonnes of illegal drugs and arrests of more than 1000 suspected drug traffickers and 660 suspected people smugglers. The agency is working closely with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) and national coast guard authorities to develop truly European coast guard functions \u2013 from border control, to search and rescue, fisheries control and detection of pollution and all other kind of illegal activities at sea. Frontex has strengthened its response to document fraud. It has set up the Centre of Excellence for Combatting Document Fraud to support the identification, development and implementation of operational initiatives targeting this crime during Frontex coordinated activities, building a full-fledge capacity to further support Member States. Monitor risk and information To expand its ability to monitor the external borders and share the gathered information with EU Member States, Frontex has rolled out the Multipurpose Aerial Surveillance (MAS), which allows for planes monitoring the external borders to feed live video and other information directly to the Frontex headquarters and affected EU countries. The agency is also testing the use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) for border surveillance in several countries around Europe. The Frontex Situational Centre (FSC) now operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week and offers new EUROSUR fusion services to Member States, including satellite imagery and MAS. On the ground, the collection of intelligence on people suspected of cross-border crime, including terrorism, is now integral part of the agency\u2019s operations at the external borders. Frontex already shares a growing amount of information with Europol and EU Member States. Developing network of liaison officers To underpin this strategic engagement, Frontex has also made substantial progress in the deployment of a network of liaison officers to the EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries. Soon Frontex will have 11 liaison officers appointed and trained, ready to take on their tasks in the Member States. Frontex already has three liaison officers based outside the EU in areas affected by migratory flows \u2013 Turkey, the Western Balkans and Africa. The agency plans to deploy additional officers to countries outside the EU in the near future, starting by North and West-Africa and increasing its foot-print in the Western Balkans. Meanwhile, the agency has expanded its cooperation with non-EU countries in strengthening existing cooperation networks, such as the Africa-Frontex Intelligence Community (AFIC). Following the signing of the agreement on cooperation on border management between Albania and Frontex earlier this week, the agency will soon be able to launch its first operational deployment beyond the EU external borders. Contribute to the well-functioning of EU external borders To contribute to the well-functioning of external borders by addressing potential future challenges, Frontex has established a dedicated unit to handle the vulnerability assessment, which allows the agency to share information about potential weak spots in border control with EU Member States and to support them in tackling potential vulnerabilities, by so strengthening the level of security of EU external borders. Finally, thanks to its enhanced role in research, high-technology and innovation, the ETIAS regulation \u2013 that enters into force next week \u2013 gives to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency the responsibility to develop the ETIAS central unit. This new task stresses the agency\u2019s vocation to be the partner of the EU Member States and of the Commission to build and to run European modern and interoperable capabilities of border management.

Broadening this cooperation to other areas beyond migrant smuggling such as weapons trafficking, drugs smuggling and terrorism will allow both agencies to be more effective and consequently make Europe safer.\u201d The collaboration focuses on identifying complementary capabilities and expertise at Europol and Frontex and improving cooperation on the ground. Both Agencies will build up joint operational support and where possible will set up common procedures.Frontex is going to share information gathered at the external borders into Europol\u2019s criminal information hub. This structural exchange of information between the two Agencies will improve the work of border guards and support investigations. Efforts of both Agencies in the fields of research and development of new technologies will also be closely coordinated, for instance for the introduction of the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS).

According to Frontex Western Balkans Q1 report, in the first three months of this year the number of illegal border-crossings by non-regional migrants fell 10 per cent compared to the same quarter of last year, as well as in the last quarter of 2017. The continued pressure along the Greece-Albania-Montenegro-Bosnia and Herzegovina-Croatia sub-route remains indicative of migrants trying to bypass existing security measures along the main route via Serbia. 2017 Figures In all of 2017, the six Western Balkan countries reported 631 cases of document fraud, the second highest number since data collection began in 2009.As in previous years, non-regional migrants continued to attempt to enter the Western Balkans across the southern common borders with Greece and Bulgaria before heading north and trying to exit the region largely at the northern common borders of Hungary, Croatia or Romania with Serbia.Afghan and Pakistani were the two main reported nationalities, accounting for roughly 32% and 30%, respectively, of the overall number of detections involving non-regional migrants. Syrians ranked third in 2017 accounting for 8% of the total.The largest number of illegal border-crossings of regional migrants occurred at the common land borders between Greece, Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Cooperation between law enforcement authorities and enhanced border control measures were key to reducing migration pressure in the region. Firearms and drugs smugglingCannabis, mostly grown in the region and trafficked internally or to the EU, was the main smuggled narcotic substance in the region last year. More than 23 tonnes were detected by Albania, Montenegro Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. There were also 209 detections of smuggled firearms and ammunition. Most of them were detected in Serbia, followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina.Last year, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia dismantled two organised migrant-smuggling groups arranging the transportation of migrants from Greece towards Serbia and onwards.Read the Western Balkans annual risk analysis report.Read the Western Balkans Q1 report.

We are providing an increasing number of solutions to Member States, including return operations by commercial flights,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.\u00a0Although most return operations coordinated by Frontex are done on planes chartered by Member States, the agency has also been conducting a pilot project to organise returns by scheduled commercial flights. Earlier this month Frontex completed its 300th such operation, which allows national authorities to return non-EU nationals without the need to charter an entire aircraft.\u00a0So far, 11 EU Member States have benefitted from the pilot project, which has been extended to 30 June 2019.\u00a0Frontex is also about to begin to charter planes by itself for return operations, giving more flexibility to the agency and Member States.\u00a0Earlier this year Frontex, completed the 1000th return operation supported by the agency and 100th readmission operation from Greek islands to Turkey.\u00a0Frontex also provides a pool of experts who support the return of migrants across the EU. These include monitors for return operations who participate in more than half of all joint return operations and almost all collecting return operations (with participation of third country escort officers). The role of monitors is to observe the operation and make sure it is conducted in line with applicable provisions on human rights, as well as report on its implementation from an independent perspective.

Trafficking in human beings is one of the most profitable forms of organised crime, generating billions of Euros for criminal networks.Often a border guard is the first \u2013 and sometimes only - law enforcement officer that a victim of human trafficking may ever come in contact with. This is why Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, trains border guards across Europe on how to detect potential victims of trafficking and refer them to national authorities. The agency also organises operations targeting this crime. Last month, Frontex, along with nine other EU agencies, signed a renewed commitment to continue assisting EU Member States in implementing the EU Anti-trafficking Directive, stepping up prevention in addressing the whole trafficking chain and countering the culture of impunity of perpetrators. The agencies also committed to improving victims' access to their rights, adopting a gender-specific and child-sensitive approach and intensifying coordination efforts, information sharing and training.\u201cTrafficking in human beings is a global problem that requires a coordinated response,\u201d said Frontex Deputy Director Berndt Koerner. \u201cOn the World Day against Trafficking in Persons, together with other EU agencies, we are committed to continue fighting against this crime with all our available means,\u201d he added.\u00a0 Since last year, Frontex has been organising workshops on THB for border and coast guards deployed by Italy and Greece. The officers gather information on criminal groups and pass it on to national police and Europol to conduct investigations. On the operational level, Frontex supports the fight against THB in operations called Joint Action Days, which are regularly organised under the umbrella of the European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats (EMPACT) as part of the EU Policy Cycle.Frontex also runs a number of operations at international airports aimed at detecting victims of trafficking, especially children. Together with specialists in THB prevention across Europe, Frontex created a manual for border guards and airport staff to help spot children who may be victims of trafficking. Most of the victims of human trafficking in the EU come from Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly from countries in West Africa. The worrying scale of human trafficking from African countries and the arrival of unaccompanied or separated children who may be at\u00a0 risk\u00a0 of\u00a0 THB,\u00a0 brings\u00a0 to\u00a0 light\u00a0 the\u00a0 vital\u00a0 role of border guards in the fight against human trafficking.

Through its new mandate, Frontex has been transformed into a fully-fledged internal security actor with far greater scope for action in the area of cross-border crime, including counter-terrorism. The Agency is therefore now in a position to assist its partners in upgrading its border management systems and increasing the ability of national authorities to apprehend and prosecute people smugglers, detect false documents, and spot potential terrorists.Even as border authorities are under enormous pressure to strengthen their border management systems, the complexity of border management is being influenced by new technological innovation, a topic of focus throughout the conference.\u00a0 \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so many years ago that we were just getting used to information exchange, and familiarising ourselves with the information technology used in this field,\u201d said Frontex Deputy Director Berndt K\u00f6rner. \u201cNow, though, we are focusing on interoperability and interconnectivity, on targeted information, on actionable information and on manageable information quantities.

Over 150 officials participated in the event, including directors of border guard services at Europe\u2019s major international airports. One of the topics of discussion was the introduction of the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) which is expected to be implemented by 2020. Together with eu-LISA and Europol, Frontex is already preparing for the implementation of ETIAS, which will provide an additional layer of control by determining whether visa-exempt non-EU nationals are eligible to travel to the Schengen Area. ETIAS will help improve internal security, limit public health risks and reduce delays at the borders by identifying persons who may pose a risk before they arrive at the EU\u2019s external borders. The conference also focused on combatting document fraud at airports. To assist Member States in detecting counterfeit travel documents, Frontex introduced the newly established Centre of Excellence for Combating Document Fraud.

The annual total of 204 700 marked a significant decrease compared to recent years, but not yet a return to the situation before 2014, when figures ranged between 72 000 and 141 000 detections.While the comparison on the annual basis shows that the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkan routes had the biggest decline in absolute numbers, the most significant development of last year was the sudden plunge in the number of illegal border crossings on the Central Mediterranean. The sudden reversal on this route took place in July.In contrast with the three major migratory routes, the number of detections in the Western Mediterranean reached an unprecedented high, more than double the previous record from 2017.Corresponding to the changes on the migratory routes, the relative share of African nationals increased compared with 2016, driven by fast-growing numbers of migrants from Maghreb countries (notably Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia) in the second half of the year. As a result, African nationals accounted for almost two-thirds of irregular migrants arriving at the shores of the EU.Risk Analysis for 2018 also presents various indicators related to the EU\u2019s external borders and migration in 2017.

They were supported by Eurojust, Interpol, and other international partners. Operation Dragon has been the fourth cooperative international law enforcement operation under the EU Policy Cycle targeting serious and organised crime in the EU and globally, and involved actions in hundreds of locations between 5 June and 20 October 2017.\u00a0 EU Member States and their international partners came together to disrupt the activities of criminal groups involved in crimes including: payment card fraud, facilitation of illegal immigration, cybercrime, drugs trafficking, firearms trafficking, euro counterfeiting, organised property crime, excise fraud and trafficking in human beings. Law enforcement authorities assigned thousands of police, border and coast guard, and customs officers to counteract those crimes. Frontex supported Operation Dragon according to its mandate focusing on combating migrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings and other types of cross-border crime, such as smuggling of cigarettes, firearms and detection of stolen vehicles at EU's land, sea and air borders. Operation Dragon comprised of seven targeted operations called Joint Action Days. Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, coordinated three, co-led one and participated in two more.

According to preliminary data, there were some 204 300 illegal border-crossings in 2017, 60 percent fewer than the previous year. Meanwhile, Spain saw the number of irregular migrants detected at its Western Mediterranean borders more than double to the highest level since Frontex began systematically collecting data in 2009. Central MediterraneanThe sudden plunge in the number of irregular migrants reaching Italy in mid-2017 was arguably the most significant development at the external borders of the EU since the implementation of the EU-Turkey statement in March 2016. After the monthly totals in the first half of 2017 roughly mirrored those seen a year earlier, the figures dropped suddenly starting in July. The total for the year stood at an estimated 119 000.Nigerians accounted for the most arrivals on the Central Mediterranean route, accounting for about one out of every seven migrants.

However, the number of detections in the second half of the year was higher than in the same period of 2016. This reflected the continued attempts by smuggling groups to circumvent border surveillance in spite of sustained commitment of the Turkish authorities to border management.In all of 2017, there were some 41 700 detections of illegal border-crossings, both at sea and land borders, less than a quarter of the total in 2016.Syrians and Iraqis remained the top two nationalities arriving in Greece last year on the Eastern Mediterranean route.\u00a0Western MediterraneanWhile the other two key sea routes into Europe saw a drop in migratory pressure in 2017, the number of migrants detected reaching Spain from northern Africa hit a new record high of nearly 22 900. This was more than double the previous record set in 2016.The situation in the Rif region of Morocco, the main transit country for migrants heading to Spain, created an opportunity for more departures from its western coast in the second half of the year. This was coupled with a growing use of high-capacity boats capable of transporting large numbers of migrants.Almost 40% of the migrants were nationals of Algeria and Morocco, whose numbers have been on the rise since the middle of 2017.

The two-day conference brought together experts from around the world to discuss the phenomenon of fraudulent travel documents and ways to work together at the national, European and international level to combat this criminal activity. The two organizations will expand their respective initiatives to improve frontline document checks and tackle document fraud, which facilitates serious crimes such as human trafficking and terrorism. \u00a0\u201cDocument fraud is a global phenomenon, which requires a global response. The effective control of travel and identity documents at the borders is therefore a fundamental component of internal security and successful migration management. Particularly because of its importance for border control, Frontex stands at the forefront in the fight against document fraud at the European level,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri during the opening speech. To address this threat, Frontex has been active in combating document fraud at the external EU borders and on the secondary movements of irregular migrants. These activities include risk analyses, deploying document experts in joint operations, supporting the identification of migrants in hotspots and training border guards in Member States in detecting fraudulent documents. Since May this year all these activities have been supported by a group of 85 experts in document fraud from European Union Member States. \u201cInterpol and Frontex have a long history of cooperation - throughout the last 8 years Interpol has assisted many Frontex operations at air, land, and sea borders within the EU.

During the operation also smuggled cigarettes, alcohol and drugs were detected, along with weapons and ammunition. The intelligence collected during JAD Dual will be used in investigations into criminal networks involved in migrant smuggling. Frontex-coordinated European Border Guard Team Members deployed at selected border crossing points at EU\u2019s external land borders participated in the action along with customs authorities from several member states, Europol and Interpol experts. The JAD Dual was coordinated under the umbrella of the European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats (EMPACT). JAD Dual is one of many joint action days taking place this year, which collectively are called Operation Dragon 2017. They bring together police and law enforcement authorities of EU member states, European agencies Frontex and Europol, as well as Interpol. A coordination centre was set up in Vienna to bring together liaison officers from member states dealing with migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings and support investigations. The operation took place in Austria, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Serbia and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

During the gathering, Frontex launched a project to develop the capacity of AFIC countries to work on joint intelligence analysis of crime. This project will focus on training experts and setting up AFIC Risk Analysis Cells (RACs). It is funded by the European Commission.\u201cCriminal networks are increasingly crossing national borders. None of us can manage the threats they pose to our countries and societies alone. There is little doubt that the increasingly international criminal groups require a global, cross-border response,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.\u201cBut for this to happen it is necessary to strengthen cooperation between all affected countries. This will help dismantle organised crime networks engaged in people smuggling and trafficking in human beings,\u201d he added.Participants discussed border management and security, building better awareness of the situation at the African borders and exchange of information about migratory movements. The Africa-Frontex Intelligence Community (AFIC) was set up in 2010 to provide a framework for regular information sharing about migrant smuggling and other border security threats affecting African countries and the EU. It foresees close cooperation with a number of countries along the main smuggling routes. This is done through a series of training and capacity building activities to develop national and regional strategies to fight cross-border crime and setting up integrated border management systems, as well as improving the collection, sharing and analysis of relevant data. This week\u2019s meeting in Warsaw was the third of a series of workshops organised this year. The previous ones took place in Niger and Spain (Canary Islands). As a result, Frontex produces reports that analyse the irregular migratory movements affecting African countries which are part of the AFIC network, cross-border criminality and provide an overview of the main regional security threats. The countries include Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Togo. Other participants of this week\u2019s meeting included representatives of Europol, the European Commission, European External Action Services, EU Integrated Border Management Assistance Mission in Libya (EUBAM Libya), EUCAP SAHEL Mali, EUCAP SAHEL Niger.

The agency\u2019s new mandate and increased resources were a clear and strong political response not only to the migration but also the security crisis faced by the EU at its external borders in 2015 and 2016. The agency\u2019s first anniversary provides an opportunity to review its achievements and consider the way forward.\u201cThe new Frontex is more operational than ever. Right now we have more than 1700 officers from all around Europe deployed in our operations. In case of an emergency at Europe\u2019s external borders, Frontex has at its disposal additional 1500 officers who can be deployed within five days, not weeks or months,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.The European Border and Coast Guard Agency is building on the foundation of Frontex, which for more than a decade helped coordinate operations at Europe\u2019s external borders. The agency has expanded and reorganised to be able to better handle its new responsibilities. Just over the last year, Frontex has grown by a third, to a staff of 488, and it will more than double again, with a goal of having 1000 employees by 2020.To help Europe better prepare for future challenges at its external borders, Frontex is conducting vulnerability assessments in all member states. In these tests, Frontex analyses border control capacity to determine individual countries\u2019 readiness to face challenges at their external borders. The agency then issues individual recommendations to member states. The vulnerability assessment is an important part of the agency\u2019s mission to help EU manage migration more effectively, improve the internal security of the European Union and safeguard the principle of free movement of persons within the Schengen Area.The agency has also taken on new tasks to help combat cross-border crime. Frontex closely cooperates with national authorities and Europol and shares the intelligence gathered at the external borders with them. Under the new mandate, officers deployed by Frontex now have access to various EU databases, including the Schengen Information System (SIS), which allows them to perform more effective border checks. In the coming weeks, together with the member states and the European Commission Frontex will take further steps towards an integrated European Return System. So far this year the agency has assisted in the return of more than 10 000 foreign nationals, nearly double the number from all of 2016. Under its new mandate, in addition to coordinating joint return operations that involve at least two Member States, Frontex has begun to assist individual Member States in national return operations. These now account for nearly half of all Frontex return operations. Frontex has also established a pool of experts who support the return of migrants across the EU. \u201cFrontex is more involved than ever in different stages of migration management in the EU. Over the last year, Frontex has taken large leaps in the area of returns and has become an essential actor in law enforcement on the European level,\u201d said Fabrice Leggeri.See \"A year in review\" report.

During the event, member states, partner countries, international and European organisations, as well as experts came together to discuss how e-training can facilitate the education of border and coast guard officers across the EU. Frontex presented its recent developments and achievements in the area of training. Last year, the agency\u2019s experts trained more than 1200 officers in fields such as border surveillance at land and sea, training for return specialists, nationality screening and detection of falsified documents. The agency also presented planned training activities for 2018.Educational technology is an effective way to facilitate training in a community of tens of thousands of border and coast guard officers. Instant access to training resources, flexible learning time, libraries of digital content, the use of artificial intelligence and virtual reality create opportunities to share knowledge and best practices through online collaboration platforms. In this way officers can quickly and efficiently acquire the knowledge needed to be deployed in operations along EU\u2019s border. One of the key tasks of Frontex is to develop training curricula for border guards across the EU to help harmonise border control in all member states. With its new mandate, the agency can now quickly deploy hundreds of officers to help member states secure the external EU border, at land, air or sea. However, the deployment of large number of officers over a short period of time requires a new approach to training using e-learning technology.

After a significant drop over the last two months on this route, the total of arrivals for the eight months of this year stood at 99 800, down 13% from the same period of last year.So far this year, nationals of Nigeria and Guinea made up the largest number of the detected migrants on the Central Mediterranean route, which accounts for two-thirds of illegal border crossings into the EU.Western MediterraneanThe number of detections of illegal border crossings in the Western Mediterranean in August by both sea and land reached an estimated 2 400, more than twice the figure from a year ago. Despite a small decrease in the number of detections in August compared to the previous two months, migratory pressure on the Western Mediterranean route remains high. In the first eight months of the year, the number of migrants crossing into Spain stood at an estimated 13 600, nearly three times the figure from the same period of 2016.The most migrants detected on this route this year have come from Morocco, Ivory Coast and Gambia.Eastern MediterraneanThe number of migrants arriving in Greece in August stood at 4 200, nearly a quarter more than in the previous month. In the first eight months of this year, roughly 21 100 migrants reached Greece, about a tenth of the figure from the same period of 2016.Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans accounted for the majority of detections on the Eastern Mediterranean route in 2017.Western BalkansIn August, the Western Balkans route saw a relatively low number of detections of illegal border-crossings.

Spain continued to see the heaviest migratory pressure since 2009.The total number of detections in the first seven months of 2017 fell by two-thirds from the same period of last year to 127 100. Central Mediterranean In July, the number of migrants arriving in Italy through the Central Mediterranean route fell 57% compared to the previous month to 10 160, the lowest level for the month of July since 2014. After last month\u2019s slow down, the total of arrivals for the first seven months of this year stood at 93 900, roughly in line with the same period of last year. Several factors contributed to the significant drop in activity on the Central Mediterranean route in recent weeks, including worse sea conditions in the first half of July. Clashes near Sabratah, a key departure area in Libya, have also affected the smuggling operations there. In addition, increased presence of the Libyan Coast Guard also discouraged the people smugglers from sending out boats with migrants. Nationals of Nigeria, Guinea, Eritrea, Sudan and Mail made up the largest number of the detected migrants on the Central Mediterranean route last month. In the first seven months of this year, Nigerians also represented the highest number of arrivals, accounting for one out of every six irregular migrants reaching Italy by sea. They were followed by nationals of Bangladesh, Guinea and the Ivory Coast. Western Mediterranean The number of detections of illegal border crossings in the Western Mediterranean in July reached an estimated 2 300, more than four times the figure from a year ago. This brought the total for the first seven months to around 11 000, already exceeding the number for all of 2016. One of the main reasons for the increase in sea and land crossings on the Western Mediterranean route was increased instability in the countries of origin and transit. In addition, the dismantling of makeshift camps in Morocco and Algeria acted as \u201cpush factor\u201d in displacing migrants to other areas.

The meeting addressed the increasing problem of document fraud as a key element for all types of criminal activity, as well as terrorism. Europol\u2019s Executive Director Rob Wainwright said: \u201cIn the last few years document fraud has become a major criminal problem in Europe, helping to drive new shifts in the scale and impact of migrant smuggling, fraud, terrorism and other security threats. Professional criminal syndicates are now part of the large-scale production, trading and distribution of often high-quality identity and other official documents. Europol is pleased to support this new initiative between the Member States of the EU and other partners to crack down on this problem.\u201d\u201cDocument fraud at the European Union\u2019s external borders can ultimately undermine its internal security. Frontex will do its utmost to support the Council initiative, also by providing the expertise gained in our operations. Right now, we have 74 specialised document experts deployed at Europe\u2019s borders,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.\u00a0Combatting document fraud, and targeting the organised crime groups involved in producing and providing fraudulent and false documents, is one of 10 priorities for fighting organised and serious international crime between 2018 and 2021, as set by the Council of the EU. The Council decided that this would be implemented as a cross-cutting priority, following Europol\u2019s SOCTA\u00a0and recommendations by COSI. According to Frontex, document fraud constitutes a serious problem on entry at the external borders of the EU.This is the first time an EU crime priority will not be implemented through a specific \u2018Multi Annual Strategic Plan and Operational Action Plan\u2019, but instead through a common strategic goal in all relevant operational plans covering other criminal areas. This should make it possible to tackle the phenomenon in the comprehensive way by police, border and coast guard, and customs experts.\u00a0To streamline their work, the EU Council decided to create the Horizontal Expert Working Group on Document Fraud. The working group comprising Member States, Frontex and Europol experts, will provide support in fighting all types of document fraud, including travel and identity documents, \u2018breeder\u2019 documents (serving as a basis to obtain identification documents fraudulently), other types of ID fraud, administrative and official documents of any kind that are subject to fraud by organised crime groups.\u00a0The meeting began with welcome speeches from the Executive Directors of Frontex, Europol and the French National Police, followed by presentations on the EU Policy Cycle, a situational picture of document fraud and existing initiatives.

Within Operation Triton, Frontex deploys officers who collect intelligence about the activities of the smugglers which the agency shares with Italian authorities and Europol for investigations and arrests,\u201d said Fabrice Leggeri.In 2016, 588 suspected smugglers were arrested as part of operation Triton.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/5-vessels-deployed-by-frontex-engaged-in-rescue-operations-in-central-mediterranean-sJnCVI"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0266", "date": "2017-07-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Frontex helps Italy track down people smugglers", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Frontex helps Italy track down people smugglers 2017-07-20 A plane taking part in Frontex activities in the Central Mediterranean played a key role in the arrest of two suspected people smugglers who had earlier dropped off 33 migrants near Syracuse, Sicily.The Italian authorities had asked Frontex to dispatch the plane, which streams real-time video to the agency\u2019s headquarters, to help find the smugglers on sailboat that was heading away from Sicily. The plane spotted the suspected sailboat heading away from the island. The migrants later confirmed that the vessel was the one involved in the smuggling operation and Italian authorities intercepted it the same day. Expanding the agency\u2019s ability to track vessels and monitor the sea in real time, the plane provides streaming video and other data directly to Frontex as part of a unique multipurpose aerial surveillance (MAS) operation launched last month. The real-time video is transmitted to the Frontex Situation Centre (FSC) at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Warsaw, where it is monitored by Frontex staff, along with representatives from the Italian law enforcement authorities and Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre.The information provided by the plane is used to assist in tracking suspected criminal activity in the Central Mediterranean, but may also be used to provide assistance in search-and-rescue missions in the area. In case of such an emergency, the video and other data would be shared with relevant national authorities, which coordinate all search-and-rescue efforts.In addition, the plane may also assist the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) in tracking down illegal fishing as part of the cooperation on multi-purpose operations.VESSEL TRACKING CAPABILITIESIn a separate incident last month highlighting the growing capabilities of tracking down smaller vessels as part of Frontex operations, 73 migrants in two rubber boats were rescued after they were spotted by a Portuguese aircraft patrolling the Western Mediterranean as part of Frontex Joint Operation Indalo. One of the boats was also detected in satellite images taken as part of Frontex\u2019s Eurosur Fusion Services.The migrants, including women and children, were rescued by the Spanish authorities and were brought to safety in the Spanish port of Motril.The rescue highlights the growing capabilities of the Vessel Detection Service (VDS), one of Eurosur Fusion Services that uses satellite images to track suspicious vessels or those in distress. VDS have been recently upgraded to provide enhanced capacity to detect smaller vessels at sea, such as the two rescued rubber boats. Eurosur Fusion Services support Member States\u2019 ability to observe activities at and beyond the EU external border and to react more quickly. They are delivered in cooperation with other EU Agencies - European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), European Union Satellite Centre (SatCen), European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA), as well as commercial partners. Several of the activities are supported by the Copernicus Programme, an EU initiative for earth observation.

The total number of detections in the first half of 2017 fell 68% from the same period of last year to about 116 000, although the number of migrants arriving in Italy and Spain remained above the figures from a year ago. Central MediterraneanIn June, the number of migrants arriving in Italy through the Central Mediterranean route rose by 8% from May to 24 800. This brought the total for the first six months of the year to 85 000, 21% higher than the figure from the same period of 2016. Nationals of Nigeria and Guinea accounted for the largest number of the detected migrants on the Central Mediterranean route last month. In the first half of this year, Nigerians also represented the highest number of arrivals, followed by nationals of Bangladesh, Guinea and the Ivory Coast.Eastern MediterraneanThe number of migrants arriving in Greece by both sea and land routes in June stood at 2 600, similar to the figure from the previous month. In the first half this year, roughly 9 000 migrants reached the Greek islands, 94% fewer than in the same period of 2016.While the number of landings on the Greek Eastern Aegean Islands last month slightly decreased compared to May, the number of detections of illegal border crossings at Greece\u2019s land border with Turkey rose significantly.Syrians, Pakistanis and Iraqis accounted for the majority of detections on the Eastern Mediterranean route in June.Western MediterraneanThe number of detections of illegal border crossings in the Western Mediterranean nearly tripled in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 to more than 9 000. Last month, the route saw a large increase in the number of migrants seeking to cross the land borders of Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in northern Africa, as well as those attempting sea crossings.Western BalkansIn June, the Western Balkans route saw a low number of detections of illegal border-crossings, similar to the previous month.

The two-week-long operation was co-led by Hungary and carried out in the second half of June in Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Several countries deployed liaison officers to a coordination centre set up by Frontex in the police headquarters in Szeged, a city in southern Hungary near the Serbian border, to coordinate their activities. Europol and Interpol granted direct access to their databases, shared expertise on stolen vehicles and analysis of gathered intelligence. As a result, national police apprehended seven people smugglers, detected 546 irregular migrants and 667 people without valid travel documents. They also identified 24 stolen vehicles. In the course of this operation smuggled cigarettes, alcohol and drugs were detected along with illegal weapons and ammunition. The intelligence collected will help launch investigations of people suspected of involvement in migrant smuggling. Known as Joint Action Day (JAD) Danube II, the operation was coordinated by Frontex under the umbrella of the European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats (EMPACT). Danube II is one of many joint action days taking place this year, which collectively are called Operation Dragon 2017. They bring together Member States police forces, European agencies (Frontex and Europol), as well as Interpol, in the fight against organised crime.

The Executive Director of Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, called on the Member States to stand by their pledges to reinforce operation Triton.All participants recognised that Italy is facing extraordinary pressure and needs additional support from the EU and Frontex. The meeting focused on the topics raised during the informal JHA Council meeting in Tallinn last week, including support in returns of irregular migrants from Italy and the Code of Conduct for NGOs developed by the Italian authorities, in consultation with the European Commission.Furthermore, Italy has indicated that in case of massive influx of migrants, it would like to be able to disembark migrants in the ports of other Member States.It was agreed that a working group will be established without delay to further identify and elaborate what needs to be revised in the operational concept of Triton in view of decisions already reached at the political level, following the European Commission\u2019s Action plan presented at the informal JHA Council on 6 July.This working group will further assess the situation following today\u2019s meeting and will draft a new operational plan. At a later stage, participating Member States will be consulted.Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, and some participating Member States are willing to share their operational expertise to help develop the Code of Conduct for NGOs. When adopted, the working group will consider how it would impact Frontex operational activities.Frontex currently deploys nearly 400 officers and support staff to assist Italy to handle migratory pressure and combat cross-border crime as part of operation Triton. The operation also includes 12 vessels, three aircraft and four helicopters.Frontex is committed to reinforce its presence at hotspots in Italy to help the national authorities to speed up the process of identification and registration of migrants, as well as their referral to the asylum procedure. The agency will also intensify its role in combatting people smuggling networks.Frontex proposed to expand the use of the agency\u2019s unique multipurpose aerial surveillance (MAS) operation.

The core curriculum was updated to reflect the changing situation at EU\u2019s external borders, as well as new Frontex tasks introduced by the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation last year. For the first time, it also focuses on training related to coast guard functions.The document can be adapted to national laws, which in practice means that national authorities might choose additional training related to work at land, sea or air borders. It now also includes the principle of informal learning at work, which helps officers to gain a comprehensive understanding of their tasks.The updated curriculum is consistent with the principles of the European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning (EQF), which means that the related training will be recognised throughout the EU and will provide a reference point for educational standards for Frontex and member states.After the completion of a training based on this curriculum, border and coast guard officers are ready to be deployed and carry out their operational tasks at home and abroad, including taking part in Frontex operations.Training is one of the key tasks of Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Frontex has worked to harmonise border control in all EU member states, develop training curricula for border guards across the EU, identify needs and assist EU countries with training.The Common Core Curriculum was first established 15 years ago when the European Council decided that common standards for border guard education are needed at EU level. It has been implemented in all EU member states and in several Frontex partner countries (non-EU/non-Schengen countries).Its components include the history of border control, fundamental rights, national and EU legislation, border checks and border surveillance and combatting cross-border crime.

During the three-day Coastex2017 Coast Guard exercise hosted by the Portuguese presidency of the European Coast Guard Functions Forum, vessels, helicopters, airplanes and 90 observers from European Coast Guard authorities conducted exercises to test different coast guard functions. The scenarios tested were: detection of migrants, search and rescue, medical evacuation, pollution, illegal fishing, boarding of a ferry transporting a dangerous person, seizure of drugs and arrest of the traffickers.\u201cI am delighted to see vessels and helicopters from Italy, Spain and Portugal as well as coast guard officers coming from Germany and observers from 20 European maritime countries taking part in this exercise,\u201d said Berndt Koerner, Frontex Deputy Executive Director. \u00a0\u201cRunning exercises is crucial if we want to be effective at sea because it helps us test the best ways of working together in a variety of scenarios. The aim of this particular exercise, and the numerous seminars taking place behind the scenes, is to develop the best way of conducting coast guard operations together,\u201d he added.Coast Guard organisations differ from country to country in Europe. In some, the coast guard is mainly responsible for search and rescue, while other national authorities also cover responsibilities related to law enforcement, fisheries, maritime safety or pollution control.Frontex has been working hand in hand with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to cover the full scope of coast guard functions that go beyond border management. Vessels and aircraft deployed in Frontex operations are already collecting and sharing information to be used for fisheries control, detection of pollution and compliance with maritime regulations. The agency closely cooperates with law enforcement bodies of member states to combat serious cross-border crime at sea, including trafficking of human beings and terrorism.For more information on Coast guard functions, see:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBznMZChim8https://frontex.europa.eu/faq/key-factshttp://www.ecgff.eu/ ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/three-day-long-coast-guard-exercise-takes-place-in-troia-portugal-zydgfw"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0281", "date": "2017-06-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Frontex, EFCA and EMSA present results of pilot project \"Creation of a European coastguard function\"", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Frontex, EFCA and EMSA present results of pilot project \"Creation of a European coastguard function\" 2017-06-02 Today, the Closing Workshop of the pilot project \"Creation of a European coastguard function\" gathered some 110 participants from various European and national entities at the premises of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) in Lisbon. During the event Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, EFCA - the European Fisheries Control Agency and EMSA jointly presented the project results. The 18 months pilot project was launched in January 2016 in order to provide the test bed for the co-operation mechanism proposed by the Commission within the framework of the European border and coastguard package.\u201cWe are more effective when the agencies work together. The sharing of information, combined use of surveillance capabilities, multipurpose operations can better support the national authorities of the EU Member States when implementing coast guard functions\u201d \u2013 said Fabrice Leggeri, the Executive Director of Frontex.In the framework of the project the three Agencies explored ways to further develop their cooperation in four areas:sharing of information generated by fusing and analysing vessel movement and earth observation dataproviding surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technologycapacity buildingcapacity sharing including multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and capabilities across sectors and bordersThe enhanced cooperation among EMSA, EFCA and Frontex will enable them to better support the activities of over 300 civilian and military authorities in the EU Member States responsible for carrying out coastguard functions in a wide range of areas such as maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection.For more information on Coast Guard functions, see:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBznMZChim8https://frontex.europa.eu/faq/key-facts ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/frontex-efca-and-emsa-present-results-of-pilot-project-creation-of-a-european-coastguard-function--xvNGeM"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0282", "date": "2017-05-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Arrival of migrants in April: Italy higher than year ago, numbers in Greece drop", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Arrival of migrants in April: Italy higher than year ago, numbers in Greece drop 2017-05-16 There were more than 14 100 detections of illegal border crossings on the three main migratory routes into the EU in April, 2% higher than the number of detections from the previous month. The total number of detections in the first four months of 2017 fell 84% from the same period of last year to almost 47 000, even though Italy continued to see numbers higher than a year ago. Central Mediterranean In April, the number of migrants arriving in Italy through the Central Mediterranean route rose by 19% from March to 12 900. This brought the total for the first four months of the year to more than 37 200, 33% higher than the figure from the same period of 2016.Nationals from Nigeria, Bangladesh and Ivory Coast accounted for the largest number of the detected migrants. Since the beginning of 2017, the number of migrants from Bangladesh, Morocco and Pakistan has increased. A large number of them have been working in Libya for some time, but decided to leave in recent months because of the unstable situation there and limited employment possibilities. Eastern Mediterranean The number of migrants arriving on the Greek islands in the Aegean in April dropped by 46% from the previous month to 1 200. The figure was 68% lower than in April 2016, which was the first full month since the EU-Turkey statement came into effect, leading to a precipitous drop in arrivals.In April, the Turkish authorities prevented nearly 2 500 migrants from departing from Turkey (including cases where they responded to detections made by the Greek authorities). These figures are similar to those reported in March (2 600).In the first four months of this year, some 6 100 migrants reached the Greek islands, barely 4% of the number from the same period of 2016.Syrians and Iraqis accounted for the majority of detections on the Eastern Mediterranean route in April. Western Balkans There were fewer than 100 detections of illegal border-crossings in the Western Balkans in April. The reasons for the significantly lower number than in recent months is the fact that fewer migrants have been leaving Turkey through its land borders towards the Western Balkan route. Consequently, the migrants detected at EU\u2019s border in the region are mainly those who have been residing in Serbia and have now been crossing into Hungary, Croatia and Romania. Note:The data presented in this statement refer to the number of detections of illegal border-crossing at the external borders of the European Union. The same person may attempt to cross the border illegally several times in different locations at the external border.

Majority of the rescued people are believed to have come from Sub Saharan and North African countries, although their nationalities will only be known after the migrants are registered and screened in Italy. Women, some pregnant, and many children were among those rescued.Five vessels taking part in Frontex operation Triton were present in the area covering the flows from Libya and were diverted by the Italian Coast Guard to take part in the rescue operations. Frontex assists the Italian authorities with its border control operation Triton where it currently deploys 11 vessels (some of which belong to the Italian authorities but are financed by Frontex). The operation also includes three airplanes and three helicopters, as well as 334 border and coast guard officers. Their activities include border surveillance, search and rescue, identification and registration of migrants.\u201cThe crews of the vessels taking part in the Frontex operation in the Central Mediterranean continue to do their utmost to help the Italian authorities rescue people who were put on often unseaworthy boats well beyond any imaginable capacity by ruthless smugglers.

The report also presents observations and recommendations shared with Frontex and its Management Board on fundamental rights matters connected to the agency\u2019s activities.The development and implementation of the new European Border and Coast Guard Regulation was one of the primary objectives of the Consultative Forum\u2019s work in 2016. The Forum provided its views on the establishment of a Frontex individual complaint mechanism, a European pool of forced return monitors and discussed the potential limitations and implications of the extended mandate of Frontex in countries outside of the EU, among others.The report stresses the need for an accessible, impartial, transparent, independent and well-managed complaints mechanism to ensure that Frontex complies with its fundamental rights obligations and that an effective remedy is provided for refugees and migrants. The Consultative Forum calls for full compliance with fundamental rights, in particular the principle of non-refoulement and the right to an effective remedy when implementing Frontex enhanced mandate in return activities and cooperation with non-EU countries. Concerns on the situation at the Hungarian-Serbian border were also raised during 2016 with the Fundamental Rights Officer, Frontex and the Management Board.

Following the end of World War II, the Schuman Declaration began rebuilding Europe as a community, as well as a free trade and a free movement area for its citizens.The Declaration set the path for the creation of\u00a0the Schengen Area in 1995, the largest free travel area in the world, allowing European citizens to cross the national borders of European member states unhindered. This decision lead to the creation of a common external EU border and required cooperation between national border authorities to protect the common free movement area.Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, was the response to this need. The agency has been set up to assist member states in managing their external borders and tackling common security threats such as cross-border crime and terrorism.Frontex currently deploys 27 vessels, 5 helicopters and 5 aircraft as well as more than 1 300 border and coast guard officers at EU\u2019s external borders.

The report also presents a picture of the smuggling networks in Africa.The city of Agadez in Niger remained the key transit hub for migratory movements towards Libya with many networks facilitating onward movements operating there. The networks are based on a hierarchical structure with the so-called ghetto boss at the top. He owns one or more compounds where migrants are lodged, as well as a number of vehicles (either stolen or purchased) \u2013 typically pickups and military-style cargo trucks from Libya.

Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri and EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos Under Commissioner Avramopoulos\u2019 mandate, the European Commission tabled in December 2015 a new regulation to give Frontex a broader mandate in order to tackle the increasing challenges at the EU\u2019s external borders. After only six months of political negotiations, the Council and the European Parliament adopted new tasks and competences for Frontex in the framework of the European Border and Coast Guard, entrusting the Agency with a broader responsibility in the management of the external borders of the EU. Earlier this month, the Agency signed a new headquarters agreement with the Polish government, defining the legal status for the Agency and its employees in Poland. \u201cCommissioner Avramopoulos was one of the architects of the European Border and Coast Guard and his first visit to our premises highlights his support for the expansion of our role in migration management and border security over the coming months and years,\u201d said the Agency\u2019s Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. Commissioner Avramopoulos met with the Agency\u2019s management and staff and visited the Frontex Situation Centre (FSC), which provides an up-to-date picture of what is going on at Europe\u2019s external borders and the migratory situation. FSC acts as a central point of contact and information access for all of the Agency\u2019s stakeholders and is a vital part of a rapid-response mechanism in the event of an emergency situation anywhere at the external borders. The Commissioner also saw live streaming video from a plane taking part in a new multi-purpose operation in cooperation with the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) \u2013 a significant step towards expanding Frontex\u2019s role in promoting European coast guard functions. Under its expanded mandate, the Agency has created a rapid reaction pool to quickly react to emergencies at EU\u2019s external borders. It also has gained new competences in return activities and is developing vulnerability assessments of all member states at their borders. With the expansion of its role and activities, the Agency plans to increase its staffing from the current level of about 400 to 600 by the end of this year and 1000 in 2020.

The conference, hosted by the Portuguese Immigration and Borders Service, gathered more than 140 participants representing all major European and non-European airport authorities responsible for border control. The main topics discussed during the conference included threats to airport border security, methods to detect forged and fraudulent travel documents, foreign terrorist fighters and trafficking in human beings. Specific areas such as Schengen evaluation and monitoring activities, risk analysis forecasts, and cooperation with non-European partners and international organisations were also featured during the meeting.\u00a0 \u201cBorder guards working at airports face entirely different challenges than those working at maritime or land border. This is clear when you realise that only last year more than 400 million passengers entered the European Union via its international airports,\u201d said Koerner. The obvious challenge for border guards working at airports is to ensure that legitimate travellers pass through quickly, while any kind of illegal activity is detected in a timely manner. \u201cOn average, a border guard working at an airport has only a few seconds to decide whether a passport or a visa presented by the traveller is not forged, whether the baby sleeping in a pram is not a victim of trafficking or whether the person attempting to cross our external border is not on a wanted list. \u00a0This understandably requires border guards to have a remarkable level of training and skill as European safety is very much in their hands,\u201d \u2013 he added. Sharing of knowledge between authorities not only within Europe, but also with non-European partners is therefore crucial. The annual event serves as a platform for exchange of information between airport authorities on latest tactics of criminal networks and effective ways to fight cross-border crime.\u00a0 Conference participants included European airport authorities, as well guests from countries outside of the EU, such as Albania, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Cape Verde, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Georgia, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine and the US.

This technology is complementary\u00a0to a manual border control process and is based on the use of electronic travel document and biometrics to verify the authenticity of the document and passenger\u2019s identity in an automated way, that is to verify if a traveller is the one whom he/she claims to be. ABC systems are already extensively used at airports in 16 EU member states and are expanding to other type of borders. During the two-week course that takes place in Lisbon, 56 officers from 27 EU Member States \u00a0and selected experts from Frontex and eu-Lisa will be given a comprehensive training in this important area of border control.\u00a0 \u00a0The first line officers (border guards responsible for passport control) will focus on the principles of ABC systems, operation of automatic gates, role of biometrics in identity verification systems and possible vulnerabilities. During the advanced-level training experts will focus on assessment, testing and mitigation of security risks in ABC systems. The training courses include different elements such as trainer\u2019s manuals, face-to-face training with a practical component and an on-line self-directed training tool to be used at the national level. This is the first harmonised training on ABC systems ever developed. It was put together by Frontex in cooperation with Portuguese Immigration and Borders Service (SEF), the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and many national and international experts.Over the years, automated border control has proven to be an efficient and reliable part of the border control process. \u00a0As the volume of passengers crossing international borders increases, the role of ABC continues to grow. This is why border guards responsible for border checks at airports need to have a clear understanding of the complex landscape of ABC procedures and functionalities, as well as the associated risks and vulnerabilities. Frontex became involved in the field of automated border control in 2007. Since 2010, it has facilitated the ABC Working Group composed of experts from EU Member States and non-European countries to harmonise efforts and identify best practices. Frontex has also been organising ABC Workshops and Global ABC conferences to promote international cooperation in this field.

Frontex estimates that this figure corresponds to about 382\u00a0000 migrants coming to Europe from the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Compared to the 1.8 million illegal border-crossings reported in 2015, 2016 saw a significant decrease, but this figure is still higher than any annual figure for arrivals between 2010 (104\u00a0060) and 2014 (282\u00a0933). Most migrants arrived in Italy and Greece, with each country reporting roughly 180\u00a0000 new arrivals. While arrivals in the Central Mediterranean steadily grew throughout the year, in Greece more than 80% migrants arrived between January and March. The subsequent drop in arrivals was a consequence of both the EU-Turkey statement that came into effect on 18 March, which permitted the readmission of migrants to Turkey, and the closure of the Western Balkan route due to stricter management of the FYROM border. While migration pressure at the Greek\u2013Turkish border significantly decreased following the EU-Turkey statement, Italy registered a 17% increase in 2016 in comparison with the previous year. Consequently, arrivals via the Central Mediterranean route exceeded 150\u00a0000 for the third year in a row. Similar to previous years, irregular migration via Libya was almost entirely dependent on people smuggling networks. Most migrants heading for Italy departed from Libya aboard overcrowded and unseaworthy rubber dinghies and were subsequently rescued by coast guard, Frontex, military, commercial or NGO vessels close to the Libyan shore. Tragically, despite around-the-clock rescue efforts, thousands of migrants lost their lives at sea while attempting to cross to Europe. Last year, a record number of arrivals was also reported on the Western Mediterranean route, where 10\u00a0000 migrants were detected. Most migrants on this route came from Sub-Saharan and North African countries. For the fourth consecutive year in 2016, persons claiming to be Syrian nationals represented the highest share of migrants illegally entering the EU (17% of total EU). As in 2015, most Syrians used the Eastern Mediterranean route but their numbers decreased by more than 80%, with 84\u00a0500 detections in 2016. Coinciding with the increase in the Central and Western Mediterranean, the detection of African migrants reached a record high of more than 170\u00a0000, compared with an average of about 40\u00a0000 between 2009 and 2013. This surge reveals a steady increase in irregular migration from the African continent, and in particular from West Africa. The number of returns of non-EU citizens to their country of origin reached 176 000, roughly in line with 2015. The reason for this was mainly linked to the difficulties faced by national authorities in obtaining travel documents for the returnees. In 2016, Frontex coordinated the return of 10 700 non-EU nationals on 232 return flights. This is a significant rise from the previous year, when 3 565 non-EU nationals were returned on 66 joint return flights. The Frontex report concludes that close cooperation between border guards, police and customs officials is essential to ensure border security and to tackling a range of criminal activities at Europe\u2019s external borders. As the geopolitical situation around Europe remains volatile, border control measures will require a combination of rapid and efficient coast guard actions, cooperation with countries of transit and origin of migrants and the more effective returns of migrants who do not have a right to remain in the EU.

The heads of border guard and asylum services of 28 Member States plus representatives from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland discussed cooperation between the agencies as a crucial element in implementing the European Union\u2019s policies on migration management. The main issues of the joint session included cooperation between EU agencies in hotspots in Greece and Italy, as well as the exchange of data and analysis on migration to the EU. The participants also discussed future cooperation in light of proposals by the European Commission to substantially increase the role and responsibilities of the two agencies and to revise the European asylum acquis and EU legislation governing border security and migration management.\u00a0 The Executive Directors of both Agencies also signed the EASO-Frontex Cooperation Plan for 2017-2018. It foresees concrete initiatives in the fields of joint operations, information exchange and training, as well as discussions on more harmonised procedures and administrative practices. The Cooperation Plan complements the existing Bilateral Working Arrangement signed in 2012. The meeting was addressed by Director General Ruete of DG Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship and Maltese Minister Carmelo Abela, representing the Maltese Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The Chair of the EASO Management Board, Wolfgang Taucher called the joint session \u2018an important meeting which represents just the start of increased cooperation between the agencies.\u201d Frontex Chair, Marko Gasperlin said that \u201cthis meeting shows how closely both agencies work on border and migration management issues in these challenging times.\u201d For the past year and a half, both agencies have been assisting the Italian and Greek authorities in the hotspots and worked together to provide a full situational picture about migratory flows on two main routes into the European Union in order to help the authorities be better prepared to manage them.

More than 8 200 migrants reached Italy by sea in December, indicating a drop of nearly 40% from the previous month due in large part to wintry weather conditions in the Central Mediterranean. Because of a spike in arrivals over the previous two months, the total number of migrants taking the sea route to Italy in 2016 reached an all-time high of 181 100. Nationals from Nigeria, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Guinea accounted for the largest number of arrivals in Italy last month. Meanwhile, the number of migrants reaching the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean fell to slightly fewer than 1 600 in December, nearly 28% lower than in November. This was less than 2% of the number of migrants arriving on the Greek islands in December 2015. In all of last year, 175 000 migrants reached Greece by sea, although just one in 10 migrants who reached the islands did so after March. The migration pressure on Greece eased significantly following the implementation of the EU/Turkey statement in late March. In December, Syrians, Algerians and Afghans made up the largest portion of the migrants on this route. The number of detections of illegal border-crossings in the Western Balkans last month stood at nearly 1 170, less than 1% of the figure from the same month a year ago.

Frontex and its partners support the target countries in developing a protection-sensitive response to mixed migration flows by strengthening their identification, registration, referral, asylum systems and return mechanisms, in line with EU policies. In the course of the project's first year, Frontex organised six regional trainings in combatting trafficking in human beings, detection of falsified documents, identification and screening of nationality, as well as courses in interviewing techniques. The training activities were supported by experts from Member States.Frontex organised the courses for border authorities who will train their national services in the future.

Last year saw a significant drop in arrivals on the Greek islands, while Italy experienced a record number of migrants. According to preliminary estimates, last year the number of migrants detected on Greece\u2019s islands in the eastern Aegean and its mainland dropped by 79% to 182 500. This was in large part due to the EU/Turkey statement, which came into effect in late March and led to tighter border control by the Turkish authorities and readmission of migrants from the Greek islands to Turkey. The drop was also influenced by tighter border controls in the Western Balkans. Since March, the monthly numbers of arrivals on the Greek islands accounted for just a fraction of the previous year\u2019s figures and ranged between 4 400 and 1 800. Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis accounted for the largest share of the arriving migrants. Coinciding with a decreasing flow on the Eastern Mediterranean route, the number of migrants across the Western Balkans in 2016 fell sharply to 123 000 from 764 000 in 2015. Last year\u2019s drop was also affected by a range of measures implemented by the EU and Western Balkan countries. Meanwhile, the number of detections on the Central Mediterranean route rose by nearly one-fifth to 181 000, the highest number ever recorded. This reflects a steadily increasing migratory pressure from the African continent, particularly West Africa, which accounted for most of the growth in 2016. Since 2010, Italy has seen a tenfold increase in detections of West Africans at its sea borders. Nigerians made up the largest portion of the migrants on this route, followed by nationals from Eritrea, Guinea, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Gambia.

They were conducted in close cooperation with EU Member States, Europol and Interpol. The actions focus on particular targets and threats at selected airports, harbours and main routes across land borders, as well as criminal groups and their specific methods.In Action\u00a0Danube, which was co-led with Hungary, participating organisations worked together to tackle people smuggling, gather intelligence on people smuggling networks and cross-check national and international databases. The operation included national police officers focusing on criminal issues, Frontex guest officers, as well as Interpol and Europol.

The exercise, which simulated an operation involving the rescue of irregular migrants at an external maritime border was testing operational coordination between maritime border police and the Croatian Navy and Coast Guard.The European Border and Coast Guard Agency was officially launched last week. It has been built on the foundations of Frontex, which has been coordinating operations at the external EU borers for more than a decade.

Building on the foundations of Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency will closely monitor the EU's external borders and work together with Member States to quickly identify and address any potential security threats to the EU's external borders. Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said: \"Today is a milestone in the history of European border management. From now onwards, the external EU border of one Member State is the external border of all Member States \u2013 both legally and operationally. In less than one year we have established a fully-fledged European Border and Coast Guard system, turning into reality the principles of shared responsibility and solidarity among the Member States and the Union. This is exactly the European response that we need for the security and migration challenges of the 21st century.\"Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, holder of the rotating Presidency of the Council, said: \"By launching the European Border and Coast Guard, we are creating a new reality at our external borders. This is a tangible outcome of the joint commitment agreed in the Bratislava Roadmap, as well as a practical display of unity among Member States. It will help us to get back to Schengen. The Presidency is determined to help further strengthen the European Border and Coast Guard, as well as translate other commitments from the Roadmap into action.\" Executive Director of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, Fabrice Leggeri, said: \u201cThis is a historic moment and I am very proud to see Frontex become the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The new Agency is stronger and better equipped to tackle migration and security challenges at Europe\u2019s external borders. Its mandate has wider scope and new powers that will allow it to act effectively. The Agency will conduct stress tests at the external borders to identify vulnerabilities before a crisis hits. It will now also be able to offer operational support to neighbouring non-EU countries who ask for assistance at their border and share intelligence on cross-border criminal activities with national authorities and European agencies in support of criminal investigations.\u00a0 It also has a key role at Europe\u2019s maritime borders through its new coast guard functions.\u201d Under the new mandate, the Agency's role and activities have been significantly expanded. The Agency\u2019s permanent staff will be more than doubled and the Agency will be able to purchase its own equipment and deploy them in border operations at short notice. A rapid reserve pool of at least 1,500 border guards and a technical equipment pool will be put at the disposal of the Agency \u2013 meaning there will no longer be shortages of staff or equipment for Agency operations. The European Border and Coast Guard will now ensure the implementation of Union standards of border management through periodic risk analysis and mandatory vulnerability assessments.\u00a0 The European Border and Coast Guard will provide a missing link in strengthening Europe's external borders, so that people can continue to live and move freely within the European Union \u2013 helping to meet Europe's commitment to get back to the normal functioning of the Schengen area and the lifting of temporary internal border controls by the end of the year, as set out in the Commission's Back to Schengen Roadmap on 4 March.Over the next months, the new Agency will be fully rolled out:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 OCTOBER 2016: new Agency is legally operational\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7 DECEMBER 2016: rapid reaction pool and the rapid reaction equipment pool become operational\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BY DECEMBER 2016: 50 new recruitments in the Agency\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7 JANUARY 2017: return pools become operational\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 JANUARY-MARCH 2017: first vulnerability assessments.BackgroundThe establishment of a European Border and Coast Guard, as announced by President Juncker in his State of the Union Speech on 9 September 2015, is part of the measures set out under the European Agenda on Migration to reinforce the management and security of the EU's external borders. The Schengen area without internal borders is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively secured and protected.On 15 December 2015, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal for the creation of a European Border and Coast Guard, building on existing structures of Frontex, to meet the new challenges and political realities faced by the EU, both as regards migration and internal security. The European Border and Coast Guard was approved by the European Parliament and Council in a record time of just nine months. The European Border and Coast Guard will help to manage migration more effectively, improve the internal security of the European Union and safeguard the principle of free movement of persons. The establishment of a European Border and Coast Guard will ensure a strong management of the EU\u2019s external borders as a shared responsibility between the Union and its Member States.

It is based on the idea of Integrated Border Management, which relies on coordination and cooperation among all the relevant authorities and agencies involved in border security and trade facilitation to establish effective and coordinated border management. The six Eastern Partnership countries are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The project addresses national agencies involved in border management, such as border police and customs. Those ultimately benefiting from improved border management include not only travellers and commercial operators crossing borders, but also people in need of special protection such as asylum seekers, potential victims of human trafficking, and unaccompanied minors. Frontex provides training support based on the specific needs of each participating country. The creation of a modern training system according to EU best practices; improved process of border crossing for passengers, traders and freight; raising awareness and support to the fight against corruption and safeguarding the fundamental rights of persons crossing the borders are among the main goals of the project. The project is implemented in cooperation with three partner organisations: The World Customs Organization (WCO), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the International Centre for Migration Policy and Development (ICMPD). It will run until 2017 and has a budget of EUR 4.5 mln.

The EU Return Directive requires Member States to provide for an effective forced-return monitoring system. However, it does not oblige them to have a monitor on each return flight. \u201cI would like to invite monitors from various EU Member States to be on board of joint return operations coordinated by Frontex,\u201d said Frontex Deputy Executive Director Berndt Koerner during his opening speech. The role of Frontex in the coordination of return operations is expected to increase with the entry into force of the new European Border and Coast Guard regulation. \u201cThe current proposal for the new European Border and Coast Guard regulation provides for the setting up of a pool of independent monitors to ensure that all Frontex-coordinated return operations are effectively monitored,\u201d added Koerner. The participants of the two-day workshop included a representative of the European Ombudsman, delegates of the Frontex Consultative Forum on Fundamental Rights, the Council of Europe\u2019s Committee for the Prevention of Torture, the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD), national monitors from organisations and institutions involved in monitoring of returns, as well as monitors from partner third countries. Background: Most EU countries organise return flights individually, however Frontex can provide support with the logistical side of the returns including acquisition of travel documents and co-financing of the flight. The decision about who should be returned remains the exclusive responsibility of the authorities of the individual Member States taken in regard to each person. During joint return flights coordinated by Frontex, returnees are always accompanied by escort officers from the EU member state which returns the persons to their countries of origin. Since the beginning of this year Frontex has coordinated 70 joint return operations \u2013 double the amount from last year. It is expected that the number will reach 140 by the end of the year. \u00a0 For more information about the role of Frontex in return operations see:\u00a0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6NO3b6liTs http://frontex.europa.eu/pressroom/hot-topics/the-role-of-frontex-in-return-operations-zOL89l \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/frontex-organises-workshop-for-monitors-of-joint-return-operations-2s0swb"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0349", "date": "2016-05-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "5th Meeting of Contact Group of European Coastguard Functions hosted in Warsaw", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus 5th Meeting of Contact Group of European Coastguard Functions hosted in Warsaw 2016-05-26 The heads of Frontex, the\u00a0European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA)\u00a0and the\u00a0European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA)\u00a0and representative of the European Commission met in Warsaw on 25 May to discuss multipurpose maritime operations and co-operation in the area of maritime surveillance, information sharing and capacity building.

To allow the agencies to test its concept in a real operational setting, Frontex adjusted the operational plan of its operation Triton in Italy to allow cooperation between EMSA and EFCA. This permitted a deployment of an EFCA inspector on board a vessel and patrol plane deployed in Triton. Similar activities are to be implemented this year in other Frontex maritime operations.

Another reason for the monthly increase was a growing number of departures from Egypt.

In May, around 1 500 migrants were detected arriving by sea in the Eastern Mediterranean, corresponding to a 60% drop from the previous month.The fall is a result of several factors, including The EU-Turkey statement and stricter border policies applied by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at its border with Greece.

The number of detections was more than six times the previous record set in 2014. A large number of illegal crossings were made by people who were counted for the first time when arriving on the Greek islands from Turkey and later were counted again when crossing one of EU\u2019s external borders in the Western Balkans. The Eastern Mediterranean route, especially the Greek islands in the Aegean, accounted for the largest number of detections \u2013 nearly 885 400. More than 90% of the detections, or 803 000, were reported in the second half of the year. Syrian nationals accounted for the largest proportion of arrivals, although the share of Afghans rose significantly towards the end of the year. Iraqis were the third largest nationality using this route. Some 764 000 detections were recorded on the Western Balkan route, mainly on Hungary\u2019s and Croatia\u2019s border with Serbia. In 2015, the number of migrants arriving via the Central Mediterranean route fell by about a tenth to 154 000, in large part due to the fact that Syrians had switched to using the Eastern Mediterranean route. However, the number of East and West Africans steadily increased by 42% to more than 108 000. The most often reported nationality was Eritrean, although by regions, the majority of the migrants came from West Africa. The share of rubber boats used on this route increased last year. The use of weak, overcrowded boats with limited fuel supplies by smugglers seeking to maximise their profits put migrant lives at risk, leading to search and rescue operations saving an unprecedented number of people. Frontex saved some 40% of the people rescued in the Central Mediterranean region and 90% of those near the Greek islands in the Aegean. The record number of migrants seeking to make their way to Europe also led to an increase in the number of detections of people smugglers, which rose by a fifth to more than 12 000. Moroccans, Spaniards, Albanians and Syrians were the most represented nationalities among the people smugglers. On several occasions, especially on the Central Mediterranean route, smugglers threatened border guards and rescue teams to recover the boats used to transport migrants. The number of asylum applications in 2015 rose to an unprecedented level of 1.35 million, according to EASO. However, the number of return decisions issued by the Member States (286 700) and the number of effective returns (175 200) remained relatively stable when compared to the previous year. Albanians accounted for 17% of all effective returns, trailed by Ukrainians (8.6%) and residents of Kosovo* (5.8%). The Annual Risk Analysis for 2016 also describes a series of alternative futures developed in collaboration with experts from relevant stakeholder organisations. These scenarios may be used as a foresight instrument at a strategic level. The Annual Risk Analysis also points out three major challenges to be faced at the external borders: an unprecedented rise in migratory pressure, an increasing terrorist threat and a steady rise in the number of regular travellers. *This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.

The total number of migrants detected crossing the EU\u2019s external borders in the Eastern Mediterranean for the entire month of March reached 26 460, less than half the figure recorded in February. In line with the EU/Turkey agreement decided by the European Council on 17/18 March, Greece said it would return to Turkey most of the migrants arriving on its islands after March 20. Some 3 500 migrants arrived in Greece in the last 11 days of March. This compares to 22 900 people who were detected illegally crossing the borders on the Greek islands and the rest of the Eastern Mediterranean route between March 1 and March 20. Nevertheless, the number of detections in March 2016 was three times the number from a year ago. \u201cEven though weather conditions continue to play a part in the number of arrivals on the islands in the Aegean, the recent downward trend has continued into April. There have been fewer than 100 arrivals per day on average in the first half of this month,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s early days yet, but initial indications are that thanks to the array of recent initiatives taken by the Commission, Greece, Turkey and the EU agencies, we have been able to improve control over our external borders and are beginning to manage the migratory flows better, in a more rational and fair manner,\u201d Leggeri added. In April, Frontex assisted Greece in transporting 325 migrants to Turkey. Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis continued to make up for the largest share of the migrants coming to the Greek islands. Western Balkans After the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia significantly reduced the number of migrants it allowed to enter from Greece, the number of detections of illegal border crossings in March at EU\u2019s external borders in the Western Balkans dropped by about 90% compared to the previous month. The March figure of 4 930 was also nearly 10% lower compared to the same month of 2015. Central Mediterranean Meanwhile, improved weather in the central Mediterranean region led to more than doubling of the number of migrants crossing the sea to Italy, when compared to February. The monthly total in March reached nearly 9 600, compared to 2 283 in the same month of 2015. Nearly all detections on this route were of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, mainly nationals of Nigeria, Somalia and Gambia. There have been no signs of a significant shift of migrants from other routes, especially the Eastern Mediterranean, to the Central Mediterranean.

In previous years, the adverse weather and rough sea conditions slowed down migration across the Mediterranean Sea at the onset of autumn. In 2015, however, migrants continued to arrive in record numbers in Greece in the final months of the year. In the fourth quarter of last year there were nearly 484\u00a0000 detections on the Eastern Mediterranean route, mainly on the islands in the Aegean. Among the migrants, 46% claimed to be Syrian and 28% said they were from Afghanistan. The flow of migrants had a direct knock-on effect on the Western Balkan route, where people who had arrived in Greece were recorded for the second time re-entering the EU. In the October-December period, there were 466\u00a0800 detections of illegal border-crossings associated with the migratory flow from Serbia to Croatia. Illegal border-crossings at the external borders may be attempted several times by the same person. This means that a large number of the people who were counted when they arrived in Greece were again reported when entering the EU for the second time through Hungary or Croatia. Meanwhile, the number of detections of illegal border-crossing in the Central Mediterranean fell by a third. The percentage of African migrants on this route increased, with Syrian nationals, who had taken this route in the past, now tending to go to Greece instead. Overshadowed by the unprecedented migration flows in Greece was the fact that the level of irregular migration in the Western Mediterranean doubled in the fourth quarter compared to a year before. The number of illegal border-crossings in the area reached nearly 2\u00a0800, more than in any other fourth quarter in the past.

This regional support programme for the countries of the Western Balkans and Turkey aims to establish a harmonized, effective and protection-sensitive migration management in line with EU standards. Last year, over 1 million migrants and refugees entered the EU mainly via Greece but also via Italy. Countries of Western Balkans were heavily affected by the movements of hundreds of thousands of people coming via Turkey. \u201cThe migratory pressure on the countries of the Western Balkans has clearly demonstrated the need to strengthen border management capacities in this region. We need to build resilience of the national authorities to cope better with this type of situations in the future, but also to reinforce their bid to joining the EU and Schengen,\u201d said Frontex Deputy Executive Director Berndt K\u00f6rner. The programme\u2019s focus is to build the capacity of the countries in the Western Balkans and Turkey and help them improve border management systems in line with EU standards. Since the programme includes so many different elements, Frontex, the European Asylum Support Office, International Organisation for Migration and UNHCR will all be involved in its implementation. \u201cThe humanitarian situation of the migrants along the Western Balkans route calls for urgent action using all available EU and national means to alleviate it. The current contingency planning provides a significant funding to support countries facing large numbers of refugees and migrants. The programme launched today is complementary and provides sustainable solutions for the future,\u201d said K\u00f6rner. Effective border management includes sound border checks and surveillance capacity, identification and registration of migrants, identification of vulnerable groups and people seeking international protection, as well as well functioning asylum procedures. \u201cLast but not least, effective border management requires a system to return those who are not eligible for asylum back to their home countries,\u201d said K\u00f6rner.

Frontex has already been closely cooperating with Europol and EU Member States in their efforts against serious cross-border crime. The agency took an active part in last year\u2019s Operation Blue Amber, a series of coordinated international actions called Joint Action Days, aimed at tackling organised crime groups. Frontex provided the support for dismantling the criminal networks behind facilitated irregular migration, trafficking in human beings and other forms of cross border crime such as illicit firearms trafficking or stolen vehicles smuggling. Operation Blue Amber led to nearly 900 arrests and a seizure of more than 250 stolen vehicles, 7.7 tonnes of drugs. In 2016, Frontex will for the first time organise two Joint Action Days, one at an EU external land border in the Western Balkans and another at external air borders. The agency will cooperate with EU Member States, Europol and Interpol. It will also establish a special coordination centre to improve the flow of intelligence between the participants aligned with Europol coordination centre. \u201cIt is essential for Frontex to work closely with Europol and other international partners in fighting cross-border crime, even as we deploy record numbers of officers to frontline Member States to help them with the unprecedented number of migrants,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. \u201cThese two challenges are linked closely together. Smugglers and people traffickers are making billions from the desperate migrants and a large chunk of this money goes to fund other illegal activities, such as drug and weapon smuggling,\u201d Leggeri added. Joint Action Days are organised under the umbrella of EU policy cycle/EMPACT (European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats) in close cooperation with Europol. They focus on particular targets and threats at selected airports, ports, land borders, main routes, criminal groups or their specific methods. Last year, Frontex supported five Joint Action Days organised within the Blue Amber Operation. Among them there were two Global Airline Action Days concentrating on credit card and ID fraud in addition to trafficking in human beings and facilitated irregular migration.

This is nearly five times the figure from the previous year. In December, 108 000 migrants were detected in Greece, down from 155 000 the previous month, but still 40 times the figure from December 2014.

Syrians remained the top nationality.Central MediterraneanMeanwhile, the number of migrants using the Central Mediterranean route to Italy in December rose by 50% to nearly 9 700. This was caused by good weather conditions despite the onset of winter and continued flows of migrants to Libya. This brought the total for the year to 157 000, which was 8% lower than the record set in 2014. The main reasons for the year-on-year drop was the shift of Syrian migrants to the Eastern Mediterranean route (Greece) and, in recent months, a shortage of boats available to people smugglers. Last month, Nigerian nationals accounted for the biggest share of migrants arriving in Italy.Western BalkansThe Western Balkan route continued to be directly affected by the unprecedented number of migrants who first come to Greece to later continue their journey through its northern border. The number of illegal border crossings in December 2015 fell to 97 000 from 156 000 the previous month, but was still 16 times higher than in December 2014.

However, this was still the highest number of arrivals in Greece in the month of November.The worsening weather conditions, which make it more dangerous for migrants to cross the sea from Turkey to the Greek islands, are likely the main reason for the significant decrease in the number of migrants.

In the January-November period, the number of detections at the external borders in the region reached nearly 667 000, a 22-fold rise when compared to first 11 months of the previous year.Most of the migrants detected in the Western Balkans on the Hungarian and Croatian borders with Serbia had previously arrived on one of the Greek islands. They then left Greece and the EU through the country\u2019s northern land border with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and continued through Serbia to re-enter the EU in Hungary or Croatia.Including the crossings in the Western Balkans, the total number of detections of illegal border crossings at the EU external borders stood at 276 000 in November compared to 283 000 in all of 2014. The total number of detections of illegal border crossings in the first 11 months of 2015 reached 1.55 million. Frontex provides monthly data on the number of people detected at the external borders of the European Union. Irregular border crossings may be attempted by the same person several times in different locations at the external border. This means that a large number of the people who were counted when they arrived in Greece were again counted when entering the EU for the second time through Hungary or Croatia.

Following a required evaluation, Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri decided to activate the RABIT mechanism.Greece and Frontex now have five working days to agree on an operational plan to be signed by the Frontex Executive Director. The RABIT deployment requires Greece to provide a number of national officers and team leaders who will work alongside officers deployed by Frontex. \u201cThe RABIT deployment will allow us to increase the number of both sea and land patrols, which means more migrants will be identified and properly registered soon after they arrive on the Greek islands. In other words, launching RABIT means upscaling Operation Poseidon Sea,\u201d said Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.Out of more than 700 000 migrants who reached the Greek islands from Turkey so far this year, only one in five was intercepted upon reaching the shore.The RABIT deployment will increase the number of officers and technical equipment, such as boats and patrol cars, deployed on the Greek islands. The operation shall also have a new focus on security checks. Officers who will conduct security checks by consulting national and pan-European databases are to work alongside screening, debriefing and fingerprinting experts. The RABIT deployment will replace currently running operation Poseidon Sea and will cover similar operational area. Currently, in the Aegean islands, Frontex deploys 16 vessels and more than 260 officers assisting in the registration of new arrivals, as well as border surveillance officers, and debriefing and document experts.The 448 officers offered so far by Member States in response to the Frontex\u2019s most recent request call for 775 border guards in October will now take part in the RABIT deployment. Unlike participation in regular Frontex operations, it is mandatory for member states to provide officers and equipment for RABIT deployments. So far, the RABIT mechanism had been activated only once, in October 2010, also by Greece. The operation at the Greek-Turkish land border in the Evros region started in November 2010 and ended in March 2011, when Frontex resumed Joint Operation Poseidon Land.

Fusion Services use optical and radar satellite technology to locate vessels requiring search and rescue operations or those that are suspected of being engaged in criminal activities, such as drug or weapon smuggling. Many of the services are delivered in cooperation with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the EU Satellite Centre (SatCen).The Copernicus services address six thematic areas: land, marine, atmosphere, climate change, emergency management and security.

The remaining 53 percent of the detections involved nationals from outside the region, especially citizens of Vietnam and Afghanistan. Detections of illegal crossings between border crossing points in the April-June period increased 82 percent from the previous quarter and 74 percent from the same three-month period of 2014.

However, a large number of the persons detected at the Hungarian border with Serbia had already been counted when they arrived in Greece from Turkey a few weeks earlier.By comparison, in the entire 2014, there were 280 000 detections at EU borders.The Greek islands again saw the biggest number of detections in August at 88 000, an 11-fold rise compared to the same month last year. Nearly three-quarters of the people arriving from Turkey were Syrians.\u201cThe Greek islands continue to be under an intense migratory pressure. Just last week Frontex offered additional staff to help identify and register the new arrivals on Lesbos and Kos, which have been particularly affected,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.The migrants arriving from Turkey speak about increasingly aggressive and cruel smugglers, who ignore worsening weather conditions and force migrants on overcrowded rubber boats to squeeze a bigger profit out of every trip. A large number of the migrants arriving in Greece make their way towards Hungary, where the number of detections at its border with Serbia increased 20-fold to more than 52 000 in August, bringing the number so far this year to more than 155 000.Italy detected nearly 13 000 migrants in the month of August, nearly half the number from the same month of last year. These were mainly people from Eritrea and a number of Sub-Saharan countries who arrived from Libya, although an increasing number of them departed Turkey. Since the beginning of the year, 106 000 migrants were rescued in the Central Mediterranean, 6 percent fewer than in the same period of last year.

Syrians ranked just ahead of Afghans, whose number nearly tripled to 18 850.The record number of Syrians and Afghans detected at the Western Balkan borders is closely linked to the massive inflow of migrants arriving on the Greek islands from Turkey. The high pressure on the Aegean Islands is later echoed on the Western Balkan route with a certain time lag, which corresponds to the time migrants need to organise their onwards movements.In the April-June period, the number of detections involving African migrants more than tripled compared to the previous quarter, reaching 4 000. All regions of Africa contributed to this overall increase, with Congolese, Somalis, Cameroonians and Nigerians being the top reported nationalities.Meanwhile, the number of detections of citizens of Western Balkan countries dropped by 83 percent quarter-on-quarter, mainly because of the near disappearance of Kosovo nationals at the Hungarian border with Serbia. The drop in the numbers of Kosovo nationals resulted from a concerted measures undertaken by Kosovo, Serbia, Hungary, Austria and Germany. More than 2 200 migrants were detected seeking to pass the Western Balkans border crossing points hidden in vehicles \u2013 a six-fold rise from the previous quarter and the highest number since data collection began.

These are just a\u00a0few\u00a0questions answered in\u00a0VEGA Handbook: Children at airports, which was\u00a0published this week by Frontex.The handbook is the result of years of cooperation between Frontex, border guards,\u00a0non-governmental\u00a0agencies and\u00a0international organisations\u00a0such as\u00a0United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\u00a0(UNHCR) and\u00a0International Organization for Migration\u00a0(IOM)\u00a0to create\u00a0a set of\u00a0guidelines for border\u00a0guards\u00a0to help assist children at risk.For most victims of human trafficking, the moment of passing through an airport may be the only time they will come in contact with law enforcement officials before they disappear into the world of exploitation.\u201cFor a border guard who has only a few seconds to spot a potential problem at an airport, detecting children who may be victims of trafficking is difficult, to\u00a0say the least.

Even though Italy continues to deal with a massive number of arriving migrants, in recent months the route through Greece has taken over as the path into the EU most affected by migration flows. In the first seven months of 2015, nearly 130 500 migrants have been detected at Greece\u2019s external borders, a five-fold increase from the same period of last year. In the entire 2014, the figure in the Eastern Mediterranean stood at 41 700. Syrians and Afghans accounted for nine out of every ten migrants detected at the Greek borders this year. There was also a significant increase in the number of Pakistani citizens. The migrants, using small rubber and fibre glass boats, arrive from Turkey on four Greek islands: Lesbos, Chios, Kos and Samos. Frontex is coordinating Joint Operation Poseidon Sea 2015 to assist the Greek authorities in conducting border surveillance along its sea borders. \u201cThe fact that last month more migrants crossed the Greek borders than in the entire 2014 only underscores the need for Frontex to assist Greece in dealing with this crisis. Two months ago we asked for new contributions to strengthen Poseidon and our operations in Hungary. Unfortunately, so far we have not received sufficient numbers of equipment and border guards,\u201d said Frontex Deputy Executive Director Gil Arias Fernandez. \u201cDespite additional funds, we may not be able help the countries that need assistance unless we receive the necessary equipment. I urge EU member states to consider pledging more assets needed by Frontex for these operations,\u201d he added. Because of the short distance between Turkey and the Greek islands, the smugglers cram migrants onto small boats. As a result, border guards must deal with a large number of incidents every day, including numerous search and rescue operations. In operation Poseidon, Frontex currently deploys 11 coastal patrol boats, two coastal patrol vessels, one offshore patrol vessel, two helicopters and two aircraft.

The figure was the third consecutive monthly record, jumping well past the previous high of more than 70,000 reached in June. Both the Eastern Mediterranean route and the Western Balkans were also well above the previous month\u2019s highs. This brings the number of detections in the January-July period to nearly 340 000, compared to 123 500 recorded in the same period of last year and 280 000 in all of 2014.

Although few migrants were detected, the border (which is 6 000 km long and runs continuously from Norway to Romania), remains the main entry point for smuggled excise goods, in particular cigarettes. The first quarter of 2015 was marked by seizure of significant amounts of illicit cigarettes smuggled in cars, on cargo trains or transported across border rivers. Cigarettes were found, for example, concealed in fuel tanks and hollowed out timber logs on Polish Ukrainian border. Large quantities of cigarettes were also found on floats on Nemen River, which forms a border between Belarus and Lithuania. Although just four people were detected hiding in cars and trains while crossing the European Union border, in one case, a Russian woman was found in a suitcase on a train from Moscow to Nice. The suitcase belonged to a French citizen, who was the woman\u2019s husband. When questioned at the border crossing between Poland and Belarus in Terespol, the couple said the reason for hiding in the suitcase was that the woman lacked relevant documents to enter the European Union.

During the operation that took place at nine EU airports from 12 June to 8 July, teams including border guards and experts from five international organisations and non-governmental organisation worked together to help combat the plight of child trafficking.\u00a0 The teams helped identify children at risk and on the move and referred them to welfare and child protection institutions while applying the standard operational procedures based on the VEGA Children Handbook. The handbook was prepared by Frontex and its partners. \u201cWith the Joint Operation VEGA Children 2015, we are facilitating the cooperation of border guards and various organisations dealing with the problem of children trafficking.

It is noteworthy that of the 44 000 detected migrants, more than 27 500 were nationals of the Western Balkans. At the EU external borders, Greek and Hungarian borders were the most affected. Albanians were the most frequently detected nationality at the Greek-Albanian border, contributing to the well-known circular migration between the two countries.\u00a0 The Hungarian \u2013Serbian border was affected by a very high influx of migrants from Kosovo* (over 20 000), who constituted over 62% of the flow. The nationalities of the remaining 38% of the migrants detected at this border corresponded closely to the nationalities of migrants who had arrived from Turkey to the Greek islands. The majority of the transiting migrants were Syrian and Afghan nationals, but there were also growing numbers of Iraqis, Pakistanis and Somalis, as well as Bangladeshi and Iranians. Upon detection, both regional and transiting migrants claimed asylum in Hungary, but few remained in the country to complete the process. The high numbers of Afghans (over 6 000 in the first quarter of 2015), who were detected first in Greece and then in the Western Balkans can be partially explained by the changing status of Afghan migrants already living in the third countries. One contributing factor may be the expiry at the end of June 2015 of resident visas of over 500 000 Afghans currently living in Iran. It is unclear how many will have their visas renewed given the plans of the Iranian government to repatriate foreigners living on its territory.\u00a0 Another important development is the tightening of labour laws in Saudi Arabia, where many Afghans work. All these factors, combined with the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, contribute to the movement of nationals of Afghanistan towards the EU. The increased flow of migrants arriving in Greece and continuing their journey via the Western Balkans fuels the development of people smuggling networks in the region. Between January and March, over 500 facilitators were detected, which constitutes a slight increase from the previous quarter. Over 70% of these facilitators were nationals of Western Balkan countries, in particular Serbia. As in 2014, Kosovo citizens and nationals of the visa exempt Western Balkan countries (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, FYR Macedonia) continued to apply for international protection in the EU, in particular in Germany, despite very low chances of being granted asylum. * This designation is without prejudice to positions on the status of territory, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.

During the meeting, the two discussed the current migratory pressure at the external borders of the European Union. \u201cThe situation in Central Mediterranean, in Greece and in Hungary is particularly concerning,\u201d said Fabrice Leggeri.\u00a0 \u201cIn line with the \u2018hot spot\u2019 approach - part of the Agenda for Migration which was recently tabled by the European Commission, Frontex has recently opened the European Regional Task Force in Italy where, together with other EU agencies, we are assisting the Italian authorities in managing the migratory flows,\u201d he added. Since the beginning of the year, over 67 000 migrants have arrived in the area covered by Operation Triton, most of them originating from Eritrea, Nigeria, Somalia and a variety of Sub-Saharan and West African countries.\u00a0 This year, Greece has registered a significant increase in the number of irregular migrants when compared to the same period in 2014. More than 79 000 migrants arrived mainly on the Greek islands since the beginning of the year until June 2015.

This represents a 149% increase when compared to the same pe\u00adriod in 2014 when 61 500 migrants entered Europe. In May the total number of detections rose by 26% in relation to April and reached 50 500. Considering seasonal trends, it is expected that the migratory pressure will continue to increase during the summer period on all routes. Compared to April, the largest increase was reported on the Western Balkan route (the Hungarian land border with Serbia) where in May the number of apprehended migrants exceeded 10 000. In the period between 1 January and 31 May 2015, over 50 000 migrants were detected on this route which constitutes an 880% increase com\u00adpared to the same period in 2014. The land route towards Hungary constitutes the main transit route for migrants who entered the EU from Greece and Bulgaria. This route is considered safer than other routes by migrants from Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries and the fares charged by people smugglers are lower. Overall, in May, some 19 000 migrants used the Eastern Mediterranean route - a 32% increase since April. Since the beginning of the year, detections on the Eastern Mediterranean route have exceeded 48 000, which is almost five and a half times more than last year. This large increase, mostly due to the rise in the number of Syrian and Afghan migrants poses a significant challenge to the reception capacity in the Greek Aegean Islands.The migratory situation in Central Mediterranean remains difficult. In May the numbers of detected migrants exceeded 20 500 - the highest monthly level this year and a 29% increase compared to April. In the period between 1 January to 31 May 2015, there were over 47 000 arrivals in Italy, a moderate increase (+14%) compared to the same period in 2014. Most migrants arriving in Italy this year depart from Libya (over 42 000), but also to a much smaller extent from Egypt (1 740), Turkey (770), Greece (719) and Tunisia (256). Compared to the first four months of 2014, detections in the Western Mediterranean have increased both on its land and sea borders: with 108% increase at Spain\u2019s land borders between Morocco and Ceuta and Melilla (over 3\u00a0200) was reported at the sea route between Morocco and Algeria towards the Spanish Levante coast.

In fact, detections of illegal border-crossing reached 62 000, which translates into a 180% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2014. Whilst the main routes used by migrants did not change, the distribution between particular border sections shifted. For the first time, the highest migratory pressure was in the Western Balkans, at the border between Serbia and Hungary, where over 33 000 migrants entered the EU. Two main factors contributed to this increase: a high number of nationals of Kosovo, and a significant increase in the number of migrants arriving in the Aegean islands from Turkey and then continuing their journey across the Western Balkans. Among the latter, non-regional migrants, Syrians and Afghans constituted the majority. The first quarter also saw a record number of asylum requests, with over 181 000 applications filed across the EU. The majority of asylum applications were submitted in just three countries: Germany, Hungary and Italy. Noteworthy is the increase in the number of migrants entering the EU hidden in lorries, buses and trains. In particular, there was an increase in the detection of migrants in Bulgaria hiding in cargo trains arriving from Turkey. Although the number of detections of document fraud decreased slightly in comparison with the same period last year, migrants using fraudulent documents to enter the EU originated from more than 90 countries. Syrians, Moroccans and Nigerians constituted the majority. Lagos was the top embarkation airport for false document users, with over 180 fraudsters departing there. In the Western Mediterranean, migration remained at a relatively low level but the number of detections at the land borders in Ceuta and Melilla quadrupled compared with the previous quarter.

These increases more than made up for the fall in migration from North and West Africa across this border.The Western Balkans also increased in importance as the place of origin of migrants. Some 36 000 of the region\u2019s residents accounted for illegal crossings into the EU in 2014, double the number from the previous year. Although high, the 2014 figure was still below the levels observed prior to visa liberalisation in 2009.Nationals of Kosovo were the main nationality detected at this border in 2014, accounting for almost four times as many illegal border-crossings as in 2013. There were also twice as many asylum seekers from Kosovo.This development was largely driven by regional factors such as the reopening of asylum centres in Hungary in July 2014 and various rumours spread by facilitators to encourage migrants to head for the EU. The influx from Kosovo began to increase after Hungary started accommodating family units requesting asylum in open centres. The wave of migrants from Kosovo continued in the first two months of 2015. Nationals of the five visa-exempt Western Balkan countries submitted more than 48 000 asylum applications in EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries in 2014, which accounted for 9% of all asylum applications in the EU. More than three-quarters of the claims by residents of the Western Balkans were submitted in Germany were migrants travelled after initiating asylum procedures in Hungary.

During the peak summer season, Triton will deploy 3 airplanes, 6 Offshore Patrol Vessels, 12 patrol boats, 2 helicopters, 9 debriefing and 6 screening teams.\u201cWe have dramatically increased the deployment levels in the Central Mediterranean to support the Italian authorities in controlling its sea borders and in saving lives, too many of which have already been tragically lost this year,\u201d Fabrice Leggeri said.The European Commission will soon provide Frontex with additional EUR 26.25 million to strengthen Operation Triton in Italy and Poseidon Sea in Greece from June 2015 until the end of the year. The budget for Triton for this year will stand at EUR 38 million and EUR 18 million for Poseidon Sea.Next year, the European Commission will provide Frontex with additional EUR 45 million for the two operations. Frontex will also intensify its efforts to dismantle people smuggling networks by deploying nine debriefing teams.\u201cThe role of the debriefing officers is particularly important because they collect intelligence about the criminals operating in Libya and other countries of transit. In this way Frontex is assisting the Italian authorities and Europol in their investigations and efforts to dismantle the smuggling networks preying on desperate people,\u201d he added.Another important development is the establishment of a regional base in Sicily from which Frontex will coordinate the operation and work closely with liaison officers from Europol, Eurojust and EASO in support of the Italian authorities.A total of 26 European countries are taking part in Triton by deploying experts and technical equipment. These are: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.

This trend was the most pronounced near the end of last year.In contrast to the EU\u2019s borders with the Russian Federation, the number of travellers at the border with Ukraine has been growing despite the conflict in the eastern part of the country and the deteriorating economic situation in the region. The number of people who were refused entry reported by EU Member States at the eastern borders fell to almost 36 700 down from over 50 000 in 2013, although these still accounted for a third of all refusals at EU borders.The falling value of the rouble and the Ukrainian hryvnia, which increased the price differences between the EU and its eastern neighbours, encouraged the smuggling of goods across EU\u2019s eastern borders. The smuggling, particularly of cigarettes, occurred pri\u00admarily through official border-crossing points (BCPs), although some took place at green borders (be\u00adtween BCPs). The methods used to bring goods across the border varied from the so-called ant smuggling through BCPs to the use of rafts on rivers to smuggle large amounts of cigarettes across the common borders. Even though 2014 was marked by fewer incidents, they involved larger amounts of smuggled il\u00adlicit cigarettes.The situation in Ukraine, the consequences of the economic crisis in Russia and its migration policy remain the most important uncertainties affecting the outlook for the region. So far the impact of the Ukrainian crisis on border security has remained limited, but it still is by far the most important source of current and future population movements in the region, considering that the number of internally displaced person in the country surpassed one million. \u00a0 \u00a0 Files available for download Publications/Risk_Analysis/EB_ARA_2015.pdf (3.9 MB) ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/eastern-european-borders-annual-risk-analysis-2015-published-3HncmG"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0450", "date": "2015-05-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Enlarged Triton helping rescue migrants", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Enlarged Triton helping rescue migrants 2015-05-04 More than 5 500 migrants have been rescued near the Libyan coast since Thursday, 30 April.

The record number of 280 000 detections was mainly fuelled by the ongoing fighting in Syria, which has caused the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War. Syrians fleeing their country were the largest group of irregular migrants seeking to enter the EU.Most of the detections were reported as part of search and rescue operations in the Central Mediterranean area. Although border control authorities continued to save the lives of thousands of people, smugglers increasingly used unsafe boats, putting migrants in greater danger.The unprecedented number of migrants also encouraged facilitators to use cargo ships to smuggle them at a large scale. Starting in September, such vessels took migrants directly from the Turkish coast near Mersin to Italy. This is a multi-million-euro business for organised crime groups, which is likely to be replicated in other departure countries.Another trend explained by the Frontex risk analysis experts has been the increasing number of deliberate attempts to involve merchant ships in rescuing migrants. This has prompted the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to voice the concerns of the shipping industry over its involvement in rescuing migrants.The profile of detected irregular migrants remained relatively unchanged compared to 2013. They are mostly adult males, although the proportion of women (11%) and children (15%) reflects the fact that many migrants intend to claim asylum.More than 60% (170 000) of all illegal border crossings were detected in the Central Mediterranean. On the second most frequented route in the Eastern Mediterranean covering borders of Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus, there were more than 50 000 detections. Near the end of 2014, detections increased sharply at the Hungarian land border with Serbia, making the Western Balkan route the third most important irregular migration route with more than 43 000 detections.\u00a0Detections of migrants hidden in vehicles seeking to enter the EU via regular border crossings surged to over 3 000, five times the number from the previous year. This jump was due to a tenfold increase in detections reported from the Bulgarian border crossings along the land border with Turkey.\u00a0In 2014, there were some 9 400 incidents of document fraud on entry to the EU/ Schengen area from third countries, which represented a slight decrease compared to the previous year. By contrast, cases reported on intra-EU Schengen movements showed a 27 percent increase to almost 10 000. This marked the first year where there were more fraudulent documents detected on intra-EU/Schengen movements than dur\u00ading border checks of passengers arriving from third countries. This was partly due to the large number of migrants undertaking secondary movements within the EU, often with fraud\u00adulent documents obtained in the country of their entry into the EU.\u00a0 \u00a0 Files available for download Publications/Risk_Analysis/Annual_Risk_Analysis_2015.pdf (11.7 MB) ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/frontex-publishes-annual-risk-analysis-2015-lA1x1g"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0454", "date": "2015-04-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "2 400 migrants rescued off Libyan coast before Easter", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus 2 400 migrants rescued off Libyan coast before Easter 2015-04-08 Italian authorities rescued 2 400 migrants who left Libya on wooden fishing boats and rubber dinghies ahead of the Easter holiday last week, including 318 migrants rescued by Icelandic Coast Guard vessel T\u00fdr taking part in the Frontex-coordinated Joint Operation Triton.The migrants took advantage of a brief window of favourable weather starting at the beginning of April to venture out in hopes of reaching the Italian coast.\u201cOnce again a vessel participating in the Frontex-coordinated Triton operation took part in the rescue of migrants and did so close to the Libyan coast.

The focus will be on operational challenges and solutions, with an emphasis on the technologies and services that could change the current border checks paradigm and their potential impact on day-to-day operations at the border. The event will explore issues such as: How to verify the traveller\u2019s identity in a reliable manner early in the travel process;How to identify, through advance risk analysis, persons of interest who should be subject to further examination by border guards upon their arrival to the physical border;How to bring together point solutions to enable end-to-end facilitation; andHow to incorporate societal concerns into a revisited border control paradigm. The conference will also examine cutting-edge research developments in the area of personal identification, which in the future could be used to advance technological innovations in the border control domain. The target audience consists of national authorities from the EU Member States and other countries, EU policy-makers, international organisations, airport authorities, carriers, as well as industry representatives and researchers involved in developing innovative border checks solutions.A programme outline will be published shortly.

Such high numbers were mainly caused by the unprecedented numbers of Kosovo* nationals crossing the Serbian-Hungarian border illegally. However, this migratory flow also included other nationalities, primarily Afghans and Syrians travelling from Turkey via Greece and Bulgaria.As a consequence of increased border control measures introduced by Hungary, Serbia and an information campaign in Kosovo*, the migratory flows of Kosovans dramatically decreased starting in mid-February 2015.In the Central Mediterranean, high numbers of migrants departed from Libya, defying seasonal lows typical for the winter season, the most hazardous time to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Italy. Worth noting is the change in the composition of the nationalities of migrants leaving Libya, namely an increase in sub-Saharan migrants and a drop in the number of Syrians. The latter is also attributed to the increasingly more dangerous situation in Libya which has made travelling through Libya more dangerous. In addition, Tunisia and Algeria have introduced visa regime for Syrians who travelled to either of these countries by air before proceeding by land to the Libyan coast.\u00a0On the Eastern Mediterranean route, the number of detections on the Greek Aegean Islands more than doubled. It should be noted that no cargo vessels carrying migrants from Turkey were detected at the EU\u2019s external borders since 2 January.*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence. \u00a0 Files available for download Images_News/Illegal_border_crossing_routes_February__2015.pdf (246.9 KB) ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/situational-update-on-migratory-flows-in-february-2015-R7HeSD"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0459", "date": "2015-02-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Migrants forced to board inflatable rafts at gunpoint", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Migrants forced to board inflatable rafts at gunpoint 2015-02-12 Today the African migrants who survived the traumatic events off the coast of Libya told Frontex debriefing officers that smugglers who organised the operation forced them at gunpoint onto the inflatable rafts.The interviewed migrants were among the more than 400 people who boarded four dinghies on a beach near Tripoli on Saturday night and headed for Italy. The survivors told officials that the smugglers threatened to shoot on the spot anyone who refused to get into the four inflatable rafts.The Italian Coast Guard assisted by vessels participating in the Operation Triton rescued 105 people on one of the vessels on Monday, although 29 of them died on hypothermia.\u00a0The Coast Guard later redirected two merchant vessels to rescue nine more survivors from the other rafts. The rest of the migrants likely perished in the treacherous winter sea.\u201cThese stories point to an awful crime.

The two airplanes remain involved in the ongoing search operations for the missing African migrants led by the Italian Coast Guard.

On Monday night a rubber boat with 106 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa was rescued by the Italian Coast Guard, which conducted a rescue operation 120 NM from Lampedusa. Twenty-nine of the rescued migrants, including three minors, died of hypothermia. Two of the four vessels that rescued the migrants 40 NM from Tripoli are taking part in operation Triton.The inflatable raft rescued on Monday was one of several that left a beach near Tripoli on Saturday. At least 300 migrants are feared dead.Since the launch of the Triton operation in November, Frontex helped to save 6,000 of the 19,000 migrants on their way to Italy.\u201cWhen I was in Sicily last week, I saw in person how dangerous the Mediterranean Sea can be in the winter. Venturing out on small rubber boats in high winds and such low temperatures puts all the people aboard in grave danger,\u201d Leggeri said. During his first visit to EU external borders since taking office in January, Leggeri met last week with the officers deployed in the Triton operation. He also visited a reception centre in Pozzallo, where he observed a debriefing of migrants who put their lives at risk to reach the Italian coast.

This is two and a half times larger than the year before (107 000) and twice as much as in 2011 (141 000) dur\u00ading the initial stages of the Arab Spring. This increase is mostly connected to the increas\u00ading number of refugees and displaced people worldwide, related to the ongoing conflict in Syria and its spread to Iraq, which have cre\u00adated the worst refugee crisis since the Sec\u00adond World War. Following recent increases, in December 2014 Kosovo nationals were for the first time the migrants most commonly detected il\u00adlegally crossing the external border of the EU/Schengen area, accounting for a massive 40% of total detections. This trend has been linked with rumours among the Kosovo population that France\u2019s decision to remove Kosovo from the national list of safe coun\u00adtries will make it much more straightfor\u00adward to obtain asylum in this Member State. Kosovans and Afghans were the only two major nationalities that were detected more frequently in December than in No\u00advember, which stands in marked contrast with the normal seasonal decreases seen at this time of year. Both nationalities were mostly detected on the Western Balkan route while attempting to illegally enter Hungary from Serbia. At this border, de\u00adtections in December reached a record of more than 12 000 detections, compared to about 7 500 in November 2014. On the Central Mediterranean route, de\u00adtections totalled more than 6 700, a de\u00adcrease compared to November (~9 400), but still considerably higher than a year ago in December 2013 (~2 700). Each year between November and March, detections tend to be lower than in any other period as winter conditions make it more difficult to cross the border and to travel over long distances in general, especially in Europe. On the Eastern Mediterranean route, de\u00adtections in December fell to about 2 400, a decrease of 44% compared to Novem\u00adber (~4 400), but still much above the level of December 2013 (~1 500). Despite the de\u00adcrease, detections on the Eastern Medi\u00adterranean route made headlines with the spectacular rescue of one cargo ship in Greece and two large fishing vessels near Cyprus. All ships had departed from Mersin area in Tur\u00adkey and intended to reach Italy. These inci\u00addents, widely reported in the media, were not isolated cases, as in December a total of seven cargo vessels departing from around Turkey were intercepted, involving a total of more than 3 000 migrants. These cases, followed by other cases in Jan\u00aduary 2015, signal a radical scaling up of the means of transport acquired by smugglers to ship migrants from Turkey to the EU. In\u00addeed, an increasing number of migrants are present in Turkey and ready to pay large sums of money for their trip to Europe (up to EUR 7 000). The large profit associated with low risk for the main smugglers, are likely to trigger similar incidents in the future. \u00a0 ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/latest-trends-at-external-borders-of-the-eu-6Z3kpC"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0467", "date": "2015-01-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Update: ICGV T\u00fdr conducts search and rescue of 450 migrants", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Update: ICGV T\u00fdr conducts search and rescue of 450 migrants 2015-01-03 At midnight the Icelandic coast guard vessel ICGV T\u00fdr, which is deployed in Frontex-coordinated joint operation Triton, brought the cargo vessel Ezadeen with 360 migrants on board to the southern Italian port of Corigliano Calabro.

Detections at Italy\u2019s sea border represented almost 50% of all detected illegal border-crossings that quarter. For the first quarter since FRAN data collection began, Malians were the most reported nationality at that maritime border, followed by Eritreans and Syrians.By the end Q1 2014, migratory movements across Italy\u2019s sea border resumed quickly after the winter seasonal decline. Of note was the speed at which migration appeared to regain momentum: in March the number of arrivals in Italy and Malta reached the exceptionally high levels of summer 2013. Also, analysis of the different waves of migrant boats that have targeted Italy\u2019s sea border since November 2013 suggests development of the logistical & organisational capacities of the criminal groups which facilitate the gathering and embarkation of migrants along Libya\u2019s coast.Increased operational activity in the Eastern Mediterranean led to a fall in detections of illegal border-crossing. Since Bulgarian authorities started a special police operation at the Bulgaria-Turkey border, migratory movements originally displaced by Greek operation Aspida from Greece\u2019s border to Bulgaria\u2019s fell substantially. The fact that the overall number of illegal border-crossings on the Eastern Mediterranean route was still higher than 2013 can be attributed to detections made in the Aegean Sea.Hungary reported the highest number of illegal border-crossings at a land border in Q1 2014. Although the number of detections at the Hungary-Serbia border has been stable since Q4 2013, a significant increase was reported compared with Q1 2013.\u00a0The land border with the biggest increase of illegal border-crossings, compared to both Q4 2013 and Q1 2013, was around Spain\u2019s enclaves: Ceuta and Melilla. The number of persons entering Spain via that route tripled comparing to Q1 2013. While migrants with sufficient funds used the services of people-smuggling networks to reach Spain, hidden in motor vehicles, the majority of those trying to reach Spanish territory opted to simply climb the fences, often in large groups. The attempted borders breaches at Spain\u2019s enclaves were part of a general shift from sea borders to land borders on the Western Mediterranean route. The reasons for that may include strengthened surveillance at sea.This period saw an increasing number of asylum applications. Although this indicator shows a clear decline at the beginning of each year, the annual total asylum seekers has risen by almost 20% annually since 2010. Simultaneously, asylum seekers increasingly focus on top destination countries. Since 2010, the proportion of applications for asylum in Germany and Sweden grew from around 33% to 50% of the total reported to FRAN.\u00a0In Bulgaria, asylum applications fell by approximately 33% after peaking in Q4 2013. This fall coincided with a drop in detections of illegal border-crossing at the Bulgaria-Turkey land border. In other Member States, asylum applications remained fairly stable. Syrians submitted one in five applications for international protection, being the leading nationality for the third consecutive quarter. Syrians haven\u2019t followed the same seasonal pattern as other nationalities, which showed a substantial decline in applications during winter. Since the start of the war in Syria, a rather insignificant drop in applications during winter is normally followed by a larger increase during the following summer, with the respective curve resembling more upward stairs than the usual waves. Around 75% of Syrian asylum seekers submitted their application in the top asylum countries (Germany, Sweden, Bulgaria and the Netherlands).\u00a0Compared to Q1 2013, document fraud fell in Q1 2014 in terms of detections from third countries on entry to the EU and Schengen zone. Spain, Italy, France and Greece together accounted for more than half of all cases at the EU level. The long-term upward trend in Spain continued in Q1 2014, with Spain reporting more detections than ever, mainly at Madrid airport and Ceuta/Melilla.

The growth was driven by expanding legal travel channels \u2014 growing visa issuance and implementation of local border traffic agreements \u2014 as well as by longer-term economic developments in the EB-RAN countries and the Russian Federation encouraging mobility of people and goods. Increasing traffic has generated considerable pressure on border crossing points\u2019 (BCPs) capacity to keep the flows smooth and secure. Secondly, smuggling of goods remained a significant factor in border policing. Data collected within EB-RAN countries, as well as during Frontex-coordinated joint operations, indicate that the smuggling of tobacco products was particularly common. Smuggling occurred primarily through official BCPs; however, a variety of modi operandi were also detected. These included so-called \u2018ant smuggling\u2019 (smuggling of small amounts of excise goods and illegal substances through the BCPs) to the use of rafts across the border rivers to smuggle large quantities of cigarettes. Additionally, cross-border criminal activities also included attempts to transport stolen cars and motorcycles from the European Union to EB-RAN countries. The illicit drugs being smuggled ranged from cannabis and synthetic drugs either transiting the EU or originating in it and being transported to the EB-RAN countries, and heroin and amphetamine precursors being brought into the EU. Thirdly, though there was a slight increase in detections of illegal border crossings compared to the previous year, overall in 2013 these remained low when compared to other sections of the EU\u2019s external borders and at 1,316 accounted for only 1.2 percent of the EU total. This is possibly due to the fact that the route via EB-RAN countries or the Russian Federation towards the EU involves logistical difficulties and high costs, especially for migrants coming from beyond the region. Efficient cooperation between border-control authorities on both sides of the common borders also creates a higher risk of detection than other routes. In contrast to the rather low level of illegal border crossings, the phenomenon of migrants being refused entry who then applied for asylum and subsequently absconded from reception centres was the most serious in terms of magnitude. The number of refusals of entry rose to over 50,000, i.e. 39 percent of the EU total, indicating a growing risk of abuse of legal travel channels. While the large number of refusals of entry can be partly explained by growth in regular traffic, two individual phenomena stood out in 2013: 1) a sharp increase of nationals of the Russian Federation of Chechen origin refused entry and then using asylum applications in Poland as a way to enter the EU and then move on to Germany; 2) the continued flow of Georgian nationals to Poland and further on to other EU member states using a variety of methods. In both cases, the main entry point was the Polish-Belarusian border. The use of this modus operandi appears to be a significant entry channel of irregular migration to the EU as it exploits possibilities for legal entry while still absorbing a significant proportion of border-control resources. The abuse of visas in order to work irregularly and/or stay in other member states for longer than permitted by the visa was also reported, including continued use of fraudulent supporting documentation and falsified stamps to conceal evidence of overstaying. The situation in Ukraine is the main uncertainty considering the border-security outlook. So far, in terms of EU border security, the impact of the crisis is limited. Population movements from the contested areas, especially Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, are possible. At the same time, economic and political instability may cause changes to labour migration, thus possibly also affecting irregular movements. An important positive development is the implementation of the EU-Moldova visa liberalisation in April 2014, which can be seen as a sign of enhanced border security and cooperation in the region promoting bona fide cross-border mobility without compromising border security.

This figure is 27% higher than in the previous year and half of the irregular migrants were detected at the Hungarian-Serbian border. Croatia\u2019s accession to the EU on 1 July 2013 has had no effect on migratory flows in the region. The detections at the border between Serbia and Hungary mostly occurred in the first half of the year. This sharp rise in the number of irregular migrants coincided with a change in asylum procedure in Hungary at the beginning of 2013 which lifted the detention requirement for asylum seekers. Following Hungary\u2019s reintroduction of detention for asylum seekers in July, the flow of irregular migrants dropped significantly. As a region surrounded by EU member states, the Western Balkans continued to largely be a transit area for migrants moving between different EU countries, in particular between Greece and Hungary. Compared to 2012, detections of transiting non-European irregular migrants stayed at the same level (approximately 22,000). Significant differences emerged however, in terms of countries of origin: there was a sharp decline in the number of migrants from Afghanistan, North Africa and Somalia and a large increase in the number of migrants from West Africa, mostly from Mali, Nigeria and Ghana. The most common modus operandi for irregular movements was border crossing of green borders by foot and then meeting with facilitators who provided onward transport. When detected, almost all migrants claimed asylum. The abuse of visa-free travel through mostly unfounded asylum application in the EU remained at the same level as in 2012. In 2013 nationals of five visa exempt Western Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) submitted 33,000 asylum applications in the EU.\u00a0 Seven out of ten claims were submitted in Germany alone and of the five visa-exempt Western Balkan nationalities, nationals of Serbia accounting for a 45% share of the total.

The number of Syrians detected at the EU borders accounted for almost a quarter of all arrivals in 2013 and at 25,500 was almost three times the 2012 figure. Syrians were also the commonest nationality detected for illegal entry in most border areas and headed the list for requests for international protection. More than two thirds of all such applications by Syrians were submitted in Sweden, Germany and Bulgaria. The Central Mediterranean area was the main entry point to Europe for irregular migrants, particularly during the second half of the year. Migrant flows across the Central Mediterranean to Italy, and to a lesser extent Malta, were heaviest between July and October, reaching a peak in September, though arrivals continued in Italy throughout October and November despite rough sea conditions, which usually prevent sea crossings at that time of year. With over 40,000 arrivals recorded, the Central Mediterranean route accounted for 38% of all detections of irregular migration at EU level. But while this figure constitutes a significant increase on 2012, it is still lower than during the 2011 Arab Spring when 59,000 migrants arrived in Italy. This route also saw several major incidents of boats capsizing and sinking, including the October tragedy off the coast of Lampedusa that claimed lives of over 360 people.While Syrians and Egyptians departed for Italy primarily from Egypt in 2013, migrants from the Horn of Africa and West Africa departed mostly from Libya. Among African migrants, Eritreans were by far the most numerously detected, with over 11,000 arrivals, representing a four-fold increase on 2012. To reach Italy, migrants from the Horn of Africa typically used a perilous route across the Sahara, travelling onward through Libya. On the Western Mediterranean route, detections at the Greek borders with Turkey were at their lowest level in five years though this route still accounted for almost a quarter of all detections in the EU. The largest numbers of migrants in this region were either detected crossing the Aegean Sea to the Greek islands from Turkey, or along the Bulgarian-Turkish land border. Again, Syrians constituted the majority of migrants on this route. \u00a0\u00a0At 19,000, the number of detections at the border between Hungary and Serbia was almost three times that of a year earlier and made the Western Balkan route the number-three hot spot for illegal border crossings in Europe.\u00a0 Files available for download Publications/Risk_Analysis/Annual_Risk_Analysis_2014.pdf (11 MB) ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/frontex-publishes-annual-risk-analysis-2014-wc71Jn"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0481", "date": "2014-01-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Frontex and eu-LISA sign Working Arrangement", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Frontex and eu-LISA sign Working Arrangement 2014-01-31 Ilkka Laitinen and Krum Garkov Warsaw, 31 January 2014 \u2014 Frontex and the European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems (eu-LISA) signed a Working Arrangement today at Frontex headquarters in Warsaw.

In this regard, Frontex seeks to put more emphasis on organizing, with the help of Member States, practical demonstrations of new technologies.Surveillance of EU external borders has to ensure effective detection of irregular immigration activities. The technical systems involved include different types of sensor and specific communication systems and software, in order to create a situational picture and to make it available to participants involved in a specific operation.Hovering electro-optical systems (together with other sensor systems) can play important roles in further enhancing border surveillance filling the gaps not covered by other border surveillance activities. These technologies are also of relevance for the development of the common European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR).Frontex Research and Development Unit in cooperation with the Finnish Border Guard is organizing a demonstration and workshop, during which relevant industry will present to Member States\u2019 experts the latest achievements on \"Hovering electro-optical systems\" for sea and land border surveillance.The main objective of the event is to facilitate a dialogue between industry, Member States and Frontex on current developments in sea surveillance and land border surveillance and future developments with regards to above mentioned technologies.Frontex therefore will invite relevant industry to present its latest achievements in this domain.Four to six leading companies in the field of border surveillance technology will demonstrate their systems\u2019 capabilities in real operational scenarios.

This, combined with sustained detections in the Ionian and Eastern Aegean Seas, meant there were more detections of illegal border-crossing at the EU maritime borders than during the height of the 2011 \u2018Arab Spring.\u2019 There were also more applications for international protection than at any other time since data collection began for this indicator in 2008. Syrians were the most detected nationality at EU level in terms of irregular border crossing (across several locations and border types) as well as in terms of clandestine entry, illegal stay, and document fraud at both the external border and on intra-Schengen flights. Additionally, Syrians submitted more applications for asylum than any other nationality. Across the spectrum of indicators used to identify trends, Syrians clearly stood out.\u00a0 There were 42,618 detections of illegal border crossing in Q3 2013 at the EU level \u2014 almost twice the level of Q3 2012 \u2014 and a four-fold increase on the first quarter of 2013. This was almost exclusively due to increased detections from the Italian sea border, mostly reported from Sicily and off the island of Lampedusa, where detections totalled more than 12,000 and 8,000 respectively. Across the region the use of large \u2018mother-ships\u2019 became more common, an earlier-identified modus operandi involving the towing of smaller vessels for transfer of migrants when closer to shore. In Greece, previously the main EU hot-spot , detections remained stable between the second and third quarters but were still high enough for Greece to be ranked number two for illegal entry. This is because Greece continued to be affected by two independent flows of irregular migration: via both Turkey and Albania. However, since Greece reinforced its land border with Turkey in August 2012, detections there have dropped to negligible levels. Elsewhere meanwhile, detections have increased, particularly in the Eastern Aegean Sea and at the Bulgarian land border with Turkey, which in the third quarter ranked fourth and fifth among all sections of the EU external border. In these two locations detections increased going into the third quarter, mostly of Syrians, and to a lesser extent of Afghans. In Bulgaria, the 600% year-on-year increase in detections was the largest in the EU and was accompanied by an increase in asylum applications. Nationalities Syrians and Eritreans were the most commonly detected nationalities, followed by Somalis and Egyptians. While most migrants arriving by boat had set sail from Libya, many Egyptians had left from their own country. There were also increased detections of Syrians and Eritreans in Apulia and Calabria, in southern Italy, putting these nationalities on top for detections at EU level. Detections of Eritreans increased the most in comparison to the same period last year. After Sicily and Lampedusa, the next most affected border section was the Hungarian land border with Serbia, where detections fluctuated dramatically throughout 2013 in response to a series of legislative changes affecting asylum seekers. Detections here were almost twice that of a year earlier but 50% down on the previous quarter. Albanians At the Greek land border with Albania, detections of illegal border-crossing remained stable compared to the previous year, almost exclusively of Albanian \u2018circular\u2019 migrants moving for seasonal work. Detections of Albanians using document fraud to gain entry to Greece decreased in Q3 2013, but refusals of entry and detections of\u00a0 illegal stay increased for Albanians to 1 471, the highest level seen in Greece for several years. Given that Albanians were also widely detected in other member states, particularly using fraudulent documents to enter the UK from the Schengen area, and as illegal stayers and subject to decisions to leave in France, the irregular migratory pressure from this nationality remains high. Document fraud Use of fraudulent documents was increasingly detected in the Q3 2013 both in terms of detections at the external border and also of migrants making secondary movements within the Schengen area, or attempting entry to the UK. Spain, Italy, France and Greece detected the highest numbers at the external borders, together accounting for more than half of all detections at EU level. For the second quarter in a row, Spain reported more detections than ever before, the most common of which being Moroccans detected at either Melilla or Ceuta.

Within this context, new state-of-the-art technological solutions can help promote more effective and efficient border controls. However, technology is not an end in itself but a means to serve policy objectives. The European Commission drives forward the policy work needed to further develop EU integrated border management with the support of Frontex on the operational side, while eu-LISA, the EU Agency for large-scale IT systems, manages the technical implementation of new border management systems. The success of ABC deployments depends, crucially, on gaining passengers\u2019 acceptance and reaching high levels of usage. This requires that, in the design of ABC solutions, the passenger should always be kept at the heart of the process. Another success factor concerns the establishment of close cooperation and mutual trust, notably between border management authorities and airport operators. Such trust presupposes the recognition of a common interest in facilitating passenger flows. But ABC deployments are not merely an efficiency issue. Border management technologies have important societal implications and data protection authorities should be involved in the design and implementation of ABC solutions. Citizens should remain confident that their biometric data are properly handled. Also importantly, the role of the \u201chuman factor\u201d of border guards continues to be essential in the operation of ABC systems. ABC is not about replacing the border guard with technology, but about providing a tool to support their work. Finally, ABC itself is not enough \u2014 it is only one step of the travel process. The future lies in integrated solutions which rely on the handling of data in order to facilitate passenger flows and maintain the border security.

The document, created in line with the Frontex Regulation, sets out common principles and procedures for joint return operations coordinated by Frontex. The process of returning people on joint return flights is governed by strict procedures to ensure full respect for fundamental rights and the safety of returnees and other participants. The rules and best practices for return flights are now gathered in a single Code of Conduct. \u00a0The main aim of the Code is to ensure that all joint return operations are conducted as humanely as possible. A full chapter is dedicated to human rights monitoring. This function is carried out on most flights by observers from international organisations, NGOs or national authorities. The Code specifies that the monitors must have access to all relevant information, including travel documents of returnees and information about any special conditions, including pregnancy or illness. The Code also clearly specifies that medical personnel are required on every flight and if the escorting officers are not able to communicate with the returnees there should be interpreters on board. The Code stresses that the use of force should be avoided or limited to the minimum and emphasizes the importance of cooperation with returnees. All participants in Frontex joint operations are also obliged to report any incidents they believe violate the Code of Conduct during a return flight. The Code of Conduct was created in consultation with EU Member States and Frontex Consultative Forum. It is based on guidelines for joint returns created by Frontex in 2009, which contain detailed instructions for the practical implementation of joint returns. Best Practices for the removal of illegally present third-country nationals by air is notable not just for its level of detail, but for the attention it pays to safeguarding the rights of returnees. The document contains advice on everything from seating plans to dress codes, luggage allowances, and even what food should served on the plane to respect the dietary requirements of different religions.\u00a0\u00a0 Third country nationals who have exhausted all legal possibilities of staying in the EU, such as persons who have overstayed their visa or failed the asylum procedure, are subject to a return decision issued by a member state. In 2012 over 159 000 third country nationals were returned from the EU to their countries of origin. More than 2 000 of those were returned in joint return operations coordinated by Frontex.\u00a0 Joint return operations are organised when third country nationals are returned from several member states using one charter flight. In joint operations one of the member states charters a plane to take returnees back to their country of origin. When there are empty seats on the plane, the organising Member State contacts Frontex, which then offers those seats to the authorities of other member states, who can use the same charter flight for their returnees. People returned in joint operations are all subject to individual return decisions from member states.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Files available for download Publications/General/Code_of_Conduct_for_Joint_Return_Operations.pdf () ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/frontex-code-of-conduct-for-return-operations-published-x1a0c0"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0489", "date": "2013-10-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ABC Conference and Exhibition", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus ABC Conference and Exhibition 2013-10-07 On October 10-11, 2013, Frontex and the European Commission (DG HOME and DG ENTR) will hold the 2nd Global Conference and Exhibition on future developments of Automated Border Control (ABC).

Here, Libya often acts as nexus point where migrants from the Horn of Africa and Western African routes meet before embarking on their journey towards the EU. Until 2011, with its relatively prosperous economy, Libya offered good job opportunities for migrant workers from other African countries who either used it as a destination country or as a transit country where they could earn some money to pay smugglers for the last leg of their journey. The migrants arriving in Italy and Malta mostly use wooden fishing boats which are often overcrowded and thus prone to sinking or capsizing in high-sea conditions and are often ill-equipped with poor engines and navigation systems; two factors contributing to the risk to life. As a result of these practices, tens of thousands of people become the subject of search-and-rescue (SAR) in the Mediterranean every year. Frontex operations took part in almost 900 SAR cases off Europe\u2019s southern borders between 2011 and 2013, affecting almost 50,000 people in distress. While most migrants using this route depart from Libya and land on Lampedusa or Sicily, others also arrive on the southern Italian coast, around Calabria and Puglia. These migrants arrive on boats from the Turkish coast, Greece or Egypt. The smugglers are of many different nationalities and use different types of boat, but the smugglers using fishing boats are most commonly Egyptian nationals. Migratory trendsFor years, this route has been an important entry point to the EU for irregular migrants and in 2008 nearly 40 000 migrants were detected, mostly near Lampedusa and Malta. Most migrants were nationals of Tunisia, Nigeria, Somalia and Eritrea. This traffic stopped almost completely however after the Italian government signed a bilateral agreement with Libya in 2009. Civil unrest erupting in Tunisia and Libya in 2011 saw a massive spike in the number of migrants using this route (nearly 60 000 arrivals for the year). Between January and March only, some 20 000 Tunisians, mostly economic migrants heading mainly to France in search of job opportunities, arrived on the small Italian island of Lampedusa. These numbers were later reduced by 75% in the second quarter of the year as a result of an accelerated repatriation agreement between Italy and Tunisia. Between March and August 2011 however, exceptionally high numbers of sub-Saharan Africans departing from Libya arrived on Lampedusa and to a lesser degree on Sicily and Malta, many of whom were forcibly expelled by the Gaddafi regime and most of whom applied for asylum in Italy. With the end of the Gaddafi regime in August 2011, the migratory pressure dropped off greatly and detections on this route in 2012 stood at approximately 10 000. Between January and September 2013, more than 31 000 migrants had arrived in the EU using this route, mainly via Sicily and Lampedusa, but also, to a lesser extent, on the Coasts of Calabria, Puglia and Malta, which is also under increasing migratory pressure. The main nationalities include Eritreans, Somalis and other sub-Saharan Africans, as well as Syrian nationals. It is noteworthy that the migratory pressure over the summer months of 2013 was comparable to the same period in 2011.

First place was taken by Marcin Klepacki for his picture \"Crossroads.\" \u00a0 Curtis Budden, a professional photographer commissioned to judge the entries, said the winning image, \u201cgives the viewer plenty of room for interpretation. [...] The photographer uses leading lines and a shallow depth of field to direct us to the real subject of the image, which is not the bridge but the man standing on it. The fact that we cannot see what he sees adds an element of wonder to the photo. We are left to [...] think about what physical or psychological frontiers he might be trying to cross at that moment.\u201d While the winner was rewarded for technical and artistic merit, the second prize was won for another important criterion \u2014 relevance to the competition topic \u2014 by reflecting the distinctive nature of European borders. Curtis Budden said of the work: \"By placing two border posts in such a prominent position, we are left with no doubt that this is a border. But what we do not see are border guards or fences or any other form of separation. Instead, we can look out, unhindered, on the marvelous landscape of the Carpathian Mountains.\" \u00a0 Third place went to Jose Cordoba for his picture of the Strait of Gibraltar from the Spanish coast, overlooking Morocco just 14 kilometres across this natural border. \"The photographer uses his vantage point and composition to emphasize this proximity: our eye is led into the frame to a radar station that rises up into the Moroccan mountains across the Strait. We feel almost as if we could just reach across and touch them. At the same time, it is difficult to look at this image without thinking about what one would see standing on those mountains and looking toward Europe.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Honourable mentions were given to Mateusz Pi\u0105tek and Christian Skerbic for their photos of a trail through the Tatra Mountains on the Poland-Slovakia border and a footbridge connecting France and Germany across the Rhine, respectively.

Moreover, at around 73 000, it was the first year since systematic data collection started in 2008 that the total figure for the year stood at less than 100 000. The main reasons for these drops were two-fold. On the Central Mediterranean sea route to the EU, 2011 was marked by heavy influxes from Libya and Tunisia as a result of the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 uprisings. Those flows had fallen off by the end of 2011, and although arrivals on that route grew steadily throughout 2012, they totalled only around 10 300 by year-end. Meanwhile, on the Eastern Mediterranean route, migrant flows through the previous hot-spot of the Greek-Turkish land border were largely stemmed by increased efforts by the Greek authorities. The effects of the Aspida, or \u2018Shield,\u2019 operation by Greece had a dramatic effect on inflows. Weekly arrival rates of up to 2 000 were slashed to just 10 entries a week by October due to the deployment of 1 800 additional officers. While this drop in arrivals was offset to some extent by increased detections at both the maritime border in the Aegean Sea and at the Turkish-Bulgarian land border, the figures from these displacements fell far short of accounting for the difference. This was due in part to increased efforts by the Turkish and Bulgarian authorities. However there is believed to be pent-up migratory pressure inside Turkey representing a risk of resurgent irregular migration on that route when the Aspida operation ends. Consequently, looking ahead, the probability of a resurgence of irregular migration on this route remains high. Meanwhile, on the Western Mediterranean route from North Africa to Spain, detections of illegal border crossing fell by almost a quarter (-24%) on 2011. However, at 6 400, arrivals on this route were still above levels recorded in previous years. In terms of secondary movements, the drop in illegal entry via the Greek land border was not reflected in the traditional route for onward movement to the rest of the EU. The most established onward route, via the Western Balkans, recorded a 37% increase in detections on 2011 figures. Nationalities Concerning the most common nationalities detected entering the EU illegally, Syrian nationals stood out in comparison to 2011 both in terms of illegal entry and use of fraudulent documents. Despite the growth of this group however, Afghans remained the most commonly detected nationality for illegal entry though their total numbers were down considerably on the previous year (13 169 against 22 994). Afghans also headed the table for asylum applications in the EU in 2012, though much of the 7% increase in applications is attributable to Syrian nationals. Afghans, along with Moroccans, were also the most commonly detected for illegal stay within the EU.

The Agency proactively monitors and contributes to developments in research relevant to the control and surveillance of the external borders. Frontex also keeps Member States and the European Commission up to date with developments. Effective border control has to strike a balance between facilitating the movement of an increasing number of travellers across borders, and promoting greater security for European citizens. Innovative technologies, which are nowadays developing at an unprecedented pace, can provide valuable help to border management authorities to do their job more efficiently. Yet this important goal requires that border control technologies focus on addressing key challenges. They also need to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing circumstances and diverse conditions along the EU external border, and meet the needs of the border guard community. Moreover, in an EU with no internal border controls and with common external borders, another key challenge lies in fostering interoperability, i.e. the ability of different systems and national authorities to work together. Frontex plays a key role in bridging the gap between producers and end users, making sure that the research and development community has a clear picture of the needs and challenges faced daily at the EU\u2019s borders. The agency facilitates information exchange between border management authorities, research institutes, universities and industry, via the organisation of projects, workshops and conferences. It also informs EU research programmes under the Security Theme of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7) and provides input for policy development. In addition, Frontex is very active in driving the process of harmonisation and development of best practices and standards in border control, both operational and technical, in line with existing and future EU measures. Border management covers all activities carried out at the external border to address the issue of irregular migration. Yet the nature of the actions related to, and the technologies applied for border surveillance (between authorised Border Crossing Points, BCPs) and for border checks (at BCPs) are quite different. In order to cater for these different needs, Frontex research and development activities have been organised into two programmes, a border checks programme and a border surveillance programme. Specific considerations One of the objectives of the Frontex\u2019s R&D Unit for 2013 is to create a network/working group of experts of the Member States Border Authorities, specialized in the field of land border surveillance (Land Border Surveillance Working Group). For this year the Working Group will be focused on showcasing the existing practices and technologies in use for land border surveillance (in the Member States where the experts are coming from). Another priority will be the development of a set of minimum requirements for possible rapid deployable, cost-effective land border surveillance systems to be tested in Frontex joint operations 2014. In order to support the activity of the Member States\u2019 experts, there is a need of providing them with information on the Industry\u2019s latest achievements in cost-effective and fast deployable land border surveillance systems. On these lines, Frontex launches the present call for papers, inviting Industry to send to landsurwg@frontex.europa.eu and to Zdravko Kolev at zdravko.kolev@frontex.europa.eu, by10 May 2013, detailed technical presentations together with a white paper (pdf/word format, containing technical specifications, descriptions, relevant pictures) of its latest achievements/advanced technical solutions in this domain. The technical solutions will consist of combinations of at least the following types of sensor: radars, electro-optic sensors, unattended ground sensors, communication systems capable to transmit in near real time the situational picture and warnings on remote terminals. Frontex will not publish the papers received. They will be used as support documentation during the activity of the mentioned Working Group. After analyzing the Industry\u2019s submissions, four to six companies in the field of land border surveillance technology will be invited to present their submission to the Land Border Surveillance Working Group in October 2013. The submitters will be informed on a decision, by email, by June 2013. Please note that the papers submitted by industry will be selected on a first-come-first-served basis and their representatives might be invited to present them. The invitees are to cover by themselves the costs related to the participation in presentation.

Ms Aydan Iyig\u00fcng\u00f6r, of the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) and Stefan Kessler of the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) will serve for one year as Co-Chairs representing EU Agencies and NGOs respectively. Frontex Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen said: \u201cNowhere in Europe can you find a higher or more professional level of expert knowledge on Fundamental Rights than in our Consultative Forum. Not only respect for Fundamental Rights, but their active promotion, is a firm cornerstone of the agency\u2019s strategy and this forum reinforces that commitment.\u201d The FRA\u2019s Aydan Iyig\u00fcng\u00f6r also commented positively on the forum\u2019s creation. \u201cThe composition [of the Consultative Forum] is a strength in itself,\u201d she told journalists on the sidelines of the meeting. \u201cYou have a variety of civil society organisations, international organisations and EU agencies all bringing their knowledge on board from different dimensions of border management.\u201d The creation of a Consultative Forum on Fundamental Rights was enshrined in a 2011 revision to Frontex\u2019s founding regulation and will meet at least twice a year. Although the forum\u2019s role is advisory and it has no decision-making powers, it will deliver an annual report on Frontex\u2019s implementation of its Fundamental Rights obligations. It will also seek to have as practical a role as possible, as the JRS\u2019s Stefan Kessler was keen to emphasise. Underlining that the forum would address specific issues and scrutinise shortcomings, he also promised to be as inclusive as possible. \u201cThere are many organisations that are not represented on the Consultative Forum, which we will try to include as much as possible so that we get a comprehensive overview of what is happening at the borders,\u201d he said, \u201cso that we can really bring refugees\u2019 and migrants\u2019 voices to the table [\u2026] to influence the policies of the agency and of the border guards of the member states.\u201d Speaking on behalf of the European Commission, Belinda Pyke said: \u201cI warmly welcome that the Consultative Forum is now up and running and that the Fundamental Rights Officer has been delegated. These measures, and the ongoing implementation of other guarantees contained the revised Frontex Regulation, are a welcome and concrete sign that the Agency is fully committed to ensuring the respect of fundamental rights, both in its own work, including the joint operations it coordinates, and by the Member States, when participating in those operations.\u201d Organisations represented on the Consultative Forum are: Amnesty International European Institutions Office; Caritas Europa; Churches' Commission for Migrants in Europe; Council of Europe; European Asylum Support Office; European Council for Refugees and Exiles; European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights; International Catholic Migration Commission; International Commission of Jurists; International Organization for Migration; Jesuit Refugee Service; Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights; Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants; Red Cross EU Office; United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

This is the direct effect of increased surveillance and patrolling activities by the Greek authorities, which included the deployment of an additional 1800 officers along the Evros river at the beginning of August. In September, detections dropped even further from around 70 a week at the beginning of the month to below 30 in the second half. As crossing the border in the Evros region has become more difficult, the number of nationalities attempting to cross has also dropped, from over 60 to fewer than ten with the majority of migrants now coming from Iraq, Syria and Eritrea. As expected, some displacement effect has already taken place along the South Eastern border, with increasing numbers of migrants arriving mainly in the Greek Aegean Islands of Samos, Symi, Lesvos and Farmaconisi, as well as in Bulgaria. At the sea border with Turkey, weekly detection rates grew from around six in July to approximately 180 in August and September. In response to the growing migratory pressure in the Eastern Aegean Frontex has strengthen Joint Operation (JO) Poseidon Sea with additional air and maritime surveillance assets. At the land border between Turkey and Bulgaria the numbers of illegal border crossing have also risen since August and vary between 40 and 70 a week. Frontex JO Poseidon Land at this border is ongoing and supports the Bulgarian authorities with the screening and debriefing of irregular migrants. The number of Syrians arriving in an irregular way in Europe via Turkey has also been growing steadily since the beginning of the year with a dramatic increase in July when up to 800 Syrians were crossing the Greek-Turkish land border every week. Currently Syrians still constitute a significant percentage of all migrants arriving in Greece. For example since 1 August out of over 1300 migrants who arrived in the Aegean islands nearly 30% were Syrian nationals. Although increasing numbers of illegal border crossing are detected at the sea border and in Bulgaria the total number of migrants is still quite low in comparison with numbers detected in the Evros region before additional resources were deployed there. Since the beginning of the year, over 30 000 migrants have been detected in the Evros region alone. It is believed that a significant number of persons are still awaiting passage in Turkey. Those who are now reluctant to cross the Greek-Turkish land border are considered likely to try to cross other sections of EU external borders.

The aim of the Workshop is to bring together academic researchers, practitioners, and industry to: - discuss innovative solutions to current and future challenges in border control (including border surveillance), - present the latest results of research in the field of border control, - evaluate current applications, - identify next steps toward bringing solutions to fruition, and - disseminate information on ongoing border security-related research projects and initiatives. Possible topics of the papers are: 1. Detection, identification and authentication CHALLENGES: (A) An ever-increasing number of people coming to the EU poses a challenge of having less time for the entire process of person and document authentication and/verification, and efficiently detecting the \u201crisky\u201d ones, which should undergo a more thorough check; (B) Various types of insignificant-in-size maritime means are used by third-country nationals to enter into the EU in an irregular manner. Timely detection and classification of such means, in particular differentiating between suspicious and legitimate ones, poses a serious challenge. \u2022 Access control: authentication of documents, people and vehicles \u2022 Risk assessment of travelers (prior and upon arrival) \u2022 Deception detection \u2022 Modelling and optimization of the border control processing chain \u2022 Detection and risk-level classification of both large and small (fast) boats in maritime environment \u2022 Detection of persons attempting to enter illegally \u2022 Long range maritime positive identification of facilitators in poor optical conditions \u2022 Psycho-physiological and behavioural detection of risk \u2022 Small and wide land area intruder detection 2. Communication CHALLENGE: An increasing field-cooperation between Border Guard authorities of (neighbouring) countries is often hindered by non-compatible mobile secure communication networks that could be used to exchange data of various kind (videos, images, text) in a straightforward and efficient manner. \u2022 Efficient transfer of high volume of data, including video and images, from mobile (manned or unmanned) platforms to end users, and vice versa from operations centres to field assets \u2022 Ergonomic and user-friendly wireless mobile communication tools \u2022 Interconnection of secure communication networks of border guard authorities in neighbouring countries, including technical and legal aspects 3. Information sharing and interoperability CHALLENGE: An ever-growing requirement to exchange border security-related information of various kind at the EU-level poses a challenge in terms of: (a) making existing systems interoperable, (b) willingness to share information \u201cacross the sectors and borders\u201d, (c) having a common understanding of the content to be shared. \u2022 Platforms and systems for secure exchange of information \u2022 Collaboration across cultures, or the effects of culture and legal and organizational constraints on information sharing \u2022 Techniques to facilitate the exchange of information between non interoperable information systems \u2022 Integrated visa/immigration facilities control systems \u2022 Interoperability for information exchange: protocols, schemes, ontologies, topologies, semantic translations and common definitions of content 4. Information acquisition, fusion and utilisation CHALLENGE: The ever-growing amount of heterogeneous border security-related data stemming from different sources of varying reliability makes it difficult to efficiently process, analyse, fuse and convert it into actionable knowledge. \u2022 Real-time and near real-time text/data mining methods for processing vast amount of heterogeneous data \u2022 Techniques for data/information fusion (text, video, images, etc.) in real or close to real time \u2022 Trend analysis, pattern detection, cross-analysis of databases, optimisation analysis \u2022 Utilisation of new sources of information (e.g., open sources) for intelligence gathering and situational awareness (e.g., online news, social media, forums, deep web), including assessment of their quality, usefulness, reliability, and techniques to analyze them \u2022 Usability of new type of information in the border security-related decision making process \u2022 Intelligence-based risk assessment, threat classification and vulnerability assessment models 5. Technology impact, acceptance and integration CHALLENGE: Various new technologies with border control application potential are emerging, however, their integration into the border control processing chain poses administrative, technical, societal, privacy and human-machine optimisation issues. \u2022 Assessment of user acceptance \u2022 Data Protection, Fundamental rights and social impacts of use of technology at the border \u2022 Analysis of factors that may hinder introduction of new technologies (legal, organizational, societal) \u2022 Ergonomic impacts of use of technology at the border \u2022 Human-system optimization \u2022 Methods for diffusing and integrating new technology \u2022 Comparison of technology solutions (opportunity/risk analysis) \u2022 Modelling, simulation and training capabilities for border control (virtual environments) The research event will be co-located with the European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference (http://www.eisic.eu/) and will take place in Uppsala (Sweden) on 13-14 August 2013.

The Working Arrangement formalises existing cooperation between the two Agencies and will provide a framework for developing closer ties and mutual support in future. A number of EU policy documents, including the Stockholm Programme and a range of Council Conclusions and Commission Communications stress the importance of genuine and practical solidarity towards Member States facing particular pressures on their asylum and border management systems and underline the need for ever closer cooperation between the two Agencies. In particular, the Stockholm Programme stresses that it is essential that the activities of Frontex and EASO are coordinated when it comes to the reception of migrants at the EU\u2019s external borders and to the identification of those in need of international protection. According to the Working Arrangement, this coordination will be articulated in the following areas: \u2022 the Agencies\u2019 commitment to cooperate and coordinate their assessments and operational responses when assisting Member States; in particular in view of deployment of European Border Guard Teams and/or Asylum Support Teams; \u2022 the Agencies cooperate to develop methods to better identify those in need of international protection in the context of mixed migration flows; \u2022 the exchange of information on the profiles and compositions of expert pools as well as sharing best practices on the functioning of those pools; \u2022 exploring the possibilities for establishing common or mixed teams of border management and asylum experts; \u2022 exchanging best practices and methodologies on data collection and exchange, as well as on information-gathering and the production and sharing of statistics and analyses; \u2022 engagement in establishing and implementing specific mechanisms for joint Third Country Monitoring; \u2022 holding consultations on the development of training materials, developing training strategies and plans and exploring the possibilities for mutual participation in training activities. The two Agencies have already cooperated on an ad hoc basis across a wide range of activities encompassing Frontex and EASO operations, risk analysis, and training. Frontex regularly participates as an observer in EASO\u2019s Management Board and EASO is mandated in the revised Frontex regulation to be a permanent member of the Frontex Consultative Forum on Fundamental Rights. \u201cThis arrangement is a milestone for Frontex,\u201d said Frontex Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen. \u201cThis is an important document setting out a framework for future cooperation. The convergence between Frontex and EASO\u2019s missions makes them fully complementary when supporting the EU Member States from an operational and capacity-building perspective. I very much look forward to sharing our expertise and experience to further improve the raising and harmonising of European standards in these crucial areas,\u201d- he added. Dr Robert Visser, EASO's Executive Director held that \"EASO and Frontex are sister EU Agencies in the field of Justice and Home Affairs. Bilateral Cooperation between the two Agencies is already ongoing, at different levels, on a regular basis. This Working Arrangement enables for a more structured cooperation, in the field of international protection in the context of mixed migration flows. It structures and enhances this cooperation, enabling further joint activities both in the strategic and the operational field.

As international travel flows continue to rise, a key challenge lays in processing large volumes of travellers at the borders in a fast and secure manner. To maintain a top quality service in a cost effective way, governments and other stakeholders have started exploring innovative solutions where automation can help to facilitate travel. The deployment of ABC systems worldwide has expanded in recent times but has so far taken place in a disconnected manner. There is, however, a need for a coordinated exchange of experiences and lessons learnt on ABC-related issues, and for a comprehensive way forward towards future developments. The Conference on future developments of ABC co-organised by Frontex and the European Commission will constitute the first global initiative dedicated to ABC technologies and as such will serve as a platform for dialogue among all relevant stakeholders in this field. The aim is to bring together government officials from national border management and immigration authorities, Ministries of Interior, other law enforcement agencies responsible for border security, as well as policy makers, international organizations, standardisation bodies, airport authorities, academia, and private companies offering technologies and products related to ABC. The Conference will focus on the operational and practical challenges linked to the use of automation, the need for and the benefits of global interoperability and the ways in which this can be achieved and promoted. Furthermore, it will address the role of international and regional actors in promoting a harmonised and coherent approach and in shaping a future strategic vision for ABC.

The overall situation at the borders between Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, the Russian Federation and the neighbouring Member States (Poland, Slovakia, Finland, Norway, Lithuania, Romania, Latvia, Hungary and Estonia) did not change significantly in 2011 compared to 2010. The main challenges at these borders are linked to growing cross-border movements of regular travellers and illicit goods. Price differences and economic disparities in the border zones are the main drivers of smuggling activities. These remain the single largest threat to border security at the common borders between EU Member States and their eastern neighbors. Cigarettes and fuel continue to be smuggled mostly towards the EU, while smuggling of stolen vehicles, household goods (ranging from groceries to electronics) follows the opposite direction. The Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine remain markets with significant purchasing power and high demand for second-hand vehicles such as motorbikes, cars, heavy machinery (agricultural and construction machines) and lorries. The scale of irregular migration at the eastern borders is considered much smaller. Ukraine remains the main transit country for both Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and non-CIS irregular migrants (mostly Afghans and Somalis) aiming to reach the EU through its eastern borders. In addition, Ukraine is also the major route for migrants from the Caucasus region and Central Asian countries travelling towards (or from) the Russian Federation. It remains difficult to assess to what extent the two flows are linked. Importantly, detections of illegal stay on exit from the EU towards Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine more than doubled in 2011 (from around 3 300 to around 6 900). The most significant increases were reported by Poland and Hungary and were largely linked to Ukrainian nationals. This trend could be a further indication of worsening job opportunities within the traditional destination Member States for Ukrainian migrants, i.e. Italy, Germany and Spain.

The Frontex Executive Director, Ilkka Laitinen, noted that Frontex, from the very beginning of its work, took the respect of fundamental rights as a sine qua non in the performance of all its tasks, and particularly its joint operations and that, as its operations have become more complex and challenging in recent years, Frontex quickly recognised the need for clear Fundamental Rights and other guidelines for all those taking part in the activities it organises. While noting that responsibility for border control and respect of fundamental rights in its execution remains the exclusive competence of Member States, Frontex has made considerable effort to ensure that all its activities and staff not only respect but promote fundamental rights. \u2018For this reason we developed a Fundamental Rights strategy and related Action Plan, commissioned an external study on the Ethics of Border Security, and developed a binding Code of Conduct for staff and guest officers participating in our activities \u2013 all well before the amendment of the Frontex regulation\u2019 noted the Executive Director. \u2018These initiatives were consulted with key partners such as FRA, UNHCR and IOM on the basis of Working Arrangements that were signed early on in the development of our agency\u2019 \u2013 he continued. The amended Frontex Regulation, which entered into force at the end of 2011, mandates the creation of a number of further mechanisms to ensure the full respect of fundamental rights by the Agency. The most important among them are the creation of the position of independent Fundamental Rights Officer reporting directly to the Frontex Management Board, the Consultative Forum (composed of fundamental rights organisations and institutional partners) that will provide strategic Fundamental Rights advice to the Agency, and the development of a mechanism for suspending or terminating joint operations in the event of serious or persistent violations of Fundamental Rights. Frontex has been working hard on all these issues since late last year. The position of the Fundamental Rights Officer is currently advertised on the Frontex website and will close soon; invitations to join the Consultative Forum will be issued in the near future after a public call for interest; and a \u201cFrontex Standard Operating Procedure to ensure respect of Fundamental Rights in joint operations and pilot projects\u201d has already been drafted and will be approved shortly.

The event\u2019s main discussion this year was entitled \u201cGates or Bridges? The future of border control\u201d during which expert views on the most important issues of the times were shared by representatives of IOM, Europol, Frontex and researchers. As a forum for open discussion and exchange of ideas between the key players of migration and border management, the opportunities for airing expert knowledge is certainly unique. The maindebate was followed by four further panel discussions encompassing ethics in border control, information exchange, the Smart Borders initiative and multi-purpose joint maritime operations. Prior to the panel discussions, Frontex formally launched its revised Common Core Curriculum (CCC) for EU border guard training, which is now mandatory for implementation in all Member States, and awarded certificates of recognition to members of the working group responsible for developing the revised CCC.

From the beginning of June over 100 officers from 23 EU Member States will be deployed on the Polish-Ukrainian border to assist with border checks and border surveillance. At the same time border guards from several Member States and third countries will be working in key airports in Poland and the Ukraine. What is Frontex\u2019s role during Euro 2012? Big events such as Euro 2012 inevitably result in increased passenger flows across borders. Large numbers of travellers, in the case of Euro 2012 international football fans, pose a significant challenge to border control. The additional peculiarity of Euro 2012 is the fact that it takes place in two countries \u2013 Poland, belonging to the EU and Schengen Area, and Ukraine, which is not part of the Union and is outside Schengen space. Since the matches will take place in both countries, over one million people are expected to cross the borders of Poland and Ukraine at their airports and at land borders. This will take place in addition to the intense passenger traffic experienced daily at these borders. Why the additional assistance? Are these two countries unprepared to cope with border control? No. Frontex does not aim to replace border control of the Member States, but merely provides additional assistance to those EU countries that have external land, sea or air borders by pooling resources from other EU countries. Every major sports event requires additional resources and Eurocup 2012 is no exception. Frontex will provide Poland and Ukraine with additional officers and additional equipment for border checks at various border crossing points along Poland\u2019s land border, Polish and Ukrainian airports as well as at a number of international airports in various EU countries. Frontex will also deploy 130 officers to support Polish border guards at Border Crossing Points as well as to patrol the land, or \u201cgreen\u201d borders. Additional border control activities will also take place along land borders in other EU countries. So far, no further details can be released due to reasons of operational security. How many guest officers will be deployed in Poland and Ukraine within the framework of the Frontex operation? Frontex will coordinate the deployment of 130 officers coming from 23 EU countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland). What are the powers and competencies of guest officers? Can a guest officer refuse entry to Poland or Ukraine? Guest officers deployed by Frontex will come to support the Polish and Ukrainian border guards. Since Poland belongs to the EU and is a full member of Frontex, on its territory these officers will have the same powers as Polish border guards: they will patrol the Polish green border, stop any illegal activity, and perform second-line border checks. Guest Officers however cannot refuse entry to Poland \u2013 this task remains with Polish border guards as the decision to refuse entry can only be taken by a border guard from a host Member State. On Ukrainian territory however, these officers will have the status of \u2018observers\u2019 \u2013 they will mainly provide expert support and knowledge to Ukrainian officers, for example in the field of detection of forged documents. Frontex will also deploy officers from non-EU countries. What will their role be? Border guards from Ukraine, Russia and Croatia will be deployed as observers. This means they will not have the same rights as the guest officers, but they will support the Polish border authorities during examination of travel documents, assist local officers with their language skills, and facilitate information exchange between participating Member States and Ukraine, Russia and Croatia. For example, if a traveller from Croatia lands at Warsaw airport and the first-line check officer is unsure about the authenticity of his/her document, he can refer the traveller to a Croatian second-line officer to advise whether this document is authentic or false. Moreover, the Croatian officer will also be able to communicate with the traveller in his/her native language. Will foreign officers have the same rights as Polish border guards? Yes, the general rule is that guest officers of one EU country who are deployed in an operation in another country have the same rights as border guards in the host country. This means that for example a German, Austrian, Italian or French border guard coming to Poland during Joint Operation Euro 2012 will have the same rights as a Polish officer. It is important to stress however, that these officers will act under the command and control of the Polish Border Guard and that guest officers cannot refuse entry to Poland \u2013 this task always remains with national border guards. How does a Frontex-coordinated operational work in practical terms? When disproportionate pressure is identified at the border, or a hot-spot of irregular migration occurs, a decision may be taken to conduct a joint operation there. In such cases Frontex musters the resources of the Member States in terms of border officers and technical equipment and coordinates their deployment for a specified period and to a location where they are needed \u2014 this may be at a land or sea border, or at airports. During a joint operation EU Member States and Schengen-Associated countries (SACs) deploy the necessary resources and cooperate under shared leadership to carry out patrols and border checks according to a tightly defined operational plan. Such joint operations are carried out using specially trained officers under the authority of the hosting Member State. Although so-called Guest-Officers have the full rights of border guards, including the right to arrest suspects and carry a service weapon, they must be accompanied at all times by officers of the host country, who have a leading operational role on the territory of their country. The costs of joint operations are met or reimbursed by Frontex. In addition to border surveillance and border checks, operations may also use specialist interviewers to gather information on the smuggling networks behind irregular migration. The behaviour of officers serving in joint operations is subject to a Code of Conduct approved by the Frontex Management Board to ensure adherence to best practices, the highest professional standards and respect for fundamental rights.

The analysis shows that the irregular migration flows have further evolved during 2011 with the Slovenian-Croatian border being clearly the busiest EU external land border section. This situation was driven by three main factors: the extension of visa liberalisation for biometric passport holders from Albania and Bosnia Herzegovina; an increasing numbers of migrants at the Greek-Turkish borders, and an expansion in direct air links between the Western Balkans and Turkey.

The migrants, Tunisian and Somali nationals, used small and medium-sized rubber boats to reach Italy. This is a dramatic decrease in detections in comparison with the same period last year when over 5000 Tunisians had arrived on Lampedusa by mid-February. In 2011 this increased migratory flow triggered the launch of the Hermes operation, which began on 20 February 2011 and will continue until the end of 2012. Last year the Central Mediterranean route leading from Tunisia and Libya to the Italian Pelagic Islands was one the main entry routes to Europe for irregular migration. From the beginning of 2011 until the end of the year over 56 000 migrants arrived in Italy, the majority on the small island of Lampedusa located only about 125 nautical miles from the north coast of Africa. The departure points and nationalities of migrants changed significantly throughout the year, due to the volatile situation in North Africa. The migratory flow form Tunisia reached a peak in March 2011 when 191 boats arrived in a single month. By the end of the first quarter of 2011 the number of Tunisian migrants had reached 20 000. The situation changed dramatically at the beginning of April. With the outbreak of civil war in Libya the number of arrivals from Tunisia dropped but Lampedusa experienced a new migratory wave, this time from Libya. Between April and August over 25 000 migrants arrived. Originally from the Horn of Africa, sub-Saharan and Asian countries, they had been living and working in Libya when the conflict broke out. Unlike migrants from Tunisia, who were mostly young, single men, the boats from Libya carried families that included small children, pregnant women and the elderly. The numbers of arrivals from Libya dropped dramatically in August following the liberation of Tripoli by the National Transitional Council and from September until December only two more vessels arrived from Libya. Overall in 2011 some 400 boats reached Lampedusa, including 300 boats from Tunisia and over 100 from Libya. Migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean pay criminal networks to organise their trip to Europe. The fees charged by facilitators vary depending on the route the migrant is taking and range from several hundred to several thousand Euros. Arresting facilitators, who regularly put people on boats that put their lives at risk, is one of the goals of the operation. From the beginning of the operation until February 2012, 165 facilitators were arrested by the Italian authorities. Unseaworthy and overcrowded boats as well as difficult weather conditions on the open seas make a migrants\u2019s trip across the Mediterranean very dangerous. Last year vessels participating in the Hermes operation saved over 20 000 migrants at sea during search and rescue operations. Despite these dramatic efforts many migrants did not make it to their final destination. In 2011, according to UN sources, over 1500 migrants lost their lives in the Central Mediterranean, making it one of the highest death tolls for many years.

This is a significant decrease in comparison with the summer months, when detections stood at over 6 000 migrants. In the past couple of years crossings at this border seem to reflect a seasonal pattern with a decreasing trend beginning in November and continuing throughout the winter. Lower numbers of detections during the winter months are in part due to the harsh weather conditions in the region. Low temperatures, high water levels in the Evros river and flooding in the surrounding area make illegal border crossing very dangerous, and for some fatal. In January alone three migrants lost their lives at this border. In mid-January the corps of an unidentified Asian man was found in a village near Orestiada. A week later a young Palestinian died in a local hospital after being rescued from an islet in the Evros. A few days later, the body of an African woman was found on the river bank. The apparent cause of death in all cases was hypothermia. Despite these and many other tragic incidents that have taken place at this border, people-smuggling networks continue to facilitate the arrival of irregular migrants. Intercepting and arresting facilitators is one of the goals of the Poseidon Land operation. In January alone 18 suspected facilitators were detained in the operational area. Last year some 130 facilitators were arrested in the Evros region. The border in the Evros region remains the main entry point into the EU for migrants from Asia. In January, the largest group of migrants who crossed into Greece came from Afghanistan, followed by the nationals of Pakistan and Bangladesh. Migrants from North Africa are the second largest group, Algerians and Moroccans being the most numerous. Throughout 2011, migratory pressure on the Greek-Turkish border remained high with over 55 000 detections by the end of the year. This was an increase of approximately 17% compared to 2010. JO Poseidon Land began in March 2011 as a continuation of the deployment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams (November 2010\u2013February 2011) and will continue during 2012.

Consistent with recent trends the majority of migrants entered the EU in a small number of hotspots such as land border between Greece and Turkey in the Evros region and the Italian island of Lampedusa in Central Mediterranean. Afghan nationals remain the top nationality and in Q3 2011 represented almost a quarter of all irregular migrants detected at the EU borders. Moreover, in Q3 2011 there was a sevenfold increase in the number of Pakistani nationals who now rank second. The intelligence gathered suggests that most of the migrants from Pakistan are young, educated men from the North Easter part of the country who were unemployed in their country. Most were headed to Germany, Belgium, Italy, UK and France. Another new trend is a tenfold increase, in comparison with Q3 in 2010, in the number of Nigerians, who were detected mostly in Italy. Eastern Mediterranean There were over 18 000 detections at the Greek \u2013Turkish border. Afghan nationals remain the most numerous group, amounting to over 46% of detections, followed by Pakistanis. Greece remains a transit country for most migrants who tend to move from there to other Member States. In Q3 increasing numbers of migrants were detected illegally re-entering Schengen from the Western Balkans (in particular from Serbia to Hungary and from Croatia to Slovenia), crossing the Ionian Sea to southern Italy and using false documents on intra-Schengen flights from Greece to other EU countries. Central Mediterranean The situation in the Central Mediterranean has been highly volatile throughout 2011. The number of detections on the Italian island of Lampedusa, which has been the main destination of migrants from the beginning of the year, dropped by half in comparison with the previous quarter but still amounted to over 12 000 arrivals. It is worth noting that since the National Transitional Council successfully gained control of Tripoli, the flows of migrants from Libya stopped abruptly at the beginning of August. Following the fall of the Khadafy\u2019s regime migrants came mostly from Tunisia and Egypt. Migrants from Tunisia remain the most significant nationality with 3370 detections, followed by some 3000 Nigerians. The growing number of Nigerians detected at the European borders suggests that Nigerian facilitation networks are becoming more sophisticated and the numbers of migrants are likely to increase. Western Mediterranean Spain experienced the highest level of detections in three years, and an increase of 60% compared to year ago, with over 3 500 detections of North African and sub-Saharan migrants. As a result, the Western Mediterranean is now the third largest point of entry into the EU. Other The number of applications for international protection increased significantly in Q3 and reached over 64 000 applications across the Member States. The largest number of applications was submitted in Italy by nationals of Nigeria, Ghana, Mali and Pakistan. Numbers of applications submitted by nationals of Pakistan and Afghanistan also increased in other Member States, including Germany and Austria.

Analysis of the available data indicate that smuggling of cigarettes, fuel as well as household goods remain the largest risk at the common borders between these countries.

At the same time, illegal border crossing, clandestine entry and refusals of entry all increased significantly against a year earlier, as did the number of asylum applications received by Member States. The flows were typified by two main routes \u2014 via the Greek-Turkish land border, which saw seasonally increased migratory pressure, and via the Central Mediterranean route from North Africa, particularly to the Italian mainland, Sicily and Malta. The main point of departure on this latter route was Libya from where many East African and sub-Saharan migrants were forced to migrate by the subsequently ousted regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Illegal entry via the EU external border as a whole reached a level not recorded since the third quarter of 2008 despite an offset effect of a reduction in Albanian irregular migration following new visa-free travel rules. The total number of irregular entries to the EU in Q2 2011 stood at over 40 000 \u2014 50% up on the same period a year earlier. Eastern Mediterranean route At the Greek land border with Turkey, detections rose to a level comparable with that of Q2 2010 \u2014 over 11 000 illegal entries \u2014 with Afghans previously resident in Iran representing the commonest profile. Consequently, the Iranian authorities\u2019 policies towards its estimated 3-million population of Afghan refugees are seen as a key push factor for short-term migratory trends. Additional regions of origin on this route were Asia (Pakistan), North Africa (Algeria, Morocco) and sub-Saharan Africa (Somalia, Congo). Greece remains a key entry point for people-smuggling networks with secondary movements most often detected in the Western Balkans, Slovenia and Hungary as well as at the maritime border with Italy and at a range of international European airports. Central Mediterranean route Following a surge of some 20 000 Tunisian nationals in Q1 2011, the second quarter saw a 75% reduction in volumes of Tunisian migrants due to an accelerated readmission agreement between Italy and Tunisia. Nonetheless, the overall number of detections on this route increased due to large numbers of inter alia Central African, Nigerian and Ghanaian nationals previously resident in Libya travelling by boat to Lampedusa, Sicily and Malta. Many of these migrants claimed to have been forcibly expelled from Libya by the then-ruling regime of Colonel Gaddafi. Since the effective fall of the Gaddafi regime, irregular migration from Libya has dropped dramatically, though the situation there remains unstable and difficult to predict. Others Circular migration between Albania and Greece was significantly affected by visa-free travel rules for Albanians. Although many are believed to still be migrating for work, the now-legal flow is predominantly via border crossing points (BCPs). Hence, there was a concurrent rise in refusals of entry for Albanians at BCPs. On the eastern border with Belarus, an increasing number of migrants were detected from Georgia; some 6 800 arrived in the EU via Belarus in the first six months of 2011.

For the first time since the beginning of data collection in 2008,detections of illegal border crossings in the first quarter of the year (Q1) exceeded those for the previous quarter. The shift, from the Greek-Turkish land border to the Italian sea border, specifically to Lampedusa and other Pelagic Islands forming part of the EU southern maritime border, was due to the influx of migrants, predominantly from Tunisia, in the wake of political upheavals in the North Africa region. Approximately 20 000 Tunisian migrants were detected in the Pelagic Islands during Q1 2011, making it also the first quarter in which the highest number of irregular migrants was reported by a Member State other than Greece. Tunisians also figured more prominently among apprehension for suspected people-smuggling (facilitation) than in previous quarters. Since the end of the reporting period (March 2011) the flow of Tunisians has reduced significantly, in part due to an accelerated repatriation agreement between the Italian and Tunisian governments in April though the flow was followed by asubsequent influx from Libya of primarily sub-Saharan migrants following civil unrest and NATO Operation Unified Protector in Libya. Despite the shift of emphasis away from Greece due to the exceptional circumstances in North Africa and the Middle East, the Greek land border with Turkey remains an area of key concern for irregular migration, representing more than half the EU total, when migration to Italy is discounted. Although detections of irregular migrants and facilitators fell by 60% on the previous quarter (Q4 2010) this reduction is seen as chiefly due to the deployment by Frontex of Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABITs) between November 2010 and March 2011, and seasonal factors. With both those elements absent in the subsequent reporting period (April-June 2011), this land border is considered one of high migratory pressure with detections expected to increase in the short term. Available data also suggest that Turkey remains the main transit country for irregular migrants seeking to enter the EU by both land and air. Other main points of the FRAN Quarterly for January-March 2011 include: - Somalian nationals were detected in much lower numbers at the Greek-Turkish land border than in theprevious quarter, but increasingly in Malta, at the Slovakia-Ukraine land border and overstaying in Greece. - Circular migration by Albanian nationals, which was previously a prominent feature of irregular crossing figures at the EU external borders, fell significantly due to visa liberalisation measures for biometric passport holders as from December 2010. However in Q1 2011 they Albanian nationals were increasingly refused entry at border crossing points (BCPs). - For the first time more Albanians were refused than any other nationality, nearly all in connection with alerts in the Schengen Information System. - Possibly related to countermeasures taken by the Serbian authorities to address the abuse of visa liberalisation, between Q4 2010 and Q1 2011, the peak of Serbian asylum applications declined by 50% at the EU level.

The report now highlights an issue, which we agree, is of great importance. We would like to recall that Frontex fully respects and strives for promoting Fundamental Rights in its border control operations which, however, do not include organisation of, and responsibility for, detention on the territory of the Member States, which remains their exclusive remit. Frontex has been expected to operate in an exceptional environment where an evaluation mechanism of the national migration management processes is missing. However, as we noted even before the beginning of the RABIT operation and have continued to stress ever since, there are practical measures, which can be undertaken to improve responses to such situations. There is a need for earlier and more complete involvement of other EU and International actors in planning and executing emergency responses in order to alleviate problems, including the overcrowding in detention centres which the apprehension of large numbers of irregular migrants is bound to create. Frontex was receiving signals of concern from national officers deployed to the region. The Agency has been extremely concerned with the conditions at the detention centres - a point which we raised on several occasions both with the Greek authorities and with the European Commission. Nevertheless, we continue to stress that at the practical level abandoning emergency support operations such as RABIT 2011 is neither responsible, nor does it do anything to help the situation of irregular migrants on the ground. 'With regard to the HRW recommendations, we will give them serious consideration \u2013 in fact, the content of this report will be discussed at the next Frontex Management Board meeting together with the action plan for our Fundamental Rights strategy\u2018 said Frontex Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen. \u2018I would however point out that most of the HRW recommendations are already included as provisions in the text of the new Frontex Regulation\u2019 \u2013 he added. These include, among others, the possibility for Frontex to co-command a joint operation together with a Member State hosting it, the possibility of suspending or cancelling an operation if serious violations of fundamental rights occur, the nomination of a fundamental rights officer as well as the creation of the Fundamental Rights Consultative body. Moreover, Frontex has already implemented a number of measures aiming at improving the respect of Fundamental Rights in the areas for which it is responsible, including the creation of the code of conduct for all those taking part in Frontex-coordinated operations, as well as the Fundamental Rights strategy, which will be guiding our future actions. This will be carried out in continuing the cooperation with Frontex partners, such as European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), European Asylum Support Office (EASO), UNHCR and IOM.

THB Facts and FiguresThe exact extent of THB globally is not known for sure and estimates vary widely though a conservative UN estimate puts the figure at around 2.5 million. Described by a UN working group on the subject, THB is described as modern slavery that traps more people today than in the entire 400 years of the transatlantic slave trade. Moreover, according to Blue Blindfold, a UK-based THB awareness and prevention campaign, THB is the third largest source of income for organised crime groups and growing even faster than trafficking in illegal arms and drugs.\u201cAccording to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), about 12.3 million people worldwide are in forced labour, bonded labour, forced child labour or sexual servitude at any given time. Other estimates range between 4 million and 27 million. According to US government-sponsored research, about 800,000 people are trafficked across national boundaries each year, about 80% of whom are women and girls and \u201cup to 50%\u201d are children.\u201d House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, The Trade in Human Beings: Human Trafficking in the UK, Sixth Report of Session 2008\u201309 Volume I Article 2 of the EC Directive on THB defines trafficking in human beings as:\u201cThe recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or reception of persons, including the exchange or transfer of control over those persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.\u201dAccording to a Frontex Risk Analysis report, Situational Overview on Trafficking in Human Beings, 6,991 potential victims of trafficking were reported by 27 countries in 2009, up 34% on the 2008 figure of 5,200 potential victims. Of the total, almost 25% of identified victims were men and 15% were minors. The types of trafficking were defined as follows: \u2022 The exploitation of the prostitution of others;\u2022 Other forms of sexual exploitation;\u2022 Forced labour or services;\u2022 Slavery or practices similar to slavery;\u2022 Servitude;\u2022 Exploitation for activities associated with begging or for unlawful activities; and\u2022 Removal of organs.

Regarding irregular migration, the sharp decrease reported in 2009 (of around a third on 2008) stabilised in 2010; Member States and Schengen Associated Countries reported a total of 104,049 detections of illegal border crossing at the sea and land external borders, a total almost identical to the 2009 figure of 104,599. By far the most dramatic change of 2010 occurred at the Greek borders with Turkey (land and sea), which recorded a 45% increase between 2009 and 2010. Here, detections of illegal border crossing soared on previous years as the dominant routes used by migrant smugglers continued to shift. The Greek-Turkish land border in particular saw massive increases in migratory pressure, peaking at around 350 irregular migrants a day predominantly crossing a 12.5-km section of land border in the Evros river region, mainly around the Greek city of Orestiada. In addition to triggering the first ever deployment of Frontex\u2019s rapid-response capability \u2014 Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABITs) \u2014 this phenomenon also set a new record for detections of illegal border crossings. Greek authorities reported a total of 47,706 detections at the land border with Turkey, which compares to previous annual peaks of 30,000 in the Canary Islands in 2006 and 31,300 on the Italian island of Lampedusa during 2008. Meanwhile, irregular migration via the West African, Western Mediterranean and Central Mediterranean routes continued to decrease, thus reducing the overall detection of irregular migration of West Africans, who were once the most commonly detected migrants on those routes. In terms of refusals of entry, Member States reported only a slight decrease (-4%), from 113,029 in 2009 to 108,500 in 2010. There was a wide degree of variance however between border type, with an increase of 2.2% reported at the land borders and a decrease of 11% reported at air borders. Consequently, and for the first time since data collection began at the EU level, the annual total for refusals of entry was higher at land borders than at air borders. Ukrainians continued to be the main nationality refused entry, mostly at the Ukrainian border with Poland, which is one of the busiest sections of the EU\u2019s external borders. Serbians became the second most frequently refused nationality with an increase of more than 80% following the visa liberalisation process in the Western Balkans. At the external air borders, Brazilians continued to be the nationality most often refused entry, despite the fact that these refusals declined by more than 20% compared to 2009. The number of detections of forged documents increased by 20% on the 2009 figure (from 7,872 to 9,439) though with passenger flows in the hundreds of millions, the absolute numbers represent only a tiny percentage of travellers. Spain was the Member State in which the highest number of cases of forged document use was reported. The number of cases of illegal stay (migrants entering legally and then overstaying their visas) decreased overall by 15% on 2009 \u2014 from 412,125 to 348,666. Over the coming year, irregular passenger flows across the external borders are expected to increase. This is due to increasing mobility globally as well as the possibility of visa-liberalisation procedures for the EU\u2019s eastern European partners and new agreements governing local border traffic along the eastern borders. These developments will in turn increase the workload of Member States\u2019 border-control authorities in preventing the use of legal channels for overstaying. In addition, Europe will host two major sporting events in 2012 \u2014 the Olympic Games in London and the UEFA Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine \u2014 both of which will be marked by substantial increases in external-border traffic. There may also be important changes in the external Schengen and EU borders in 2011 or 2012, with the possible entry of Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area and Croatia\u2019s possible accession to the EU.

In the first four weeks of deployment Joint Operation Poseidon Land sees decreasing numbers of arrivals across the land border with Turkey. In view of potential migratory flows from Libya operational area of JO Poseidon Sea, which covers the Greek islands in the Aegean sea, has been widened to include Crete. On Thursday, 24 March Romanian maritime surveillance vessel and a Portuguese plane were deployed to increase patrolling intensity in this region.Latest arrival figures from the Evros region show that migratory pressure on the Greek-Turkish land border remains lower than last year. From 1 January 2011 until 24 March 5281 migrants were detected, in comparison with 8054 arrivals just in November and December 2010. Until 24 March there were 1383 detections, which is a slight decrease in comparison with the previous two months (2266 detections in January and 1632 in February). The largest group of migrants who crossed the Greek border in March comes from Afghanistan (24%) followed by migrants from Pakistan (14%), and Bangladesh (12%).

The approved document sets out the objectives, legal and political context, operational implications and implementation plan for the strategy. The strategy was developed through a consultative process involving active input from Member States as well as from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA). Its endorsement represents a further important step in Frontex\u2019s ongoing efforts to formalise an emphasis on fundamental rights at every level of its activities. This is part of a gradual process rather than a sudden change of policy. Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen said: \u201cFundamental Rights and human dignity have always been at the heart of Frontex\u2019s values. They are a founding principle of the EU itself and enshrined in the Lisbon treaty. It gives me great personal satisfaction to see the Member States, via the Management Board, so clearly endorse that commitment.\u201d The Fundamental Rights Strategy reflects Frontex\u2019s firm commitment to the principle of respect for human dignity and represents the culmination of extensive past efforts in this field. It is intended to unify the wide range of initiatives both within the Agency itself and during Joint Operations by Member States. The strategy will complement an existing Code of Conduct for Frontex staff and operational personnel which was formally adopted by Ilkka Laitinen the previous week. It puts the Code of Conduct and other rights-related activities within a clearly defined context and is expected to be incorporated as an integral part of the Programme of Work for 2012. The Frontex Management Board is comprised of representatives of all the Member States and Schengen-Associated Countries involved in Frontex activities, as well as representatives of the European Commission. As such, the unanimous support of the Agency\u2019s strategy represents a formalised acceptance of the Member States\u2019 and Frontex\u2019s shared values. While Member States themselves remain responsible for Fundamental Rights at their own borders, during Joint Operations it was felt necessary to formalise and unify the approaches of different Member States. Active promotion of its provisions at the level of national, institutional and civil society actors remains a role for National Border Management Services, while Frontex will focus its efforts on the EU and international level. The new strategy will be elaborated into an Action Plan, which has been requested by the Management Board with a view to adopting it at the next meeting, scheduled for May 24.

The majority of migrants are young men but 52 women and more than 240 minors were also detected during Italian-led Hermes. At the time of writing the great majority of migrants who recently arrived in Lampedusa claimed to be of Tunisian nationality. In addition to one aircraft and two vessels already financed and coordinated by Frontex, one Dutch and one Portuguese plane have now arrived in Pantelleria and Sardinia respectively to assist the Italian authorities in strengthening their border control activities. \u201cWith this equipment and 20 experts currently working in the centres of Bari, Caltanisetta and Crotone, we have satisfied 100 percent the request the Italian authorities made to Frontex,\u201d Laitinen concluded.

Responding to needs identified by the EU and its Member States, they perform a variety of legal, technical and scientific tasks across a broad range of policy areas. Each agency is unique and fulfils an individual function. Together they provide information and advice, prepare and take decisions, oversee operations and support policymaking. While some develop know-how and expertise, others integrate different interest groups and facilitate dialogue at European and international level. Today the agencies represent a significant presence across the Member States, their location helping to bring the EU closer to its citizens. Entrusting the agencies with specific tasks has become an established part of the way in which the EU now conducts its business.

Joint Operation Agelaus 2010 was a one-month fact-finding exercise conducted at 42 airports across Europe, at 14 of which guest 30 guest officers were deployed from 17 Member States. Joint Operation Agelaus 2010 was conducted between November 10 and December 7, under the auspices of Pulsar programme. Its key objective was to increase awareness of the phenomenon of irregular migration involving children, in order for Member States to address the issues of people smuggling and trafficking in human beings (THB) at the EU external air borders with regard to under-18s. A longer-term aim was to develop pro-active policies and procedures to deal with irregular/illegal migration involving children arriving at EU airports and to provide the basis for a more flexible approach to tackling the facilitators and organised crime groups involved. For reasons of child welfare, the emphasis throughout the operation was on crime prevention rather than investigation of criminals, by ensuring that vulnerable children at risk of being trafficked into the EU were identified at the earliest possible juncture and appropriate steps taken. Other aims were to collect data for ongoing analysis by the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit into such factors as nationalities most at risk, most common modi operandi used, routes travelled and prices paid to facilitation networks. As a result of Agelaus 2010, a total of 175 cases of under-18s immigrating irregularly into the EU were detected (90 boys and 85 girls) \u2014 of which 143 were accompanied by adults and 32 were unaccompanied \u2014 and entry was refused to 161 children (131 accompanied, 30 unaccompanied). A total of 76minorsapplied for asylum either immediately or after being refused entry. In addition, two adults were charged by Dutch authorities with attempting to smuggle a seven-month-old child into the Netherlands through Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport. The top three (claimed) nationalities of asylum applicants were Afghani (23), Turkish (17), Iranian (5) and Iraqi (5). The top five airports for detections were Madrid (70), Frankfurt (36), Amsterdam (24), Rome Fiumicino (20) and Brussels (11). The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) acted as observers at three airports, for one week each, and advised the project team during the planning and preparation phases. The Member States whose officers participated in Agelaus 2010 were Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Norway, Romania, Slovenia and Spain.

Throughout the year 2010, October saw the maximum number of migrants apprehended (7607), with an average of 245 detections per day. Since the beginning of Operation RABIT 2010, a decreasing trend in the number of detections was observed compared to October: in November (4631) and December (3423) the average daily detection rate fell to 154 (- 37%) and 110 (-57%) respectively. In the first week of 2011 (data until January 8, 2011), a total of 686 persons were detected crossing the green border illegally. The average number of migrants apprehended per day decreased further to approximately 98. The approximately 200 guest officers and interpreters sent to Greece by Frontex are under the command and control of the Greek authorities and are mainly involved in patrolling the border and collecting information about the people-smuggling networks facilitating the arrival of the migrants. Since June 2, 2010, over 38,000 undocumented persons have been detected crossing the Greek-Turkish land border. The largest group (44%) comes from Afghanistan while the other most numerous nationalities are Algerian (16%), Pakistani (8, 5%), Somali (6%) and Iraqi nationals (4%). Last year 45 people lost their lives trying to cross the Evros River, or at sea in the area of Alexandroupolis: 26 within the operational area of Orestiada; four at the banks of the Evros and 15 at sea in the vicinity of Alexandroupolis. In the first week of January alone four bodies were found in the area - all young males who had died of hypothermia. \u201cThese people were put on rubber boats or told to swim or cross the freezing cold river by the facilitators,\u201d said Frontex Deputy Executive Director Gil Arias Fernandez. \u201cIn fact, an important target of our operation are the criminal facilitation networks who are behind these arrivals.\u201d Since the start of Operation RABIT 2010, some 22 facilitators have been arrested, from \u2014 Turkey (9), Afghanistan (4) Bulgaria (4) Palestine (3), Syria (1) and Georgia (1).

The increase in detections of illegal border-crossing at the EU level is almost exclusively the result of increased pressure in Greece, where around four-fifths of all detections in the EU were reported. This unprecedented peak in illegal border-crossings at the Greek land border with Turkey is the result of a shift from the sea to the land border with Turkey, plus a large increase in the absolute number of migrants of many different nationalities using Turkey as an entry point to illegally enter the EU.

The analysis, conducted in response to a request by the European Commission, was intended to identify the extent and nature of the phenomenon, the profile of groups most at risk, the \u2018pull\u2019 and \u2018push\u2019 factors involved and the Member States most concerned, as well as providing a medium-term forecast of trends and offering recommendations for action. The Report Unaccompanied Minors in the Migration Process identifies some key trends, profiles and modi operandi in this increasingly visible and sensitive group. Unaccompanied minors are usually not detected at the EU external border but discovered to be unaccompanied at their final destination, often when they apply for asylum. Unaccompanied minors represent a particularly vulnerable group that are open to sexual, economic or criminal exploitation, including the removal of organs and as such constitute a population which should be more efficiently protected, the report finds. Though criminal networks are heavily involved in human trafficking and people-smuggling into the EU, among the exploiters taking advantage of children are sometimes their own relatives. In some cases, even family reunification may be initiated under false pretences and may end in domestic servitude or other forms of forced labour, including prostitution or crime. The main trends in the field are summarised below. The Victims Perhaps the most revealing trend is that although the numbers of unaccompanied minors irregularly entering the EU appear to have fallen in absolute terms (in line with the general reduction in migration at European and global levels) the proportion of minors involved seems to be increasing. For example, in 2008 approximately 15,700 unaccompanied minors claimed asylum in the EU. By July 2009 that figure already amounted to 8,500, despite a decrease in overall immigration figures. Furthermore, the soaring flow of unaccompanied minors from Afghanistan claiming asylum is a growing source of concern. In 2009 unaccompanied minors of Afghani origin remained in the top five, followed by Somali, Iraqi, Nigerian and Eritrean nationals. Overall, Afghani and Somali minors were identified as not only the largest groups, but also those considered most likely to grow in the medium term. Youngsters entering the EU irregularly from these countries are typically 16 to 17 years of age. The majority are male, as is the case with all migrant minor groups, with the exception of Nigerian nationals. Afghani minors tend to favour the Eastern Mediterranean land or sea route to Greece via turkey, as do Iraqis and Iranians. It should be noted, however, that since the data-collection period for the study, the Turkey-Greece land route has become dominant among irregular migrants as a whole. Even unaccompanied minors from the Horn of Africa have shifted from their traditional Central Mediterranean route towards Greece, and once there, try to elude the detection and identification process and reach their final destination. Unaccompanied minors from Nigeria, mostly female (aged 15-17 on average), are typically trafficked by air to the EU, boarding planes with facilitators and bearing genuine travel documents provided by local authorities, often through corruption. These documents are then handed to facilitators during the flight. On arrival they immediately apply for asylum as the only way to cross the border without valid travel documentation. Having been housed in reception facilities, these minors often call a pre-agreed contact number and disappear from care, from where they are taken to their place of employment, which usually implies prostitution (the British Asylum Screening Unit estimated that 60% of unaccompanied minors accommodated in social care centres go missing and are never found again). Nigerian organised crime groups run a highly professional human trafficking business based on travel documentation that provides false identity. Victims often also sign a voodoo pact before signing a USD 50,000 debt recognition. Somalian unaccompanied minors, who are exempt from the Dublin II regulation as \u201cvulnerable persons\u201d are often the first family member to arrive in the host country. The strong family ties and clan culture in Somalia then make family reunification a likely outcome. Minors from the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Brazil also often travel by air using false documentation or/and false pretences as organised groups, students or for reasons of family reunification. Chinese minors are often engaged in forced labour as well as in the sex trade. Member States Most Affected Sweden is the most popular EU destination country for unaccompanied minors claiming asylum, experiencing an increase of 49% over the past two years (2008 and 2009). In particular, Somali, Afghani and Russian nationals are growing sharply in the figures, whereas the number of Iraqi minors claiming asylum has decreased. A Norwegian study of EURODAC (European fingerprint database) records established that 75% of young Afghanis claiming asylum there entered through Greece. The Netherlands is sometimes chosen to clear the minors\u2019 administrative situation by claiming asylum in order to obtain a certificate with asylum applicant's status. Some 90% of asylum applications in the Netherlands during the data-collection period were made inland, mostly at Amsterdam\u2019s Schipol airport, where the applicants claimed to have just arrived and crossed the border crossing point (BCP) unnoticed. Other European countries are also affected by nationalities using air routes such as Chinese and Indian nationals targeting the UK. Outlook In line with the global downward trend of irregular migration, a drop in asylum figures for unaccompanied minors arriving in the EU is possible in the medium-term. However, two countries of origin will continue to stand out: - Afghanistan remains highly unstable with little hope of peace in the foreseeable future. International governmental and non-governmental organisations describe the economic and political situation there as deteriorating. This is expected to continue to provide a strong push factor for migration, both regular and irregular. - Somalia has seen a flow of 1.5 million internally displaced people and 561,154 refugees to neighbouring countries, many accommodated in appalling conditions. In addition, expected reinforcements of European legislation concerning minors from 16 to 18 may lead facilitators and families increasingly to start sending younger minors Important Note Unaccompanied Minors in the Migration Process was compiled on the basis of data provided by Member States in the form of replies to a CIREFI (Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Borders and Migration) questionnaire complemented by statistics from the European Migration Network (EMN). Additional data was provided by European Agencies (Europol and the Fundamental Rights Agency), international organisations such as the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD), International Organisation for Migration (IOM), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and non-governmental organizations (Payoke). Intelligence from Frontex-coordinated joint operations was also used. The data analysed covered the whole of 2008 and the first half of 2009. It is important to note that due to different procedures and definitions in different Member States, as well as some information being unattainable, the quality of available statistics was by no means definitive and as such final data are approximate.\u00a0 Files available for download Unaccompanied Minors Public () ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/frontex-releases-report-on-unaccompanied-minors-in-european-migration-KuQSlC"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0565", "date": "2010-11-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "FRAN Quarterly | Q02 2010", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus FRAN Quarterly | Q02 2010 2010-11-18 Frontex Risk Analysis Netwrork (FRAN) report provides a regular overview of illegal migration at the EU external borders.

The vast majority of the detected undocumented persons crossing the border have paid significant amounts of money to facilitators to assist with their journey to Europe\u201d said Gil Arias Fernandez. \u201cFacilitators lure these desperate people with the promise of an easy crossing and a better life, and charge up to USD 7,500 for a trip from Afghanistan. This is not always the case. Tragically, since the beginning of the year 41 people lost their lives trying to cross the Evros river or the sea in the area of Alexandropouli, many more die as a result of the dangerous forms of transport used by unscrupulous smugglers, others still end up victims of trafficking for the sex trade or in forced labour\u2019 \u2013 he added. Since 2 June, over 33,000 irregular migrants have been detected crossing the Greek-Turkish land border. The largest group (47%) come from Afghanistan. The next largest groups were from Algeria (17%), Pakistan (8%), Somalia (7%) and Iraq (5%). Only a few of those detected consider Greece as their final destination \u2013 the vast majority intend to move on to other European countries \u2013 with the UK, France, Germany or Italy being the main destinations.

Three distinct trends are apparent from the analysis. In terms of size, the greatest irregular migration flow is of Albanians from Albania (and Kosovo) to EU Member States. This is for the most part economically driven, circular in character and focuses mainly on the low-skilled, low-wage and informal sectors of the economy, with a strong seasonal character. Albanian irregular migration affects mostly Greece and Italy, with the Albania-Greece land border accounting for nearly 95% of the regional total irregular migratory pressure in the first quarter of 2010, up from 90% in 2009. The second noticeable trend is of onward movement of irregular migrants transiting via the Greek-Turkish border. This is typically towards Hungary and is composed of migrants from southern Asia, the Middle-East and Africa. Roughly a third of all irregular migrants passing through Greece have opted for the Balkan land route via the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia. The reasons for this choice seem to be its accessibility, affordability and relatively low risk. The third flow is much smaller and consists largely of Turkish nationals arriving in the Western Balkans by air as legal travellers and then moving on to the EU either clandestinely, through the use of false documents, or across land borders.

These lows continue a general decreasing trend already noticeable in 2009 and are attributed to reduced employment opportunities for irregular immigrants in the EU, combined with stricter migration and asylum policies in Member States and more effective co-operation with key countries of origin. At approximately 14,200, detections of illegal external border crossings in the first three months of 2010 were down 36% on the fourth quarter of 2009 and 39% on the same period a year earlier. While detections at the Spanish and Italian sea borders became negligible, detections at the dominant Eastern Aegean Sea border between Greece and Turkey also fell by more than 60% to just under 2,300. Within this overall decreasing trend, a new pattern also emerged: Detections at the Greek-Turkish land border were for the first time greater than those at the countries\u2019 sea border. Across the EU as a whole, detections of irregular immigrants at sea borders between January and March 2010 were less than one-tenth of the peak level (for the third quarter of 2008) when roughly 33,600 detections were reported. On the Central Mediterranean route, Member States reported only 150 detections of illegal border-crossing, compared to 5,200 detections in the first quarter of 2009, and 1,500 in the fourth quarter of 2009. This reduction is due to a bilateral agreement between the Italian and Libyan authorities implemented in May 2009. The number of detections along the Western Mediterranean sea route also reached a record low with only 500 irregular immigrants detected heading towards the southern Spanish coasts (almost 72% down on the fourth quarter of 2009 and almost 82% on the first quarter of 2009). On the West African route via the Canary Islands\u2014once the main transit route for irregular immigrants into the EU\u2014the number of arrivals also reached a record low, with only five detections over the first three months of 2010, in contrast to 31,700 detections in 2006, when Frontex operations started in that area.

This represents an unprecedented high for the FRAN data on detections of facilitators. The vast majority of facilitators were detected in Italy, France, Greece and Spain, representing more than 85% of all cases. Within this trend, Italy\u2019s tally of detections was up by almost 75% to more than 1,000, while France also noted a record number of facilitator interceptions (464). Another clear trend is that in most of these countries, it is mainly domestic nationals that provide facilitation.

This will be the first of offices that are supposed to provide regionally-based support for Frontex coordinated activities. The Management Board decided to choose the Eastern Mediterranean region for a pilot project. If the pilot project proves to be successful the concept will be implemented also in other regions such as: the Western Mediterranean, the Western Balkan and the Black Sea, and the Eastern land borders including the Baltic Sea. The establishment of Frontex Operational Offices (FOO) is a result of the debate on the improvement of Frontex operational capacity. New offices will strengthen Frontex role as a coordinator in the joint operations, enhance situational awareness in the region and reinforce its contribution to increase and harmonise border management standards across the external borders of the EU, according to Ilkka Laitinen, Frontex Executive Director. The core responsibilities will remain in Frontex Headquarters while the FOO will cater specific operational and practical needs of Member States, with the aim to increase the effectiveness of joint operations and efficient use of funds. Laitinen underlines that decision taken by the Management Board supports the possible enhancement of Frontex mandate highlighted already in the Stockholm Programme. \u201cThe increased regional presence will serve to match increasing reporting obligations on joint operations and enhance inter-agency co-operation with agencies such as Europol or European Asylum Support Office\u201d he says. \u201cI can even say this decision anticipates potential enlargement of the EU and Schengen zone.

The main objective of the Joint Operation HERA 2008 is to tackle illegal migration flows coming from West Africa countries heading to Canary Islands. The main objective of the Joint Operation NAUTILUS 2008 is to reinforce border control activities in Central Mediterranean and control illegal migration flows coming from North Africa countries heading to Malta and in Italy. The figures provided are gathered on a weekly basis and should be treated as raw (primary) data. For this reason, the final statistics may differ from the totals shown here, increasing every week during the course of each operation. For example, some of the persons that initially are included in the figures related to migrants can later be categorised as facilitators based on investigation results. Due to the high public interest in these Joint Operations the raw data will be published on Frontex website every Tuesday. Explanation about the Categories of Statistical Data The statistics published on this website are described below: Total Number of Arrivals This category includes persons that have reached the coast of the Member State, in which the Joint Operation takes place, on board of boats departing from Africa. i. JO HERA 2008 - Spain (Canary Islands); ii. JO NAUTILUS 2008 - Malta and Italian islands of Lampedusa and Sicily. This is a general category covering all arrivals without making a breakdown of sub-categories such as economical migrants. This category includes both persons that have been intercepted in the Member State\u2019s territory and those intercepted at sea by the assets deployed in the framework of Frontex coordinated Joint Operation. Migrants Diverted back This category includes data related to Joint Operation HERA 2008 only. Persons that were intercepted during Joint Operation HERA 2008 at sea who have either been convinced to turn back to safety or have been escorted back to the closest shore (Senegal or Mauritania). Spain concluded agreements with Mauritania and Senegal which allow diverting of would-be immigrants\u2019 boats back to their points of departure from a certain distance of the African coast line described in the agreements that Spain has between Mauritania and Senegal. A Mauritanian or Senegalese law enforcement officer is always present on board of deployed Member States\u2019 assets and is always responsible for the diversion. Facilitators Arrested This category includes the total number of persons that have been arrested by law enforcement authorities with charges of smuggling of human beings or for other similar or related crimes according to the criminal law of a respective country. Interviews carried out by experts deployed by Frontex This category includes the number of interviews carried out by experts deployed by Frontex. These experts are sent to the Member States hosting a Joint Operation in order to help interviewing migrants that illegally crossed the border. The interviews aim at gathering information on facilitation networks and details of the journey of migrants that can help improving the effectiveness of the Joint Operation. The experts do not interview persons that have asked for asylum.

Training for our officers should be therefore the same in order to enable smooth cooperation during joint operations coordinated by Frontex\u201d. The curriculum has been developed with the support of over 40 experts from 21 countries and consultancy from universities and international organisations such as UNHCR, IOM or CPT (Committee for the Prevention of Torture). A harmonised approach to the curriculum development was ensured by transferring best practices and knowledge in border guarding from member states, involving the NGOs and consulting universities on pedagogical and education issues. The training of border guard officers based on the Common Core Curriculum guarantees common quality measurable standards comparable within all the EU member states and Schengen Associated Countries. As the Common Core Curriculum is structured into four pillars:\u00a0(i) general part, (ii) air border, (iii) land border and (iv)\u00a0sea border modules, which complie with different training systems. The Common Core Curriculum for EU Border Guard basic training is a successor of the first CCC for border guard training. Its development was launched on the basis of the Seville European Council decision of June 2002. The first CCC was ready for implementation in the EU member states and Schengen Associated Countries on 15 June 2004. The implementation into training systems was monitored and as a result it was recommended to update the CCC for border guard training. Thus the CCC for EU border guard basic training was developed in 2006-2007. In order to ensure the comparability of trainings and flexibility of implementation respecting national differences, the knowledge and skills which border guard officers gain during the basic training are described. Instead of quantity (e.g. number of lessons), quality is emphasised. During the development process up to the date and scientific principles were followed. The CCC is in line with European educational policies and respects the Copenhagen and Bologna processes. The implementation into national training systems as recommended in the Schengen Borders Code is supported by Frontex and European Commission.

The aim of the exercise is to test the new mechanism for deployment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams in real circumstances. Border Guards from 16 Member States are helping the Portuguese authorities to avert the illegal immigration threat from the fictional island of Central American Republic.\u00a0 The concept of Rapid Border Intervention Teams was introduced by the Regulation (EC) 863/2007 consisting in creation of a pool of experts from the Member States, trained by Frontex, that could be deployed in urgent and exceptional situations. This pool is composed of experts and expert teams skilled in particular aspects of border control and with specific geographically related knowledge.\u00a0 After having implemented all necessary legal regulations and procedures related to the functioning of Rapid Border Intervention Teams it was decided to deploy them in real circumstances of Porto Airport in advance of a first non-fictional request from a Member State. Main goals of this particular operation are: to test the new mechanism in real circumstances, to test the administrative procedures necessary for deployment within the time limits mentioned in the RABIT Regulation,\u00a0 to deal with operational challenges and open questions in advance of real mission, to further develop the management of RABITs within Frontex. Rapid Border Intervention Teams deployed to the Porto airport are carrying out regular border checks together with their Portuguese partners; the only difference is the fictional scenario developed by Frontex Headqarters.Officers participating in the exercise are experts in border checks, forged and falsified documents as well as in so called second line interviews of third country nationals. They come from law enforcement bodies of: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. ScenarioThe airport of Porto is being reached by a large number of citizens of the fictional island of Central American Republic (CAR), using high quality forged documents obtained from a forgery network operating in that country.From the beginning of October a new route has been established between CAR and Porto. CENTRAL AMERICAN WINGS airline introduced 2 daily flights from CAR to Porto. The airline uses Boeing 747 for every flight, which indicates a capacity of 450 passengers per flight.It is known that the bad economic situation in CAR had driven\u00a0 people to take the decision to leave the country. Due to the hard visa restrictions imposed by the EU, citizens of CAR started using high quality forged documents of European and visa-exempted American countries produced by criminal networks.The entry to the Schengen area via Porto is the only possible one for CAR citizens due to the lack of other flight connections between CAR and the EU.On 15th of October 2007 CENTRAL AMERICAN WINGS airline published an announcement stating that due to the enormous demand on flight tickets from CAR to Porto, CENTRAL AMERICAN WINGS intended to introduce two additional intercontinental daily flights starting from 5th of November 2007. The Portuguese authorities expect a huge influx of CAR citizens, who will try to enter the Schengen area by using forged or falsified documents. The Portuguese border guard service is not able to deploy officers to the Porto Airport, having required profile and experience.

Rabits are a very good instrument for providing support for a limited period of time in exceptional and urgent situations, the Regulation says, I would also add unforeseeable. The Regulation also says Rapid Border Intervention Teams are not intended to provide long-term assistance. The Member States have created this solution and will adopt it in the coming days.At the same time one can hear voices from Member States inviting Frontex to use Rabits immediately for stopping the flow of illegal migrants from Africa. These voices would also like Frontex to deploy as much equipment as possible to the region. Why? Because Frontex has 21 airplanes, 27 helicopters and 116 boats. That\u2019s the fact I cannot deny, we have them\u2026 on paper. The Centralised Record of Available Technical Equipment (CRATE) is only a record that will help us in better planning Frontex operations. CRATE is like an e-shop, you can watch it on your screen and decide what you need, then order it and pay for it. Frontex doesn\u2019t have any vessels itself and cannot afford deployment of a big number of units to a chosen region. These assets belong to the Member States and they are subject to their will to deploy them. And as for the financial point of view, if we deployed the equipment from CRATE at once the budget of Frontex would evaporate in two weeks' time.In the Regulation that will be adopted tomorrow Member States repeat the sentence that was already present in the Frontex Regulation: \u201cResponsibility for the control of the external borders lies with the Member States\u201d. It seems that the will of Member States is crystal clear. In the Regulation establishing Frontex Member States stated that the need for creating an integrated management of operational cooperation at the external borders of the EU cannot be sufficiently satisfied by the Member States and can be better approached at Community level by Frontex. Therefore, Frontex started the implementation of integrated border management fulfilling the duty given to it by the Member States. Last weeks I learned reading the press that Member States don\u2019t want Frontex to fulfil its tasks; Member States want Frontex to become a search and rescue body. Legal advisors could have some problems in explaining why a Community agency should take action in an area that is out of the mandate not only of the agency but also the European Union.The raison d\u2019\u00eatre of Frontex are not emergency operations but the consistent introduction of well planned regular patrols by Member States, in order to limit urgent missions and to integrate the management of borders in all its dimensions defined by the Member States. Doctors say that the best intensive care unit cannot replace prophylaxis; I would say that it applies also to borders. Frontex is not and never will be a panacea to problems of illegal migration. The agency with personnel of 82 people and a budget of \u20ac 35m cannot take over the duty of hundreds of thousands of border guards in the European Union. Maybe our activities in the Mediterranean do not seem sufficient for some people but we have to act in accordance with the legal mandate we have, and in the fixed financial frames we have, not to mention the human resources and the willingness of the Member States to act together. Summing up I would like to remind that Frontex activities are supplementary to those undertaken by the Member States. Frontex doesn\u2019t have any monopole on border protection and is not omnipotent. It is a coordinator of the operational cooperation in which the Member States show their volition. If some of our critics think it is not enough they should fix their eyes on decision takers, as Frontex only executes its duties described in the Regulation 2007/2004.

During their deployment at several border crossing points and along the green border of Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, the task of the guest officers was to enhance border control and to assist local authorities to identify false/falsified document used by the nationals of Moldova. Besides the hosting countries, participating Member States included Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom. As Frontex risk analysis had shown, one of the main nationalities in illegal border crossings in the eastern part of the European Union are Moldovans. Besides, an increase in this trend was expected with the accession of Romania to the EU and the resulting visa obligation for Moldovans to enter Romania. During the two-week operation taking place in April 2007 the presence of guest officers enhanced the control of the border, enabled sharing of expertise among officers from several Member States and also contributed to gathering of information for the purpose of further activities. The total of 109 illegal border crossings or attempts were detected. The operation also included deployment of carbon dioxide detectors provided by the United Kingdom, used for detection of people hidden in vehicles. The use of falsified EU travel documents and the route via Romania and Hungary to Schengen countries were identified by Frontex as for the most frequent modus operandi.

The EPN is a permanent regional border security concept that enables the synchronization of national measures of the Member States and their integration to joint European activities. It is based on Member States\u00b4 existing activities and on strengthening of cooperation and coordination at national and EU levels. This is the first attempt to apply a system solution for the surveillance of southern maritime borders of the EU. The implementation of the EPN will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the EPN will be established based on Member States\u2019 patrolling activities covering defined coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. These activities will be planned, coordinated and implemented through a system of a national contact point in each Member State, together with Frontex. From the operational point of view it will allow avoiding overlapping of those patrols and effective sharing of the operational information. Besides, the network will provide a cost effective solution as the Member States will safe some money spent these days for patrols in the same areas as the neighbouring countries. In the second phase, the EPN will be further developed by establishment of an appropriate organizational structure, National Coordination Centres (NCCs) and strengthening the cooperation and coordination among Member States involved in the network. This will ensure the permanent activities of the European Patrols Network covering also the open sea far away from the coast, planned and implemented by Frontex and Member States together. Besides, this organizational structure will also be used while conducting joint operations at the southern maritime borders, thus creating a system covering the whole length of this border. The integration of EPN into the European Surveillance System is foreseen as the next step. Background The Presidency Conclusions from the European Council of 15/16 December 2005 called on Frontex to launch a feasibility study on reinforcing monitoring and surveillance of the southern maritime border of the EU, namely in the Mediterranean Sea, and on a Mediterranean Coastal Patrols Network involving EU Member States and North African countries. This task has been fulfilled by the MEDSEA study. This study, which Frontex delivered in July 2006, gives the organizational structure and the way to exchange information ensuring the coordination of such operational activity in an EU approach. Two fundamental needs to achieve the coverage of the entire EU southern maritime borders have been defined, the first one is the operational cooperation and coordination between authorities and the second one is the coordinative EU approach. These fundamental needs constitute also the challenges, national sovereignty and framework on one hand and the shared responsibility to protect the common area of freedom, security and justice on the other hand. The same Council Conclusions contain the task to explore the technical feasibility of establishing a surveillance system covering the whole southern maritime border of the EU and the Mediterranean Sea. As a response to this, the BORTEC study was carried out by Frontex. The study presents the structure of a surveillance system covering the southern maritime borders as well as the open sea. The system would be fully based on existing surveillance activities which should be integrated into a European Surveillance System, not creating any new bodies or adding bureaucracy. The fact that one system would be in place, coordinated by one body, namely Frontex, would substantially contribute to the effectiveness of surveillance activities, to their high and uniform level as well as to effective use of resources. Once in place the system will play an essential role in saving lives at sea and tackling illegal immigration. Besides, it will be an important step within the promotion of Integrated Border Management.

During the two month operation, which started on 12 February, 585 migrants arrived to the islands, about one third of them were interviewed within the operation. Besides, the total of 1167 migrants were diverted back to their points of departure at ports at the West African coast, thus preventing them to risk their lives on the dangerous journey. The operation Hera III ran in two parallel parts. The first part was implemented by experts from Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Portugal that were deployed in the Canary Islands. Working together with Spanish authorities the experts were conducting interviews with illegal migrants. The aim of these interviews was to establish in what extend and how these crossings are being facilitated as well as to establish the identity of the migrants. Information gathered during the interviews enables national measures against facilitation of illegal migration as well as return of illegal migrants. Already during the course of the operation several facilitators could be arrested by Spanish authorities. The top nationalities established during the interviews, which covered about one third of all arrivals during the operational period, the top three nationalities were Senegal, Gambia and the Ivory Coast. The second focus of the operation was on joint patrols by aerial and naval means of several Member States. The aim of these patrols, carried out with Senegalese authorities, was to stop migrants from leaving the shores on the long sea journey and thus reducing the danger of losses of human lives.\u00a0 Two Spanish vessels and one helicopter, one aircraft and one vessel from Italy, one aircraft from Luxembourg and one aircraft from France participated in the joint patrols along the coast of West Africa. \u201cAs our risk analysis shows, the migration flow towards the Canary Islands will remain one of the mostly used routes of illegal migration to the European Union. Therefore this route will stay in our focus and sequels of Hera III will be launched throughout the year,\u201d Mr Laitinen adds. \u201cApart from the outcomes shown in figures, this operation was of great value thanks to the active involvement of West African partners and several Member States. I am also pleased to see increased national measures taken by Spain to deal with this situation\u201d, the Executive Director concludes. The surveillance of the external borders in the region is being constantly carried out by Spain and West African partners.

Ilkka Laitinen, the Executive Director of Frontex expressed his gratitude to the Member States saying: \u201cDevelopment of European Patrols Network being a key element of the European Surveillance System is a very important part of our efforts focused on proper management of external maritime borders. Last year we prepared two feasibility studies dealing with institutional and technical possibilities of the surveillance of the southern maritime border of the European Union. Just a few months later we start with the implementation - I think it shows how dedicated to the surveillance of Southern maritime borders we are and Member States are, as they will jointly manage EPN activities in the regions identified by Frontex\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Centralised Records of Available Technical Equipment (CRATE) being created by Frontex, include equipment for control and surveillance of external border belonging to Member States of the European Union, which they on voluntary basis and upon request from another Member States are willing to put at the disposal of that Member State for a temporary period. Having been created, the technical records enhance Frontex coordinated joint operations as they reduce the necessity of ad hoc requests for technical assets. \u201cThe number of assets offered so far by Members States is really satisfactory. We can only be happy having assets from 21 Members State, among them 21 fixed wing aircrafts, 27 helicopters, 116 vessels, mobile radar units and other special technical equipment. Of course we will welcome warmly any new assets; CRATE is open and should be treated as a living instrument. We haven\u2019t closed the record and we never will\u2026\u201d said Ilkka Laitinen, the Executive Director of Frontex. EPN - backgroundIn 2006 Frontex carried out two feasibility studies dealing with institutional and technical possibilities of the surveillance of the southern maritime border of the European Union. Apart from monitoring the current situation, the studies proposed possible solutions for the area. From the point of view of organizational structure and the way to exchange information a network of national contact points connected with Frontex has been suggested. From the technical point of view, the studies present a structure of a surveillance system covering the southern maritime borders as well as the open sea. The proposed system is based on existing surveillance activities and their updating to form the European Surveillance System. Once in place the system will play an essential role in saving lives at sea and tackling illegal immigration. While there are many steps to be taken by the Member States on the way to the proposed solution, Frontex is currently starting to implement one part of the structure, namely the European Patrols Network (EPN) at the southern maritime borders of the EU as a cooperation model for the open sea. The establishment of the EPN is based on Member States\u2019 existing patrolling activities covering the Mediterranean Sea and a part of the Atlantic Ocean by planning together with the Member States a permanent joint operation. \u00a0 ", "url": "https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/european-patrols-network-and-centralised-record-of-available-technical-equipment-to-be-presented-at-tomorrow-s-jha-council-O1bOgX"}, {"id": "FRONTEX_NEWS_0629", "date": "2007-04-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Recruitment Procedure 2007 - New Vacancy Notices", "text": " News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Recruitment Procedure 2007 - New Vacancy Notices 2007-04-24 With the publication of a set of vacancy notices for\u00a010\u00a0Contract Agent posts the third round of Frontex recruitment procedure in 2007 has just been launched.

France is one of the countries that made numerous offers for the so called CRATE, being Centralised Records of Available Technical Equipment for control and surveillance of external borders. The task to set up and keep these records is stipulated by Article 7 of the Regulation 2007/2004 establishing Frontex. Moreover, the Conclusions of the European Council of 14 -15 December 2006 invited Frontex to finalise the work on these records. The CRATE contains equipment belonging to Member States, which they, on a voluntary basis and upon a request from another Member State, are willing to put at the disposal of that Member State. These means will always be deployed temporarily. The necessity for using the equipment will follow from an analysis of operational needs and risks carried out by Frontex. So far, technical means needed for individual operations coordinated by Frontex were always offered by the Member States on an ad hoc basis, following a Frontex request. Once created, these records will facilitate the operations, enabling faster deployment and more extensive technical support. \u201cSo far, we have received offers for the CRATE from 17 Member States. They include 19 aircrafts, 24 helicopters, 107 vessels and a lot of other technical equipment for border control and surveillance, such as forgery detection kits, UV lights or heart beat detectors,\u201c Frontex Executive Director specified.\u00a0 \u201cThese are very satisfactory numbers, especially those coming from France and Italy. However, we still hope for more offers to be made in the near future.\u201d Technical equipment for control and surveillance is deployed in many Frontex operations at all parts of the external border, being it air, land or sea border. The added value of having the centralised records will be even strengthened by the establishment of the FJSTs (Frontex Joint Support Teams) and RABITs (Rapid Border Intervention Teams). Both these proposals foresee the creation of a pool of experts from the Member States, trained by Frontex, that could be deployed in joint operations, either in regular operations planned on the basis of Frontex risk analysis (FJSTs) or in urgent and exceptional situations (RABITs). This pool will be composed of experts and expert teams skilled in individual aspects of border control and with specific geographically related knowledge.

He stressed it was possible thanks to the positive response of the Member States, support of the European Commission and in particular the personal commitment of Vice-President Frattini as well as the support of the Polish Ministry of the Interior. Describing the role of Frontex, Mr Laitinen said that Frontex is an operational coordinator. \u201cResponsibility for the control of the external borders lies with the Member States. Frontex, acting at the EU level, can enhance and complement the national efforts of the Member States.\u201d Further on, the Executive Director specified three preconditions of effective functioning of Frontex. These are the \u201cthree pivotal points of one triangle: the finance, the human resources and the commitment and support of Member States to make it all work.\u201d Providing that these three are in place, Frontex can carry out its intelligence driven activities and can proactively respond to the key illegal immigration threats. Summing up his speech, Mr Laitinen expressed his view that Frontex has \u201ccome a long way in a short time. We are a modern, dynamic European Agency that has had to become operationally effective in record fast time. We have learned many lessons along the way, and I am sure there will be many more lessons to be learned. But I do believe we have set up effective structures\u201d, he concluded. The first key note speech was delivered by Polish Minister of the Interior, Mr Janusz Kaczmarek, on behalf of the hosting country. After mentioned the cooperation arrangement between Frontex and Poland, The Minister stress the importance of Frontex as a European coordinator. \u201cThe creation of Frontex was a turning point in the approach of the Community to the issue of cooperation between Member States in the field of the EU external borders protection.\u201d Mentioning some concrete operations, Minister Kaczmarek illustrated the opportunities offered by the existence of Frontex: \u201cAccording to experts\u2019 opinion, joint operations carried out by the Agency, such as FIFA 2006, Turin 2006 or Poseidon confirm that the role of the Agency in coordinating operational cooperation between Member States on the external borders of the EU constitutes a potential we should take advantage of.\u201d Minister Sch\u00e4uble stressed the importance of cooperation among the Member States. \u201cThe strong migratory pressure along the southern external borders last year clearly demonstrated to all of us that joint coordinated action at EU level is crucial to combat illegal migration effectively,\u201d he said. Minister Sch\u00e4uble supported the intensification of surveillance of Europe\u2019s external borders and appreciated the work of Frontex: \u201cWith its joint operations, the European border management agency Frontex has shown that it can effectively support Member States in coping with this task.\u201d Further on, Minister Sch\u00e4uble underlined that \u201cGermany is thoroughly committed to strengthening Frontex during its EU Council Presidency\u201d. Commissioner Frattini opened his speech by paying homage to Frontex and its staff. \u201cIn fact, when I refer to an effective and efficient EU agency, I always use the example of Frontex,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Also from the Commission\u2019s point of view the operational capacity of Frontex needed to be boosted. The necessity of the current rapid growth of Frontex has two reasons, being the growing emergencies brought by migration flows but also the \u201ccommon political commitment for making the best possible use of Frontex available resources\u201d, the Commissioner explained. At the moment the opening ceremony is being continued with an open debate with the topic \u201cSecuring the external borders of an expanding EU: Can Frontex make a difference?\u201d Photographs from the event can be downloaded in the News room/press kit area of the web page www.frontex.europa.eu after registration.

The MTM Dialogue comprises numerous participating countries from both Arab Partner States (APS) and European Partner States (EPS). The forum last met in Porto 13-14 November 2006 to present the results of the work carried out this year, which included a draft joint assessment by the three agencies, and to launch the follow-up project known as Towards a Comprehensive Response to Mixed Migration Flows.

Each one demonstrates in a different way what the EU has done in 2006 to promote economic and social well-being of EU citizens, how it has acted to protect the environment or how it is increasingly helping out in global hot spots. One of the 10 is tackling illegal immigration in Europe with significant contribution of Frontex : \u201cFor the first time, the EU coordinated two joint sea operations in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea, in an attempt to deal with illegal immigration. This was a very tangible expression of \u2018solidarity in action\u2019 among EU countries, helping each other with rescue equipment, staff and knowledge.\u00a0 The operations were coordinated by Frontex, the new EU agency that organises practical cooperation in questions of border control. The operations were not about building \u2018Fortress Europe\u2019. They were of a humanitarian character and were aimed at saving lives at sea, as well as reducing illegal immigration and combating trafficking in human beings, a crime from which only the traffickers benefit. Practical tasks form part of a wider EU approach to migration, in particular from Africa. This includes questions like possibilities for legal migration, whilst avoiding the \u2018brain drain\u2019 when educated citizens leave poorer countries. The idea is for the EU to provide support to give would-be immigrants the chance of a better future in their home country. The EU also helps refugees to get access to international protection more quickly and tailored to their needs. The EU is developing partnerships with countries of origin and transit in Africa to deal with these matters in a mutually beneficial way\u201d.

The first module of the operation, HERA I, started on 17 July with the deployment of three subsequent groups of experts from France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom in the Canary Islands. These experts were involved in identification of migrants that had arrived to the Canary Islands and establishment of their countries of origin. During the course of this operation the total of 18 987 of illegal immigrants landed in the Canary Islands (as of 10 December). In 100% cases the country of origin of these migrants could be established. This fact contributed to the number of returns of illegal migrants carried out by Spanish authorities with the total of 6076 returnees between June and October. Besides, information collected during interviews enabled to detain several facilitators mainly in Senegal. The second module, HERA II, was commenced on 11 August. Originally planned for 9 weeks, the operation was later prolonged. Following a request for participation sent by Frontex, three Member States offered their assets for the joint sea operation, being Italy (1 vessel, 1 aircraft), Portugal (1 vessel) and Finland (1 aircraft). Vessels and planes from these countries, together with Spanish technical means, patrolled the coastal areas of Senegal, Mauritania, Cape Verde and the Canary Islands. Based on their bilateral agreements with Spain, Senegal and Mauritania were also involved with their assets and staff. The main aim of this joint effort was to detect vessels setting off towards the Canary Islands and to divert them back to their point of departure thus reducing the number of lives lost at sea. During the course of the operation more than 3 500 migrants were stopped from this dangerous endeavour close to African coast. During the course of HERA II, which finished on 15 December, the flow of irregular migration has decreased drastically. One of the important factors enabling continuous enhanced patrolling during as well as after the operation was the strong involvement of Senegal and Mauritania with which Frontex seeks to enter into permanent partnership. At present the area continues to be patrolled by Spanish means with the active participation of Senegalese and Mauritanian authorities.

The lessons learnt will be taken into account in future operations\u201d, said Ilkka Laitinen, the Executive Director of Frontex. In accordance with Article 8 of Frontex Regulation, Malta requested Frontex support in a situation requiring increased technical and operational assistance. Two operations were prepared in the region. Within the first one, a group of experts dealing with identification of migrants started working in Malta on 1 August, including experts from the UK, Denmark, Hungary, Germany and Italy. The worked carried out by the experts in Malta substantially contributed to the number of successfully identified migrants and thus increased the possibility of their return to their countries of origin. Besides, a joint sea operation was conducted to tackle the migration flow in the Central Mediterranean region targeting Malta and Italy.

Further details about the continuation and the resources to be allocated will follow at later stage. \u00a0 During his visit to the ongoing HERA operations at the Canary Islands Mr Laitinen expressed his satisfaction with the course and the outcomes of the HERA I and HERA II projects. He discussed also the issue of reinforcing national border protection capacities in the region with Spanish authorities. During August and September about 11.000 illegal immigrants embarked for the Canary Islands. In the same period, about 2300 persons have been diverted at the Mauritanian and Senegalese coasts. \u00a0 The figures of October show a drastic decrease in the flow of illegal immigrants through the area covered by the operation. Only one cayuco carrying 52 persons has arrived in the Canary Islands, whereas 250 persons were diverted at the African coast. \u00a0 The Hera II operation is one of two modules provided by Frontex to assist the Spain in tackling the flow of illegal immigrants from Western Africa. \u00a0 The first module (HERA I), to which several members states offered their contribution, focuses on the identification of illegal migrants who arrived in the Canary Islands as well as on the establishment of their country of origin. The first group of experts from France, Portugal, Italy and Germany, who were deployed there for one month as from June, was revealed by a second group composed of experts from Italy, the United Kingdom, Portugal and Germany.
