9412,FRONTEX_NEWS_0539,2011-08-30,Warsaw to Host 5th EU Anti-Trafficking Day on 18 October," News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Warsaw to Host 5th EU Anti-Trafficking Day on 18 October 2011-08-30 Warsaw, August 30, 2011 — The EU’s fifth Anti-Trafficking day will be held in Warsaw on Tuesday, October 18, 2011. The event—subtitled “Together Against Trafficking in Human Beings”—will provide participants with a platform for the exchange of views on strengthening cooperation between EU Agencies and other stakeholders in addressing trafficking in human beings (THB). The centrepiece of the day’s agenda will be a debate between the directors of EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Agencies involved in the fight against trafficking in human beings, moderated by the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, under the title “EU Member States and Agencies jointly addressing THB and victim protection.” This year’s Anti-Trafficking Day will be the first since the publication in March this year of EU directive 2011/36/EU on prevention and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, which aims to create a coherent pan-European approach to the problem. It will also be the first since the establishment this year of the position of EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator and the European Asylum Office. In addition to the central debate, there will be three workshops dedicated to the themes of prevention of THB, protection of victims and the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators. Each workshop will be co-chaired by representatives of EU Agencies involved in the relevant aspect of the fight against THB. Frontex will co-chair the workshop on prevention together with CEPOL, the European Police College. For more information please email: EUATD2011@frontex.europa.eu EU Anti-Trafficking Day has been held on 18 October for the last five years, in the Member State holding the EU’s revolving presidency, currently Poland. The first Anti-Trafficking Day took place in 2007. This year’s event is jointly organised by the Polish EU Presidency, the European Commission, The EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator and seven EU Agencies: CEPOL, the EU Asylum Support Office (EASO), the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), Europol, Eurojust, the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) and Frontex. Representatives of Non-Governmental Organisations, international organisations and academia involved in the field will also take part. THB Facts and FiguresThe exact extent of THB globally is not known for sure and estimates vary widely though a conservative UN estimate puts the figure at around 2.5 million. Described by a UN working group on the subject, THB is described as modern slavery that traps more people today than in the entire 400 years of the transatlantic slave trade. Moreover, according to Blue Blindfold, a UK-based THB awareness and prevention campaign, THB is the third largest source of income for organised crime groups and growing even faster than trafficking in illegal arms and drugs.“According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), about 12.3 million people worldwide are in forced labour, bonded labour, forced child labour or sexual servitude at any given time. Other estimates range between 4 million and 27 million. According to US government-sponsored research, about 800,000 people are trafficked across national boundaries each year, about 80% of whom are women and girls and “up to 50%” are children.” House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, The Trade in Human Beings: Human Trafficking in the UK, Sixth Report of Session 2008–09 Volume I Article 2 of the EC Directive on THB defines trafficking in human beings as:“The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or reception of persons, including the exchange or transfer of control over those persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.”According to a Frontex Risk Analysis report, Situational Overview on Trafficking in Human Beings, 6,991 potential victims of trafficking were reported by 27 countries in 2009, up 34% on the 2008 figure of 5,200 potential victims. Of the total, almost 25% of identified victims were men and 15% were minors. The types of trafficking were defined as follows: • The exploitation of the prostitution of others;• Other forms of sexual exploitation;• Forced labour or services;• Slavery or practices similar to slavery;• Servitude;• Exploitation for activities associated with begging or for unlawful activities; and• Removal of organs. The traffickers’ roles were divided as follows: • Recruiter;• Kidnapper;• Seller;• Buyer;• Transporter;• Harbourer;• Receiver;• Exploiter;• Document/ID Facilitator; and• Other Files available for download Frontex Risk Analysis Situational Overview () "
9384,FRONTEX_NEWS_0511,2012-09-06,Consultative Forum on Fundamental Rights taking shape," News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Consultative Forum on Fundamental Rights taking shape 2012-09-06 A preparatory meeting of Frontex’s Consultative Forum on Fundamental Rights (CF) was held in Warsaw yesterday.Participants in the meeting discussed how the CF could assist Frontex in promoting the respect of fundamental rights in all its activities and what the working methods of the forum should be. The meeting gathered representatives of 15 organisations specialized in different aspects of human rights, but all having expertise in migration issues. Yesterday’s meeting was one of the last steps leading to a formal decision on setting up this consultative process with civil society and international organisations. The Management Board will approve the list of the CF members and the working methods at its session on the 27th of September. Once the formal decision is made, the Consultative Forum will be able to start its work. Its first plenary meeting is foreseen for October 2012. The establishment of the Consultative Forum is stipulated in the amended Frontex regulation that entered into force December 2011. The Consultative Forum has the task of assisting the Executive Director (ED) and the MB in fundamental rights matters and is to be consulted on the further development and implementation of the Frontex Fundamental Rights Strategy, Code of Conduct and Common Core Curriculum.

9135,FRONTEX_NEWS_0262,2017-09-13,Experts meet to tackle document fraud," News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Experts meet to tackle document fraud 2017-09-13 On 11 and 12 September, a kick-off meeting of the Horizontal Expert Working Group on Document Fraud, led by France and supported by Europol and Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, was held at Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. The meeting addressed the increasing problem of document fraud as a key element for all types of criminal activity, as well as terrorism. Europol’s Executive Director Rob Wainwright said: “In the last few years document fraud has become a major criminal problem in Europe, helping to drive new shifts in the scale and impact of migrant smuggling, fraud, terrorism and other security threats. Professional criminal syndicates are now part of the large-scale production, trading and distribution of often high-quality identity and other official documents. Europol is pleased to support this new initiative between the Member States of the EU and other partners to crack down on this problem.”“Document fraud at the European Union’s external borders can ultimately undermine its internal security. Frontex will do its utmost to support the Council initiative, also by providing the expertise gained in our operations. Right now, we have 74 specialised document experts deployed at Europe’s borders,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. Combatting document fraud, and targeting the organised crime groups involved in producing and providing fraudulent and false documents, is one of 10 priorities for fighting organised and serious international crime between 2018 and 2021, as set by the Council of the EU. The Council decided that this would be implemented as a cross-cutting priority, following Europol’s SOCTA and recommendations by COSI. According to Frontex, document fraud constitutes a serious problem on entry at the external borders of the EU.This is the first time an EU crime priority will not be implemented through a specific ‘Multi Annual Strategic Plan and Operational Action Plan’, but instead through a common strategic goal in all relevant operational plans covering other criminal areas. This should make it possible to tackle the phenomenon in the comprehensive way by police, border and coast guard, and customs experts. To streamline their work, the EU Council decided to create the Horizontal Expert Working Group on Document Fraud. The working group comprising Member States, Frontex and Europol experts, will provide support in fighting all types of document fraud, including travel and identity documents, ‘breeder’ documents (serving as a basis to obtain identification documents fraudulently), other types of ID fraud, administrative and official documents of any kind that are subject to fraud by organised crime groups. The meeting began with welcome speeches from the Executive Directors of Frontex, Europol and the French National Police, followed by presentations on the EU Policy Cycle, a situational picture of document fraud and existing initiatives. On the second day of the meeting, the work methodology was discussed among the members of the working group. Both Agencies appointed special Document Fraud Coordinators to facilitate the work of the group. The next meeting of the Horizontal Expert Working Group on Document Fraud will be held at the Frontex Headquarters in Warsaw.

9332,FRONTEX_NEWS_0459,2015-02-12,Migrants forced to board inflatable rafts at gunpoint," News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Migrants forced to board inflatable rafts at gunpoint 2015-02-12 Today the African migrants who survived the traumatic events off the coast of Libya told Frontex debriefing officers that smugglers who organised the operation forced them at gunpoint onto the inflatable rafts.The interviewed migrants were among the more than 400 people who boarded four dinghies on a beach near Tripoli on Saturday night and headed for Italy. The survivors told officials that the smugglers threatened to shoot on the spot anyone who refused to get into the four inflatable rafts.The Italian Coast Guard assisted by vessels participating in the Operation Triton rescued 105 people on one of the vessels on Monday, although 29 of them died on hypothermia. The Coast Guard later redirected two merchant vessels to rescue nine more survivors from the other rafts. The rest of the migrants likely perished in the treacherous winter sea.“These stories point to an awful crime. The criminals threatened the migrants with violence to board these flimsy rubber boats, knowing very well that the chances of their survival in such difficult weather conditions were slim,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. “In this terrifying tragedy one can only wonder whether for these criminal this was a terrible accident, or part of a deliberate strategy”- he concluded.The Triton operation deploys two offshore patrol vessels and seven patrol boats that monitor Italy’s territorial waters and nearby search and rescue waters, along with one helicopter and two aircraft in the Mediterranean. The two airplanes remain involved in the ongoing search operations for the missing African migrants led by the Italian Coast Guard. Frontex coordinates border surveillance operations at the external borders of the European Union. Its role is not to replace border control of national authorities, but to provide those EU countries that face an increased migratory pressure with additional technical assistance and border guards. When called upon by the relevant authorities, they take active part in search and rescue operations, as required by maritime law. "
9381,FRONTEX_NEWS_0508,2013-01-16,Call for papers “Workshop on Innovation in Border Control”," News Select section: News Release News Release Focus Call for papers “Workshop on Innovation in Border Control” 2013-01-16 SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 29 April 2013 The Workshop on Innovation in Border Control 2013 (WIBC 2013), co-organized by Frontex Research and Development Unit, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, and the National Center for Border Security and Immigration (BORDERS) of the University of Arizona, is soliciting both research and “industrial practice and experience” papers. The aim of the Workshop is to bring together academic researchers, practitioners, and industry to: - discuss innovative solutions to current and future challenges in border control (including border surveillance), - present the latest results of research in the field of border control, - evaluate current applications, - identify next steps toward bringing solutions to fruition, and - disseminate information on ongoing border security-related research projects and initiatives. Possible topics of the papers are: 1. Detection, identification and authentication CHALLENGES: (A) An ever-increasing number of people coming to the EU poses a challenge of having less time for the entire process of person and document authentication and/verification, and efficiently detecting the “risky” ones, which should undergo a more thorough check; (B) Various types of insignificant-in-size maritime means are used by third-country nationals to enter into the EU in an irregular manner. Timely detection and classification of such means, in particular differentiating between suspicious and legitimate ones, poses a serious challenge. • Access control: authentication of documents, people and vehicles • Risk assessment of travelers (prior and upon arrival) • Deception detection • Modelling and optimization of the border control processing chain • Detection and risk-level classification of both large and small (fast) boats in maritime environment • Detection of persons attempting to enter illegally • Long range maritime positive identification of facilitators in poor optical conditions • Psycho-physiological and behavioural detection of risk • Small and wide land area intruder detection 2. Communication CHALLENGE: An increasing field-cooperation between Border Guard authorities of (neighbouring) countries is often hindered by non-compatible mobile secure communication networks that could be used to exchange data of various kind (videos, images, text) in a straightforward and efficient manner. • Efficient transfer of high volume of data, including video and images, from mobile (manned or unmanned) platforms to end users, and vice versa from operations centres to field assets • Ergonomic and user-friendly wireless mobile communication tools • Interconnection of secure communication networks of border guard authorities in neighbouring countries, including technical and legal aspects 3. Information sharing and interoperability CHALLENGE: An ever-growing requirement to exchange border security-related information of various kind at the EU-level poses a challenge in terms of: (a) making existing systems interoperable, (b) willingness to share information “across the sectors and borders”, (c) having a common understanding of the content to be shared. • Platforms and systems for secure exchange of information • Collaboration across cultures, or the effects of culture and legal and organizational constraints on information sharing • Techniques to facilitate the exchange of information between non interoperable information systems • Integrated visa/immigration facilities control systems • Interoperability for information exchange: protocols, schemes, ontologies, topologies, semantic translations and common definitions of content 4. Information acquisition, fusion and utilisation CHALLENGE: The ever-growing amount of heterogeneous border security-related data stemming from different sources of varying reliability makes it difficult to efficiently process, analyse, fuse and convert it into actionable knowledge. • Real-time and near real-time text/data mining methods for processing vast amount of heterogeneous data • Techniques for data/information fusion (text, video, images, etc.) in real or close to real time • Trend analysis, pattern detection, cross-analysis of databases, optimisation analysis • Utilisation of new sources of information (e.g., open sources) for intelligence gathering and situational awareness (e.g., online news, social media, forums, deep web), including assessment of their quality, usefulness, reliability, and techniques to analyze them • Usability of new type of information in the border security-related decision making process • Intelligence-based risk assessment, threat classification and vulnerability assessment models 5. Technology impact, acceptance and integration CHALLENGE: Various new technologies with border control application potential are emerging, however, their integration into the border control processing chain poses administrative, technical, societal, privacy and human-machine optimisation issues. • Assessment of user acceptance • Data Protection, Fundamental rights and social impacts of use of technology at the border • Analysis of factors that may hinder introduction of new technologies (legal, organizational, societal) • Ergonomic impacts of use of technology at the border • Human-system optimization • Methods for diffusing and integrating new technology • Comparison of technology solutions (opportunity/risk analysis) • Modelling, simulation and training capabilities for border control (virtual environments) The research event will be co-located with the European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference (http://www.eisic.eu/) and will take place in Uppsala (Sweden) on 13-14 August 2013.

2992,EUROPOL_NEWS_0172,2020-11-04,Targeting child trafficking: 388 arrested across Europe,"Europol, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom coordinated a Europe-wide joint action day targeting child trafficking. The operation, also supported by Frontex, took place between 5 and 11 October 2020 and involved 12* countries.  A wide range of law enforcement authorities including police, immigration and border control agencies, transport police, social assistance and child protection services and labour inspectorates participated in the joint action. 388 arrests and 249 potential victims The actions led to 388 arrests, 19 additional suspects identified and 40 new investigations initiated. Overall, 249 potential victims of human trafficking were identified, 61 of which were confirmed to be minors and the ages of 107 victims have not yet been determined. The involved national authorities focused on border crossings and main transport hubs to identify potential victims and suspects of human trafficking. Each country adapted the activities according to the forms of child trafficking which were nationally prevalent.  5 380 officers checked: 59 071 people; 1 529 locations; 15 923 vehicles; 39 860 documents. Underreported crime affecting the most vulnerable Human traffickers target the most vulnerable groups and children are among them. Child trafficking remains, however, underreported. Minors are trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation. Criminals abuse children while forcing them to beg or commit crimes such as smuggling of illegal goods and petty crimes.  Within the EU, children are mostly trafficked by their relatives. These criminal organisations, connected through large clan networks, operate in several countries and move the children on a rotational basis. They abuse them in sexual exploitation, forced begging and forced criminality schemes. Trafficked minors from non-EU countries are also often victims of migrant smugglers collaborating with adults who accompany the children while pretending to be their relatives or legal guardians.  *Participating countries: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Germany, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom Europol coordinated the action days and facilitated the information exchange between the participating countries. Europol provided analytical and operational support 24/7 and facilitated the real-time exchange of communication between the participating authorities.   In 2010 the European Union set up a four-year Policy Cycle to ensure greater continuity in the fight against serious international and organised crime.In 2017 the Council of the EU decided to continue the EU Policy Cycle for the 2018 - 2021 period. It aims to tackle the most significant threats posed by organised and serious international crime to the EU. This is achieved by improving and strengthening cooperation between the relevant services of EU Member States, institutions and agencies, as well as non-EU countries and organisations, including the private sector where relevant. Trafficking in human beings is one of the priorities for the Policy Cycle.   "
3651,EUROPOL_NEWS_0832,2017-06-20,Worldwide Operation Dragon sees 52 countries teaming up to thwart organised crime,"Following the successful 2014 Archimedes, 2015 Blue Amber and 2016 Ciconia Alba operations, EU Member States, EU bodies1 and third partners2 have once again joined forces with Europol in this year’s Operation Dragon to counter organised crime networks involved in the priority crime areas3. Operation Dragon is the fourth series of joint action days (JADs) covered by the 2014 – 2017 EU Policy Cycle targeting serious international and organised crime. Operation Dragon focuses on key crime hot spots and key criminal infrastructures in the EU and beyond. Hundreds of law enforcement officers working on the ground receive live 24/7 operational support from a coordination centre located at Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. Here, liaison officers from the EU Member States and colleagues from other international partners coordinate the exchange of information and intelligence between national law enforcement authorities. Europol specialists and analysts provide support from the headquarters and also on the spot. Operation Dragon has already had a significant impact on the international criminal landscape. Within the context of the EU policy cycle priority ‘cybercrime – payment card fraud’, law enforcement officers from all over the world detained 153 individuals suspected of flying using airline tickets purchased with stolen, compromised or fake credit card details. Operational actions were carried out in 230 airports across the world. The multi-disciplinary approach of the operation enables law enforcement authorities to link together actions covering several different crime priorities and areas. This enhances the operational impact and ensures cost-effective cooperation between the law enforcement authorities involved. The Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI) of the Council of the EU has provided strategic guidance for the planning of the JADs and is monitoring their implementation.   ----- 1  European Commission, Eurojust, Frontex.2  Albania, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Philippines, Qatar, Serbia, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, United Arab Emirates, United States, Interpol, CCWP, MAOC.3  Facilitation of Illegal Immigration, Trafficking in Human Beings, Counterfeit goods, Excise and MTIC Fraud, Synthetic Drugs, Cocaine and Heroin, Cybercrime, Illicit Firearms Trafficking, Organised Property Crime.  "
3582,EUROPOL_NEWS_0763,2017-11-16,Europol hosts expert meeting on outlaw motorcycle gangs,"The number of outlaw motorcycle gang (OMCG) chapters in Europe still remains on a high and growing level. OMCGs are well organised groups that usually operate transnationally. Given the significant expansion of OMCGs and chapters in Europe over the last few years, Europol has built and improved its monitoring and analytical skills as well as the criminal intelligence capabilities, because of the risk of clashes and the impact on the general organised crime situation. Together with partners from the Member States and third parties, Europol sees the need for an international and cross-boarder approach, and closer cooperation for tackling all the challenges concerning OMCGs. To step up to the challenges of OMCG activities, Europol brought together 45 high-level representatives from law enforcement agencies from 20 EU Member States (MS), 5 third parties and international organisations at Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. This international and annual meeting of outlaw motorcycle gang experts took place on 9 and 10 November for the 22nd time. The aims and the objectives of the meeting were to exchange expertise and best practices for tackling the activities of OMCGs from a transnational perspective. Zoltán Nagy, Head of Unit of the European Serious Organised Crime Centre, said that “Europol will continue supporting the efforts of the EU MS and third countries in tackling OMCGs and street gangs, recognising their wide international dimension and the impact they have in drugs and weapons trafficking, violence applied in racketeering and extortion, money laundering, etc.”   Intensive expert information exchange In particular, conference participants had an intensive information exchange about the current situation and trends in different countries and the international overall monitoring of major biker events. Innovative investigative approaches towards the OMCGs were also discussed as well as the growth and expansion of street gangs and box clubs. The fruitful collaboration with all involved participants played a crucial role in developing strategies for this phenomenon. Learn more about Europol’s support Europol plays a key role in combatting the criminal activities of outlaw motorcycle gangs. To assist its partners more effectively, and to follow a multidisciplinary and horizontal approach, the project focuses on organised crime groups rather than just on the crimes committed by outlaw motorcycle gangs. The project does this by, for example: providing operational analysis support during live investigations; identifying the structures and members of these gangs; identifying new phenomena within this subculture and detecting new trends through strategic analysis; informing the public and law enforcement about threats; organising expert conferences and training courses throughout Europe;  providing high-level support to law enforcement management, and judicial and government authorities; supporting the Europol Platform for Gang Experts      "
3125,EUROPOL_NEWS_0305,2020-02-04,Eight arrested for smuggling migrants from Greece to Italy,"On 2 February 2020, a law enforcement operation supported by Europol saw the arrest of eight individuals suspected of smuggling migrants from Greece to Italy using sailing vessels. Operation Odyssey led by the Organised Crime Unit of the Hellenic Police (Ελληνική Αστυνομία), together with the Hellenic Coast Guard (Λιμενικό Σώμα-Ελληνική Ακτοφυλακή) and the British National Crime Agency (NCA) began in autumn 2019.  Four children among the victims On the day before the operation, the Hellenic Coast Guard detected a vessel with a group of migrants from the coast of Attica in Greece headed to Italy. The boat was stopped and two members of the criminal group were arrested, it was then when the investigators found 19 migrants on board, including four minors. At the same time, six more suspects were arrested in various areas of Attica.  It is believed that the highly structured organised crime group had been in operation since at least November 2019. The criminals bought vessels and identified migrants who wanted to travel to Italy, charging around €4 000 each.  On the action day, the following were confiscated:         a sailing vessel and a small boat;  maps and high-tech GPS navigators; digital storage means and mobile phones; €2 500 and various money transfer receipts; documents for purchasing vessels; two vehicles. Experts from Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre (EMSC), deployed to Greece, provided continuous operational assistance, tailored analytical support and cross-checking of operational information against Europol’s databases.  In 2010 the European Union set up a four-year Policy Cycle to ensure greater continuity in the fight against serious international and organised crime. In March 2017 the Council of the EU decided to continue the EU Policy Cycle for organised and serious international crime for the 2018 - 2021 period. This multiannual Policy Cycle aims to tackle the most significant threats posed by organised and serious international crime to the EU in a coherent and methodological manner. This is achieved by improving and strengthening cooperation between the relevant services of EU Member States, institutions and agencies, as well as non-EU countries and organisations, including the private sector where relevant. Facilitation of illegal immigration is one of the priorities for the Policy Cycle. "
3030,EUROPOL_NEWS_0210,2020-08-07,7 suspects arrested in Spain and France after 6 million of cigarettes seized,"On 22 July, Guardia Civil and customs officers raided in the Spanish town of Borjas Blancas an illegal tobacco factory producing 9,000 cigarettes per hour. 7 people were arrested in connection with these raids, including the criminal ringleader at his private residence in the town of Mataró, his accomplice in the town of La Junquera and 2 factory workers arrested at the scene, all of them Lithuanian and Polish nationals.  3 drivers were also arrested in earlier actions against this organised crime group. Code-named Operation KARUNA, this operation was led by the Spanish Civil Guard (Guardia Civil) and Tax Office (Agencia Tributaria), working together with the Lithuanian Customs Criminal Service (Muitinės Kriminalinė Tarnyba), the Polish Border Guard (Straż Graniczna) and the French Customs (Direction générale des douanes et droits indirects) with the full support of Europol. Close to one million cigarettes ready to be shipped were seized at the scene, alongside €72,640 in cash presumably resulting from the sale of the cigarettes. The illegal factory had the capacity to accommodate 14 workers who would work in shifts to maintain round-the-clock production.  This action day is the culmination of an operation initiated at the end of last year after Europol shared with the Spanish Guardia Civil intelligence about a transnational organised crime network operating in the region of Catalonia and illegally manufacturing large quantities of tobacco products that were then sold primarily in Spain and France. A number of actions have since taken place targeting the deliveries of tobacco products illegally manufactured by this criminal group. The first of these, conducted by the French Customs, resulted in the seizure of close to 5 million cigarettes, transported in a lorry which was entering the French territory. The driver, a Polish national, was arrested. In a similar action on 19 July, another lorry driving towards the French border was stopped at the Spanish town of Canfranc and 864 000 cigarettes were seized. The two Lithuanian drivers were arrested. Europol actively supported this investigation by facilitating the exchange of information between all involved parties and analysing the operational data to identify the main targets as well as by organising coordination meetings in a secure environment at the request of Spanish investigators. In 2010 the European Union set up a four-year Policy Cycle to ensure greater continuity in the fight against serious international and organised crime. In 2017 the Council of the EU decided to continue the EU Policy Cycle for the 2018 - 2021 period. It aims to tackle the most significant threats posed by organised and serious international crime to the EU. This is achieved by improving and strengthening cooperation between the relevant services of EU Member States, institutions and agencies, as well as non-EU countries and organisations, including the private sector where relevant. Excise fraud is one of the priorities for the Policy Cycle.    "

Among other activities, the participants were updated on recent attacks involving the use of home-made explosives (HME) and IEDs. They worked together on improving techniques to render safe improvised explosive devices, sharing their invaluable experience gained worldwide in three different continents. Specialists from the Polish Police showed their expertise and the delegates from the participating countries had the chance to work with the state of the art equipment of their Polish colleagues. This training was made possible through outstanding cooperation between the Polish Authorities and Europol, coupled with co–funding from the Commission (Directorate General of Home Affairs). The European Explosive Ordnance Disposal Network (EEODN) is one of the European Union’s priority policies in the fight against terrorism. Through the EEODN, Europol continues to enhance and develop knowledge in the field of explosives and chemical, biological, radiological/nuclear (CBRN) security, by facilitating the sharing of best practices among EU experts. The EEODN was established as requested in the EU Action Plan on Enhancing the Security of Explosives, and was approved by the EU JHA Ministers in April 2008. Since then, EOD and CBRN experts have met twice a year to discuss and understand the existing threats from the illicit use of explosives and CBRN agents. During this Conference, an important agreement was made in order to implement Action H38 of the EU CBRN Action Plan, by fully integrating the fight against the CBRN threat into the network goals, and creating two specialised working groups: one for Explosives and another for CBRN. Both working groups will continue exchanging their expertise and best practices under the common umbrella of the EEODN, which amended its protocol to reflect these changes."

The Forum discussed concrete operational actions in key areas related to migrant smuggling, including: illicit money flows and money laundering; the use of social media by smuggling networks; the links between migrant smuggling and other criminal activities such as trafficking in human beings and child exploitation, identity and document fraud, and patterns of travel facilitators. ”The criminal networks involved in migrant smuggling expand beyond EU borders, covering countries of origin, transit and destination,’’ said Wil van Gemert, Europol Deputy Director of Operations. “This is why the partnership between Europol and INTERPOL, based on mutual trust and close collaboration, is so important. This second edition of the Forum offers the perfect opportunity to create more synergies in the fight against migrant smuggling networks and strengthens global law enforcement cooperation, with a special focus on how to improve and plan joint operational activities.’’ Tim Morris, INTERPOL’s Executive Director of Police Services, said the Forum provided an important opportunity for INTERPOL and Europol to further combine their efforts against the diverse nature of people smuggling networks and their spread across international borders. “With people smuggling a global issue it is vital that we continue to streamline our efforts to identify, monitor and disrupt these criminal networks inside and outside of Europe. INTERPOL, as the world’s largest criminal police organisation, is in a unique position, in coordination with Europol and other regional stakeholders, to mobilise its analytical, operational and capacity building capabilities against these transnational criminal networks,” said Mr Morris. Mr Morris added that the European Migrant Smuggling Centre, which was launched during the Forum, would provide another platform for cooperation between the two organisations. Since the first joint Operational Forum held in Lyon in October 2015, Europol and INTERPOL have significantly reinforced their operational cooperation to ensure optimal investigative support to law enforcement agencies across source, transit and destination countries within their respective memberships. At this 2nd Europol and INTERPOL Operational Forum on Countering Migrant Smuggling Networks: The European Migrant Smuggling Centre (EMSC) at Europol was launched - an important step forward in the EU’s fight against migrant smuggling networks. Working closely with relevant EU partners, INTERPOL and third countries, the EMSC aims to strengthen Europol’s capacity to assist European Union Member States through enhanced information exchange, operational and strategic support. The Centre will focus on geographical criminal hotspots and will build a better capability across the European Union to fight people smuggling networks. Europol and INTERPOL presented a joint draft report on migrant smuggling networks affecting Europe, as agreed upon at the 1st Operational Forum in Lyon. The report provides an overview of the criminal networks behind migrant smuggling, their key hotspots and modi operandi, as well as the financial flows and assets of supporting networks. It provides an expert’s assessment on future threats and risks and sets a list of recommendations for future operational actions. The intelligence gaps identified and operational key areas to target were discussed during the meeting. INTERPOL informed participants of the Specialist Operational Network against Migrant Smuggling, comprising 86 experts from 71 source, transit and destination countries. Working closely with Europol and other partners, this specialist network aims to increase the real-time exchange of law enforcement information worldwide in order to more effectively investigate migrant smugglers and dismantle migrant smuggling networks. In addition, concrete operational actions will be further elaborated and implemented by law enforcement authorities of member countries with support from Europol and INTERPOL. Investigations taking into account links to other areas are planned to be launched within the framework of the EMPACT Joint Action Days 2016 under the EU Policy Cycle for serious and organised crime. This two-day meeting brought together around 200 experts from 70 source, transit and destination countries affected by irregular migration flows, as well as from international and regional organisations. #migrantsmuggling @Europol"

This coordinated action targeted criminal services misusing illegally obtained credit card credentials and advertising on the Internet the sale of fake plane tickets As a result of Operation Travel, 50 individuals, including 4 leaders of the organised crime group, were detained in the southern part of Romania. 16 house searches were executed, and a significant amount of digital evidence, computers, mobile phones, SIM cards, memory cards and documents were seized for further analysis. Active since 2013, the apprehended criminal organisation illegally obtained payment card information and other personal data from victims worldwide, and subsequently used this data to acquire high-value goods and services, including most frequently plane tickets, but also sports bets, electronic devices, jewellery, agricultural machinery and real estate. The proceeds from the online fraud were also used to facilitate other crimes on the national and international level. Internet-facilitated credit card fraud has resulted in substantial financial losses for the airline and payment sector, and has been proved to facilitate other forms of serious crime by providing means of transport and funds for organised crime groups. Europol's Deputy Director Operations Wil van Gemert said: ""This coordinated action is yet another excellent example of how the combined forces of European law enforcement agencies, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the private sector are capable of severely disrupting criminal syndicates who rely on the outdated assumption that they are beyond the reach of law in cyberspace. Multi-stakeholder cooperation is essential to prove these cybercriminals wrong, and support the airline industry in combating online fraudulent schemes."" Europol's European Cyber Crime Centre (EC3) assisted this operation by providing analytical support, facilitating exchange of information and evidence between the involved countries as well as assisting the final on-the-spot operation in Romania. "

On 21 July 2016, Europol deployed a Mobile Analysis Support Team to Austria and Hungary to support the local authorities in organising a joint action day against the network. Law enforcement officers arrested 6 individuals in Austria and one in Hungary. The group was composed of 25 members, the majority of them Russian nationals of Chechen origin residing in Austria. The key facilitator, a 44 year old Syrian national, was recruiting drivers in Austria and deploying them to Hungary. He was in permanent contact with the recruiters who had been tasked to recruit migrants in refugee camps in Hungary. The smuggled migrants were of Afghan, Iranian, Iraqi and Syrian nationality. They were seeking asylum and left the reception centres without permission. The smugglers were charging around EUR 300 per person for a trip from Hungary to Vienna and EUR 700 to 800 from Hungary to Germany. The crime network is suspected to have smuggled over 200 individuals. In order to avoid being detected by the police, the suspects used alternative routes e.g. entering into Austria through Slovakia. In one instance, one of the vehicles used by the crime group to smuggle migrants was stopped by Hungarian authorities in Austria after a pursuit through Slovakia. At least 10 smuggling cases had been detected in Austria, Germany, Hungary and Slovakia by law enforcement authorities in the last couple of months. As a result, 10 drivers were previously arrested in Austria and Slovakia. In the following days, several other suspects involved in those cases were identified and arrested."

In response, the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Right, part of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), and Europol are co-hosting a major conference from 26 to 28 June 2013 in Alicante, Spain. The conference aims to strengthen cross-border and inter-agency cooperation and to find practical ways to help in the fight against Pharmacrime in the EU. In 2012 for example, fake medicines topped the list of articles detained by European customs authorities, with over 27 million items seized.   Paul Maier, Director of the Observatory commented: “Together with Europol, the Pharmaceutical Security Institute (PSI) and with valuable input from our Commission colleagues, we are determined to help Member States deal with this crucial problem which affects consumer and patient safety and public health in general. The Observatory´s cooperative platform has been set up to foster knowledge and collaboration between EU and international enforcement authorities, industry experts and national regulatory agencies and following this event a strategic assessment will be produced to help enforcement in the continued fight against this menacing business.  The Director of Europol Rob Wainwright said:” Pharmaceutical crime is highly lucrative for criminals and can have extremely dangerous consequences for citizens. It is very important to gather all stakeholders: enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and the private sector around the table to exchange and enhance communication. The excellent cooperation with the OHIM, and all actors at the European level, enables Europol to provide better support for the Member States tackling this type of crime, and dismantling the organised crime groups behind this trade”. With the support of the PSI, a non-profit organisation representing major pharmaceutical companies active in this fight, the conference brings together, in the first European event of its kind, almost all European and International authorities competent in this field such as INTERPOL, the World Customs Organisation, the Council of Europe and European Commission services as well as EU Police, Customs, health and medicines regulatory agencies and private partner experts.

4423,EUROPOL_NEWS_1605,2012-06-14,"France, Bulgaria, Poland and Belgium join forces to dismantle a criminal network involved in trafficking in human beings","JOINT EUROJUST – EUROPOL PRESS RELEASE On 12 June 2012, judicial and law enforcement authorities in four countries (France, Bulgaria, Poland and Belgium) successfully conducted a joint operation - supported and coordinated by Eurojust and Europol - against a trafficking in human beings (THB) criminal network operating in several Member States. The investigation was started in October 2010 in France by the inter-regional judicial police of Lyon, together with the anti-trafficking central police agency (O.C.R.T.E.H), under the supervision of the Lyon organised crime inter-regional court (JIRS). The operation relates to procurement and THB involving Bulgarian citizens. Young women were recruited in Bulgaria for the purpose of sexual exploitation in several European countries, including Belgium and France. Proceeds were collected by procurers, transferred using Western Union orders and invested in Bulgaria. A Joint Investigation Team  co-funded by Eurojust was set up between Bulgaria and France, with the participation of Europol, to tackle this organised crime group more effectively, but, given the mobility of perpetrators, the involvement of Poland and Belgium in the coordinated action became necessary. To facilitate direct cooperation, French police officers were present during the operations in Bulgaria, Belgium and Poland. Six European Arrest Warrants (EAWs), four of which were issued in the course of action, were transmitted by French authorities and nine persons in total were arrested. Thirteen house searches were carried out, resulting in the seizure of a large body of documentary evidence and mobile telephones. A coordination centre was set up at Eurojust starting at 6:00, run by the Eurojust French Desk with the assistance of the Case Analysis Unit, which provided significant support in the execution of the EAWs. The operation was supported on the day by Europol’s trafficking in human beings team and the deployment of its mobile office. The intelligence gathered during the operation was analysed and exchanged in real time, the collected data was immediately cross-matched, and previously unknown links to other investigations were identified. This coordinated multi-agency approach brought added value to the operation. Mr Jamin, Assistant to the Eurojust National Member for France, commented: “This operation demonstrates once more the absolute necessity to combine efforts on all sides – judicial and law enforcement – and in all Member States to achieve success”. Mrs Lilova, Eurojust National Member for Bulgaria, added: “Simultaneous operations were carried out in three different regions in Bulgaria, which required a high level of commitment and coordination from our national authorities. For the proper handling of EAWs, the support of the coordination centre was really an asset”.

The meeting was organised by the Hungarian Counter Terrorism Centre (TEK) and attended by experts from Europol and the Europol-coordinated working group Dumas which is a key forum for international counter terrorism cooperation. Representatives from 25 countries shared their experience on the problem of travelling fighters and discussed the practical issues of law enforcement cooperation. The experts agreed that the successful monitoring of the foreign fighters' phenomenon should be based on effective cooperation between EU law enforcement agencies. Key tasks are to map individuals and groups who pose a threat to the national security of EU Member States, to tackle the radicalisation process and to develop preventive and reactive measures to cope with this threat. To this end, it is important to improve active information exchange between EU law enforcement agencies. Europol can facilitate this by offering its existing counter terrorism capabilities for secure information exchange, operational support and to provide a strategic overview. The meeting in the Hungarian capital expresses the aim of the European Union law enforcement communities to face this new terrorism challenge even more effectively by increasing information exchange and improving international cooperation via existing cooperation channels. "
3569,EUROPOL_NEWS_0750,2017-11-30,"Organised criminals dealing with electronic payments disrupted in Italy, Bulgaria and Czech Republic","Four key members of an international criminal network responsible for compromising payment card data and illegal transactions against European citizens were arrested today, 30 November 2017, during a joint law enforcement operation called “Neptune”. The operation run by the Italian Carabinieri, in cooperation with the Bulgarian General Directorate of Combating Organised Crime, and the National Police of Czech Republic, supported by Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) culminated today with the arrest of four Bulgarian citizens. The leaders of the transnational criminal group actively supervised all stages of criminal activities, including placing technical equipment on ATMs in the central areas of European cities, producing counterfeit credit cards and subsequently cashing out money from ATMs in non-European countries, for example Belize, Indonesia and Jamaica. During the coordinated action today, dozens of ATMs were identified as being tampered by placing skimming devices such as micro cameras and magnetic strip readers. Over 1000 counterfeit credit cards were seized and evidence of many fraudulent international transactions worth more than EUR 50 000 were collected. The investigation started at the end of 2015, and from the very beginning the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) assisted the investigation by providing forensic and analytical support, organising on-the-spot forensic activities as well as analysing seized laptops and smartphones. The coordination and exchange of intelligence has been supported by the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) set up at Europol. Since most of the illegal transactions with counterfeit cards took place overseas, the cooperation through dedicated investigative networks set up by Europol has been instrumental. A key factor for the successful dismantling of this criminal organization was the close police cooperation between police forces from Italy, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, supported by Europol. Working closely with the banking sector, law enforcement made another significant step towards making electronic transactions safer in the European Union.  "

The operation led to the seizures of personal computers, credit cards, properties, vehicles and other assets with an overall estimated value of over €1.5 million.  The criminal organisation was using a wide network of money mules in Italy, created to launder criminal proceeds from a variety of cybercrime activities. The criminal group was involved in financial frauds and cyber scams such as rental fraud (fraud through the advertisement of non-existent properties to rent) and CEO fraud (impersonating a company official to trigger large transfers to bogus accounts). With these frauds, the criminals were deceiving victims across Europe into making wire transfers to Italian bank accounts, owned by the money mules. It is estimated that the criminal group has generated up to €20 million losses per year for victims across Europe. Europol supported the operation by facilitating information exchange and providing analytical support. During the two action days, Europol deployed an expert to Italy to cross-check in real time operational information against Europol’s databases and provide leads to the investigators in the field. Eurojust facilitated the coordination of the operation and the cooperation between the judicial authorities involved in the case."

However, their exact addresses are still unknown to us. Can you help us find them? While most of us are enjoying a well-deserved summer break, criminals are not taking time off from crime. Holiday destinations have proven to be popular hiding places for criminals on the run from law enforcement. They might even have chosen the same destination as you… That’s why your information can be vital to catch some of Europe’s Most Wanted fugitives. Law enforcement across Europe, through the European Network of Fugitive Active Search Teams (ENFAST) and Europol, are asking for your help to find out their exact locations, to ensure they take responsibility for their serious crimes. These postcards we have created on www.eumostwanted.eu/summercampaign feature Europe’s Most Wanted fugitives, who have committed serious crimes in 21 EU countries, for whom traditional investigative measures have so far not led to the locations of the suspects.  They are believed to be hiding in a different country to where the crime was committed, and the members of ENFAST are working closely together to make sure these fugitives do not evade justice. By sharing these postcards and providing information, you can help us complete that last piece of the puzzle so that we can ultimately reach the fugitives. The more the postcards are seen, the better the chance of police locating these criminals and putting them behind bars! 36 EU Most Wanted criminals arrested so far Crowdsourcing the search has proved to be very successful in tracking down fugitives in the past. Since the launch of www.eumostwanted.eu in early 2016, more than 2.5 million unique visitors have visited the website. 36 criminals featured as most wanted fugitives have been arrested, of whom at least 11 were apprehended as a direct result of information provided by the public via the EU Most Wanted platform. Four fugitives turned themselves in after appearing on the list. Europe’s Most Wanted was initiated by the ENFAST community, with the full support of Europol. The members of ENFAST are all specialised in locating criminals on the run who are suspected, or have been convicted, of serious crimes and are subjects of European Arrest Warrants. The majority of these criminals have committed murders, fraud or other serious offences, or are trafficking drugs."

The operation led to 47 arrests, house searches in Gibraltar and Spain and the seizure of €19 000 in cash, 12 smartphones, five cars and various documents. A total of 16 devices were successfully examined: six mobile phones, four media storage devices and six SIM cards.  Between €7 000 and €8 000 to enter the EU  The organised crime group, active in Morocco, Gibraltar and Spain, was facilitating the UK visa application procedure in the British embassy in Rabat. Each migrant paid between €7 000 and €8 000 to the facilitators. The criminal organisation would have gained about €1 million from these illegal activities. Drivers, taxi drivers and staff to manage travel tickets – also part of the organisation – charged migrants an additional €100 to €200 on top of the €500 to €700 paid for secondary movements within the EU. Once the visas were granted, the migrants arrived in Gibraltar by plane or ferry from Morocco. In Gibraltar they were picked up by members of the organised criminal group and driven to Spain, hidden in off-road vehicles with tinted windows. In Spain, the migrants were provided with temporary accommodation or bus tickets to travel to another part of Spain or cross over to other EU Member States.  Europol supported the investigation with intelligence analysis and facilitated the information exchange. Europol deployed a mobile office in Gibraltar and Spain to cross-check operational information against Europol’s databases. Additionally, forensic extractions of devices were carried out at Europol’s headquarters and the results were analysed by experts from Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre.     In 2010 the European Union set up a four-year Policy Cycle to ensure greater continuity in the fight against serious international and organised crime. In March 2017 the Council of the EU decided to continue the EU Policy Cycle for organised and serious international crime for the 2018 - 2021 period. This multiannual Policy Cycle aims to tackle the most significant threats posed by organised and serious international crime to the EU in a coherent and methodological manner. This is achieved by improving and strengthening cooperation between the relevant services of EU Member States, institutions and agencies, as well as non-EU countries and organisations, including the private sector where relevant. Migrant smuggling is one of the priorities for the Policy Cycle. "
4033,EUROPOL_NEWS_1215,2015-07-01,Joint international cooperation leads to the seizure of over 15 tonnes of cannabis resin,"The Guardia Civil and the Agencia Tributaria ADUANAS in Spain delivered a serious blow to transnational drug trafficking activities by intercepting and seizing a shipment of almost 16 tonnes of cannabis resin transported on the merchant vessel JUST REEMA sailing under the Congolese flag. The competent authorities have taken into custody all nine members of the crew consisting of six Syrian and three Indian nationals. The estimated value of the illegal commodity amounts to approximately 24 million euros on the Spanish market, and at least twice as much in more distant EU countries. The vessel was boarded on the evening of 28 June 2015 and immediately secured by the Specialised Intervention Teams (UEI) of the Guardia Civil, not long after the vessel crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea. The boarding of the vessel took place in compliance with Article 17 of the 1988 UN Convention Against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs. The detection of the possible illicit nature of this maritime shipment was possible thanks to the coordinated and robust law enforcement partnership implemented against large-scale drugs trafficking across the Mediterranean Sea, driven by Spain, Italy and France in cooperation with other affected EU and Third States, with the support of Europol and CeCLAD – M. This joint operational cooperation framework also allowed for the constant monitoring of the illegal shipment along its journey in order to collectively assess and decide on the most suitable assets, time and place to execute the intervention. However, the verification of the illegal nature of the goods loaded on the ship did not turn out to be an easy undertaking. Once escorted into the Port of Malaga, the investigators of the Guardia Civil gained access to the storage chamber through its two entries, respectively hidden under tonnes of steel chains and loose salt used as a legal cover load. On-the-spot assistance was ensured by the French OCRTIS (Office Central pour la Répression du Traffic Illicite des Stupéfiants) and the Italian Guardia di Finanza and D.C.S.A. (Direzione Centrale per i Servizi Antidroga). Europol played a crucial role in this international law enforcement cooperation partnership by assisting in the facilitation of intelligence exchanges between the involved parties, providing subsequent criminal intelligence analysis, hosting the operational meetings and providing on-the-spot support. "
31756,EDA_NEWS_0657,2014-09-17,New EDA-designed air transport training course to launch next week," Eight aircraft, eight crews and more than 170 military personnel will gather next week in Zaragoza, Spain, for a true European first. From 21 September to 3 October, the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) will be joined by seven Member States and hosted by the Spanish Air Force. Initiated by the European Defence Agency in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC), this first-of-its-kind initiative is a perfect example of pooling and sharing. Its aim is to provide air transport crews with academic as well as flying training tactics and procedures through three main courses: single-ship, multiple-ships, and night-vision goggles (NVG). A dedicated tactics techniques and procedures manual will form the basis of this syllabus. The EATC is an important contributor to the EAATTC initiative, providing major support to the course in terms of human resources while also leading the cadre of instructors that will deliver the syllabus to the students. This course was designed by the EDA as a European alternative to the American AATTC initiative, a rendezvous that has been attended for decades by airlift crews from the US and allied nations. However, European Member States are now seeking different ways to provide their crews with this much-needed training. EAATTC is the perfect answer to that rising challenge, with European air forces now able to benefit from a high-level training closer to their home bases, thus saving the cost of a return trip across the Atlantic. At the end of EAATTC 14, an initial class of students will be the very first to graduate from this European-led course. Background EAATTC is one of the tangible outputs of the wider European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership, launched in 2011 and now gathering 19 Member States plus NO (AT, BE, BG, CZ, DE, EL, ES, FI, FR, IT, LT, LU, NL, PL, PT, RO, SK, SE and HU). The initiative aims to achieve a higher level of interoperability between airlift crews from different nations and to increase harmonisation of advanced tactical training.

31873,EDA_NEWS_0774,2013-07-17,Hot Blade 2013: Preparing Together for Operations," Starting today, Portugal hosts the multinational helicopter exercise HOT BLADE 2013 (HB13) at Ovar Military Airfield, near Porto. More than 700 military personnel, 26 helicopters and seven fixed wing aircraft from Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal participate in the exercise, which lasts until 31 July 2013. HB13 is part of the European Defence Agency's Helicopter Training Programme. HB13 allows European helicopter crews to practice operations in a hot, high and dusty environment, simulating the challenge and the dynamic conditions that participating forces encounter if they deploy to current theatres of operation. Besides the focus on flying in challenging environmental conditions, the exercise is developed to train joint interoperability tasks including Air Assault (AA), Special Operations Aviation (SOA), Combat Service Support (CSS), Close Air Support (CAS) including Urban CAS and Emergency CAS, Convoy/helicopter escorts, Reconnaissance and Security (R&S) operations, Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), Personnel Recovery (PR), Military/Non Military extractions (NEO Ops), Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC). The exercise is developed on a building block approach design, starting with cross-training activities on small COMAO missions, in order to build a mutual understanding of each participant’s equipment and standard operational procedures. As the exercises progresses the complexity and numbers of assets in each COMAO missions increase. Crews from all nations will use for the first time standing operating procedures. Helicopter Training Programme HB13 builds on EDA’s Helicopter Training Programme which is consisting of the HEP (Helicopter Exercise Programme), HTC (Helicopter Tactics Course), EHTIC (European Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course), OELC (Operational English Language Course), DisSim CCD (Distributed Simulation Capability Concept Demonstrator) and the Basic Helicopter Flying Training (BHFT) projects/programmes. The exercise programme has so far delivered five multinational exercises with 123 helicopters, 227 crews and over 5,000 personnel participating. Over 50% crews that have attended these exercises later subsequently deployed to Afghanistan. In November 2012, defence ministers of thirteen nations signed a ten years programme arrangement for the Helicopter Exercise Programme. This commitment is a concrete indication that training together is an integral part of European capability and interoperability. “HB13 is the 6th EDA helicopter exercise, but it is also the first in many ways. It is the first exercise in a 10-year programme agreed by thirteen countries, it is the first exercise where we are flying to commonly agreed procedures, and most excitingly for me, it is the first exercise where we have been able to introduce instructors – who themselves are graduates from the first European Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course. These instructors drawn from Germany, Sweden and UK are the ‘best of the best’ and I am looking forward to seeing them mentor some of the less experienced crews, as they meet the planning and flying challenges of the exercise”, said Wing Commander Andy Gray, in charge of EDA’s Helicopter Training Programme.

31522,EDA_NEWS_0423,2016-06-16,EDA Composite Air Operations (COMAO) planning course held in the UK," End of May, helicopter crews and military staff dealing with Composite Air Operations (COMAO) from across Europe met for an EDA-led Planning Course at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, United Kingdom. During a full week, participants went through complex mission planning exercises within a contested air and land scenario, led by the Chief Instructor, Sqn Ldr Mike Gallagher. Composite Air Operations are interrelated and/or limited in both time and space, where units differing in type and/or role are put under unified control to achieve a common objective. The need for organising the COMAO course arose from lessons identified during the previous Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) and Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) exercise in Italy in 2015.  COMAO is a broad and complex subject and the number of military personnel with operational and training experience in this domain is shrinking across Europe.  This is especially pertinent to the rotary community which has limited access to existing organisations such as the Tactical Leadership Programme (TLP).  Additionally, bespoke courses in which complex helicopter operations are the main focus currently do actually not exist. The aim of the course at RAF Linton-on-Ouse was to increase participants’ knowledge of COMAO planning, using the so-called 4T’s (Task, Target, Threat and Tactics) process.  Equally important, the course allowed to create an environment in which numerous nations meet, work together and develop their capabilities while acquiring an in-depth knowledge and understanding of each other’s platforms. The course was very well attended which is testimony for the high demand of COMAO planning trainings across Europe.  There were helicopter trainees from Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Hungary, Belgium and the UK. Tactics and weapons instructors were provided from Sweden, the Dutch Weapons School and the UK.  Vitally, the course was supported by 8 Sqn AWACS from RAF Waddington and 100 Sqn Hawks from RAF Leeming bringing with them a wealth of knowledge concerning Air Battle Space Management and a remarkable breadth of fast-jet capabilities.  The UK provided a Ground Liaison Officer with comprehensive intelligence support.  In total, the platforms present at the course included the AB212, AS532, Mi-17, CH-47, CH-53, A-109, AH-64, Navy Lynx, E3-D Sentry and the numerous fast-jet platforms represented by the 100 Sqn pilots. The course began with lectures and platform capability briefs and was followed by 3 days of scenarios with one mission being planned and briefed each day. As the course was progressing, the missions increased in complexity, running from the start of hostilities and covert insertions for bridge demolition and distraction operations to troop reinforcements and Non-combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO).  The final event culminated in a complex night mission to arrest a High Value Target (HVT).  The threat level was raised each day; therefore the tactics to deal with those threats had to be reconsidered too before being implemented. The outcome of the course was praised as overwhelmingly positive by all the participants.  One of the key takeaways mentioned by them was that such courses need to be longer so that more time can be spent on the theoretical aspects and a deeper understanding of platform capabilities can be gained.  This recommendation will most likely be taken on board for the next edition, probably in 2017.   More information: EDA Helicopter Initiative project page EDA Exercises and Training project page COLD BLADE Helicopter training 2016 (news, March 2016)   "
31702,EDA_NEWS_0603,2015-03-18,European Parliament exchange of views on cyber defence," The European Parliament Subcommittee on Security and Defence (SEDE) held an exchange of views on cybersecurity and defence with ENISA, EEAS and EDA representatives on 16 March 2015. Peter Round, EDA Director Capability, Armament & Technology was invited to brief member of the subcommittee on EDA activities in the area of cyber defence. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), emphasised in his presentation on cyber security the increasing number of security incidents. Rudolf Roy, Head of Security Policy Division, Conflict Prevention and Security Policy Directorate (EEAS) highlighted among other topics the importance of secure cyberspace for CSDP missions and operations equally important to other domains of warfare (land, sea, air and space). In his presentation, Peter Round concentrated first on successful EDA projects in the area of cyber defence, on the EU cyber defence policy framework, EDA support to operations and preparations for the European Council discussion on defence in June.  In the last three years, the Agency has completed ten cyber defence related projects with a financial volume of about 2 million euros. This equals to approximately 10% of EDA’s operational budget. Among these ten projects are a stocktaking study of cyber defence capabilities among all EDA Member States and EU institutions, the establishment of a cyber defence research agenda and cyber defence training courses for senior military decision makers as well as the assessment of the feasibility of a EU Cyber Defence Centre for CSDP.  “The Agency continues to give high priority to providing cyber domain support to ongoing operations and missions”, Peter Round highlighted. So far, the Agency has delivered three cyber awareness seminars for the staff in charge of the EUFOR RCA operation. The finalisation of the feasibility assessment for an EU Cyber Defence Centre provides several options on the set-up for such a centre for CSDP operations and missions. EDA’s project team cyber defence with experts from 24 EDA Member States and EU institutions is currently evaluating these proposals. A consolidated report will be introduced to the political decision-making process by the end of the semester.  Finally, Peter Round emphasised the limited resources dedicated to cyber defence within the EU institutions. He underlined the need for increased civil-military cooperation in the field to maximise synergies.  Members of the European Parliament congratulated the speakers on the progress made in the domain of cybersecurity and defence following the taskings of the European Council in December 2013. Questions related mostly to cyber defence capabilities available to Member States, critical infrastructures for cyber defence and EU-NATO cooperation in the field.  Picture © European Parliament, 2015 More information: You can watch the video of the SEDE meeting on the European Parliament website.  EDA factsheet on cyber defence  ​   "
31899,EDA_NEWS_0800,2013-06-03,EDA at Paris Air Show," Several of the Agency’s flagship projects are in the air domain: air-to-air refuelling, air traffic insertion of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, military air transport activities, SESAR impact on the armed forces, as well as military airworthiness and governmental satellite communications. For the latter two the Agency organises high-level seminars during the Internal Paris Air Show “Le Bourget”.   Military Airworthiness The high-level military airworthiness seminar will take place on 18 June and will feature speakers from the European Defence Agency, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European aerospace industry as well as national Ministries of Defence.  The seminar will address the political implications of the harmonisation of military airworthiness, areas for closer cooperation with EASA, as well as the impact of harmonisation on current and future military airworthiness activities. Representatives from governmental, industrial and national military airworthiness authorities’ are invited to participate in the seminar.  The seminar will take place in the VIPARIS Conference Centre, Hall 2C, Salle 1, from 3 PM to 7 PM (including networking cocktail). For more information click here.  Governmental Satellite Communication The high-level seminar on governmental satellite communication will take place on 19 June 2013 and is split between a seminar in the morning with keynote speakers and a dedicated workshop in the afternoon for government representatives only.  Military Satellite Communication (MILSATCOM) has been recognised as a very promising domain for Pooling & Sharing as synergies can mitigate the huge financial impact generated by the growing demand for resilient space-based communication in operations. The option to pool resources in the domain of MILSATCOM is particularly pertinent to the replacement of the current generation of space assets owned by France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, whose entire phase-out expected between 2018 and 2025 offers a unique opportunity to consider the establishment of a common initiative. In this perspective, the Agency has drafted a “Secure Telecom by Satellite” (SECTELSAT) concept presented to the Defence Ministers in April 2013.  The seminar will take place in the Auditorium (VI Paris Conference Centre) from 9 AM to 5.30 PM.

31221,EDA_NEWS_0122,2018-12-11,OCCAR-EDA exchange of letter on European Secure Software defined Radio (ESSOR) programme," At yesterday’s OCCAR-EDA bilateral in Bonn, OCCAR Director Arturo Alfonso-Meiriño and the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, Jorge Domecq, have exchanged letters describing the role of the EDA in support of the ESSOR Programme. OCCAR manages the ESSOR Programme for Finland, France, Italy, Poland and Spain, whilst Germany is currently an observer to this Programme. The ESSOR Programme launched its Operational Capability 1 phase in November 2017, with an Operational Budget of €50 million. In 2006, EDA established the Project Team Software Defined Radio (SDR) with the goal to define a common European concept and position on SDR architecture developments, promoting the working relations with the most important SDR stakeholders and coordinating the vision, policies and initiatives for emergence of SDR developments that serve European interest and autonomy. This is in line with EDA’s role as the European forum for joint capability development and the prioritised Capability Development Plan (CDP) scope of Tactical CIS in response to CSDP requirements to greatly enhance the interoperability of communication systems.  Considering that enhanced cooperation with OCCAR also features among the recommendations endorsed by the Defence Ministers after EDA’s recent Long Term Review (LTR), with this exchange of letters, EDA formally commits to facilitate the coherence between the ESSOR Programme and the activities of EDA in Software Defined Radio (SDR) area, and to promote the ESSOR products, in particular the waveform and architecture of the system.   "

On 29 July 2010 there will be an open day and a graduation ceremony for all course participants, to which senior Military Representatives from EDA participating Member States have also been invited. Following the graduation ceremony, there will be an industry exhibition. The intention is to show to the newly qualified course participants and visiting Military Representatives the range of possible search equipments available across the European Union. The course members are practitioners, who will develop the capabilities in their own countries. As this is a relatively new discipline for most militaries this is an ideal opportunity for industry to demonstrate their search equipment to those who will be able to influence the direction of their National Military Search capability development. Those who are interested in attending should contact denis.giovannoli@esercito.difesa.it to register their interest. The exhibition will be free, but exhibitors will be responsible for their own expenses."
31429,EDA_NEWS_0330,2017-03-01,11th Edition of EDA Helicopter Exercise Programme Confirmed for Hungary in May," Exercise FIRE BLADE 2017 will be hosted by Hungary at Pápa Airbase and takes place from the 1st to the 12th of May. 17 air assets and 450 personnel are expected to take part in this live fire focused training exercise.   FIRE BLADE 2017 (FB17) marks the 11th helicopter exercise under the umbrella of the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). The HEP is one of the European Defence Agency’s (EDA) helicopter training projects and programmes. It is the first time that Hungary will host a HEP event, thus becoming the 7th member state to do so.  In excess of 450 personnel are due to take part in this exercise programme. A total of 17 air assets from 5 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Slovenia) are expected to take part. In addition, observers from Italy and Czech Republic are foreseen. FB17 will deliver tactical training, over a 12 day intensive programme, offering participants an unique opportunity to plan and execute missions within a joint combined framework. FB17 will be designed to allow European helicopter crews to train, adopting joint procedures while operating in a challenging scenario. Today at the EDA in Brussels the Final Coordination Conference for FB17 took place. Following on from the Main Planning Conference which was held last October in Hungary, today’s conference put the final preparations in place ahead of the beginning of FB17 on May 1st. Tom Bennington, Head of Education, Training & Exercise Unit at EDA commented, “the exercise gives a good opportunity to train in a realistic operational setting. Specifically we will be working with Special Forces, and will be focusing on live weapons firing using the Composite Air Operations Concept, effectively operating the helicopters with fast jets and ground assets [e.g. surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems]”. At the event, on behalf of the host nation Hungary, Lieutenant colonel Péter Simon of the Hungarian Air Force and Commander of the Air Task Force for exercise FB17 said, “as per previous Blade exercises, FB17 will have its own training subjects, in this case live firing. Hungary is an excellent location for live fire exercises due to diversity and quality of ranges available to visiting European crews”.     The aim of the exercise is to enhance interoperability at a tactical level between helicopter units by using the COMAO concept in a combined, joint, realistic and challenging environment and to teach and learn helicopter Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs). During FB17 the units will fly a diverse set of day and night training missions, with a focus on live firing operations. FB17 is a real-world example of what can be achieved through European defence cooperation.   Further updates on FB17 can also be found on Twitter using  #FIREBLADE2017.     More information: Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) Pictures from Exercise BLACK BLADE 2016 Fact Sheet Exercise BLACK BLADE 2016 "

32165,EDA_NEWS_1066,2007-06-28,EU Governments Set Timetable for Initial Plan to Strengthen Defence Capabilities," The EDA Steering Board today agreed a roadmap and a timetable to produce a comprehensive Capability Development Plan (CDP), which will help EU governments identify the key capability areas that they must work together to develop to meet the security threats of the future, and to target  possible areas for collaboration to deliver the necessary capabilities. The meeting of senior defence planners from the 26 EU governments participating in the European Defence Agency asked for an initial element of the CDP to be delivered early next year and a full draft of the plan to be ready for the Steering Board to review next July. “We have now clearly set out what we want and when we want it by,” said Lo Casteleijn, who chaired the meeting on behalf of Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency. “The CDP must deliver ‘actionable conclusions’: agreed capability development priorities, initial action plans and identified cooperative opportunities, which participating Member States may choose to pursue individually or in combinations inside or outside the EDA environment,” he added. The work on the CDP builds on the EDA’s Long-Term Vision report of last year, which set out possible contexts for EU crisis-management operations under the European Security and Defence Policy in 2020 and beyond - and described the sort of military and other capabilities which would be required to carry them out effectively. The CDP will make that analysis more specific and thus more useable, identify priorities and areas for collaboration and give guidance to industry. The four work strands of the CDP, led by the EDA and the EU Military Committee, involve identifying shortfalls from existing goals, doing capability studies on key issues to develop the LTV guidance, building a database of current national defence plans and programmes, and drawing lessons from current experience for future capability needs. The Steering Board said the CDP would not be a supranational military equipment or capability plan replacing national defence plans and programmes, but would support national decision-making. It should ensure that emerging technology opportunities influence capability development and provide a focus for R&T activity and investment, thus helping to strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base by making clear to industry what will be needed in the future. On other issues, the Steering Board welcomed the launch of a new 5 nation - Spain, Italy, Germany, France, and Sweden - collaboration effort on personal equipment for infantrymen, aiming at increasing interoperability and commonality of this increasingly high-tech equipment in the next decade. Three further nations - Poland, Finland and Austria - expressed their interest in joining the programme. The Steering Board also agreed to commission a report – to be written by an expert known as a “Wise Pen” – on a European approach to Network Enabled Capabilities. Defence Ministers have already agreed that “Network-enabled capability must be fundamental development priority for ESDP operations”. The concept paper will outline the aims, the required capabilities and how these capabilities could be delivered, address the civil and the military dimension ESDP operations, and propose high level guidance. It will focus in particular on how to create greater capacities in bringing all necessary civilian resources to bear in crises and on enabling the best possible situational awareness and deployment of assets and capabilities in-theatre. The meeting also considered a series of reports on strategic lift, focusing on how to address the known shortfalls in the capacity to rapidly transport military equipment and forces to EU operations. The EDA reported that the situation would have to be addressed by using a combination of military transport, assured civilian contracted capability and a more efficient approach to the spot market. It also recommended setting up a project team with government representatives to look into possible combinations of air and sea transport, including new “fast ship” capabilities."
31282,EDA_NEWS_0183,2018-04-09,5th European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training takes off in the Netherlands," The 5th European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training exercise (EART 2018) kicked off today 9 April at Eindhoven Air Base in the Netherlands. EART 2018 brings together tankers from Germany, the Netherlands, France and - for the first time - from a non-European country, the United States, for a two week training exercise ending on 20 April.  The European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training (EART) concept was introduced in 2014 under the European Defence Agency’s (EDA) air-to-air refuelling initiative, and is run by the European Air Transport Command (EATC) from Eindhoven airbase. The exercise is supported by the host nation (the Netherlands), the Eindhoven-based Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE) and EDA.  EART is organised on a yearly basis in combination with the ‘Frisian Flag’ fighter training exercise, also organized by the Netherlands, that operates from Leeuwarden Airbase. The objective is to train air crews and engineers in planning and executing complex air-to-air refuelling (AAR) operations in a multinational and realistic COMAO (composite air operation) environment, with the overall aim of enhancing effectiveness and interoperability of forces. A particular focus is also put on facilitating the certification processes between tankers and receiver aircraft. The exercise director for EART 2018 is Colonel Andrea Massucci (Italian Air Force).   Eindhoven for two weeks “tanker town of Europe” AAR is a significant force enabler and multiplier as it enhances combat effectiveness by extending the range, payload and endurance of receiver aircraft. It allows air power to be projected at greater distances or concentrated where and when it is needed mostly. “Air-to-air refueling capacity is the backbone of modern day air power. Without it, we don’t do much. Air power continuously needs fuel”, said Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Oostema, Head of Operations at Eindhoven air base.  However, delivering a guaranteed, continuous coverage of air-to-air refueling capacity is challenging. “That’s why we need to train together. The European air-to-air refuelling Training (EART) at Eindhoven air base provides us with that unique opportunity”, Lieutenant-Colonel Oostema stressed. “For two weeks Eindhoven air base will be the tanker town of Europe”.   Background: EDA’s global approach on AAR EDA has developed a global approach on AAR with three objectives: optimizing the use of assets, increasing the overall AAR capacity and reducing fragmentation of the fleet. This work has led to three complementary work-strands, on some of which EDA is cooperating closely with other agencies and organizations like OCCAR, the Movement Coordination Center Europe (MCCE) and the European Air Transport Command (EATC). EART 2018 is part of the first work strand (optimization of existing capabilities), which is achieved by supporting training exercises. In this domain, EDA has also taken the lead to streamline the different certification processes leading to a clearance. By standardizing these processes the different aviation authorities can easily identify the differences between their own process and their counterpart. By working closely together, already fielded capabilities and future capabilities, can work more cost efficiently and increase their operational output.     More information: Air-to-Air Refueling EDA project page Air-to-Air Refueling factsheet EATC website  "
32130,EDA_NEWS_1031,2009-03-05,New EDA Project on Space-Based Earth Surveillance System," The EDA Steering Board has agreed to approve a project for the next generation European military earth observation satellites. This Multinational Space-based Imaging System (MUSIS) project has been launched by six European Union Member States: Belgium, Germany, Greece, France, Italy and Spain. The project has now become an EDA Category B project and will be open to participation of other EDA participating Member States, if their proposed contribution is acceptable to the existing contributing Members. The Agency’s Capability Development Plan (CDP) considers space-based imaging capacities essential for ESDP missions. The MUSIS project aims at establishing a multinational space-based imaging system for surveillance, reconnaissance and observation to ensure continuity of services from the current French Helios II, German SAR LUPE and Italian Cosmo-Skymed and Pléiades systems, from 2015-2017 onwards. “Space-based related assets are critical to improve European military capabilities, including for informationgathering. The approved project will be critical to ensure this capability in the longer-term and I welcome very much the initiative of the six EU Member States to bring it to EDA”, Javier Solana, Head of the Agency, said. One of the roles for EDA will be to seek synergies with earth observation programmes on the civilian side, in particular with the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme of the European Commission. “This is another example of how EDA is proving its added value, not only in bringing together participating Member States’ efforts, but connecting at the same time military to civil space agendas. We will liaise with the Commission and the European Space Agency to ensure complementarity of research and technology, and to seek other synergies“, Alexander Weis, EDA’s Chief Executive said."
31808,EDA_NEWS_0709,2014-04-10,European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training Delivers First Results," A Distinguished Visitors (DV) Day is held as part of the first European Air-to-Air Refuelling training (EART14) at Eindhoven Air Base on 10 April 2014. The day brings together high-level military figures to witness and learn about the ongoing training. EART14 runs from 31 March to 11 April, with German and Dutch aircraft and crews present for the entire period and Italy joining for the second week. The training was developed by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC) and Dutch armed forces. It runs alongside the highly recognised Dutch fighter exercise Frisian Flag, to provide crews with the opportunity to take part in dedicated Air-to-Air (AAR) scenarios embedded in realistic combat situations.   Experiences so far In the first week the Dutch KDC-10 and German A-310 flew 15 sorties  between them, off-loading more than 135,000 Kilos of fuel. The training has allowed tanker and logistic crews to enhance their skills in realistic AAR scenarios, helping ensure that crews remain proficient in areas outside of their daily AAR tasks. Crews have built up knowledge of the characteristics of aircraft used by other EU countries, while flying sorties in the morning and afternoon has allowed them to practice their quick turnaround procedures.   Multinational cooperation Speaking about the training, Giampaolo Lillo, EDA Director for Cooperation Planning & Support, commented “this first European Air-to-Air Refuelling training is a prime example of how Europe can optimise the use of its existing assets through multinational cooperation. The EDA has a role to play as an enabler, however the success of the training is thanks to the Netherlands as host nation, EATC, and the participating Member States.”   Background The EDA has a comprehensive plan to improve the AAR capabilities in Europe. Mandated by Defence Ministers, EDA is engaged in four work strands in this domain: short-term gap filling; optimisation of existing assets; optimisation of AAR capacity offered by the future A400M fleet and enhancement of Europe’s strategic tanker capability by creating a multinational Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) capability. As part of this global approach, the EDA, Italy and the Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE) jointly organised the first collective European Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) clearance trial on the Italian KC767 in September 2013. This enhanced AAR capabilities, as technical and operational clearances are mandatory to provide or receive fuel and they are thus a prerequisite to interoperability in multinational operations. Aircraft from France and Sweden participated in the campaign to obtain technical and operational AAR clearances against the Italian strategic airlift tanker.  More information Pictures are available on Flickr.

The Inventory also includes all notifications for EINECS substances.  Helsinki, 27 September 2012 – With this update, ECHA has successfully addressed concerns expressed by users that for some substances, not all classifications were published leading to a skewed image. Now, the Inventory shows all notifications for substances for which there is at least one notification classifying it as hazardous according to Article 119(1) of REACH. In addition, all notifications for substances on the EC inventory are also now provided. By including all notified information for each published substance, the Agency is promoting greater transparency and completeness of the classification information. To facilitate the further consolidation of classifications, ECHA is currently developing a web-based discussion platform, which will be released during the course of 2013.  This will stimulate Industry to make every effort to come, as close as possible, to agreed entries when self-classifying substances. The current version of the inventory contains approximately 5.3 million notifications relating to 120 000 substances. The Inventory is maintained by the Agency and the data is refreshed on a regular basis with incoming and updated C&L information.

2076,ECHA_NEWS_0769,2012-04-11,ECHA to update REACH-IT and IUCLID 5,"ECHA to update REACH-IT and IUCLID 5 ECHA/NA/12/10 News alert Media enquiries: ECHA Press The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is going to release a new version of IUCLID 5 in late May 2012 and subsequently a new release of REACH-IT. Later this year, ECHA will start publishing more information on chemical substances. Helsinki, 11 April 2012 - The new IUCLID 5.4 release will bring about changes mainly on how certain substance information included in the Chemical Safety Report (CSR) is reported. In addition, certain information included in the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) will be made publicly available. As a continuation of the IUCLID 5 update, a new version of REACH-IT will be released later in the summer. The new REACH-IT release will accept only IUCLID 5.4 dossiers. ECHA publishes a Question and Answer (Q&A) document to inform stakeholders in advance about the impact on the upcoming submissions of registration and other dossiers. The information included in the CSR is an essential element to manage the conditions of a safe use of a substance. IUCLID 5.4 will include additional sections to allow the information on the conditions of manufacture/use, exposure assessment (including conditions of safe use) and risk characterisation to be reported in a more structured, transparent and searchable manner. The standardisation of reporting the CSR information in IUCLID will enable the exchange and efficient processing of this information between companies either for preparing their registrations or for re-using part of it in their SDS. It will also enable authorities to process and evaluate this type of information more easily in their regulatory activities. The information, which is made publicly available from the SDS, includes the name of the registrant of a registered substance, the registration number and the outcome of the PBT (Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic chemicals) assessment. IUCLID 5.4 will facilitate distinction between SDS information considered confidential business information and information considered public. This will enable automatic extraction, processing and publishing of selected (non-confidential) information on the ECHA website. The aim of the Q&A document is to highlight the main effects on industry and Member State Competent Authorities both in terms of IUCLID 5 planning (e.g. data migration, dossier submission and data dissemination) and dossier preparation. It allows users to familiarise themselves with the new and amended IUCLID 5 sections well before the release of the new version, and regulatory managers to keep up-to-date with the new requirements. Planning of the REACH-IT release and the IUCLID 5.4 dossier submission timeline is explained further in the Q&A document. ECHA will publish more detailed information about dissemination of the additional information contained in a registration dossier in the near future.

875,ECHA_PR_1094,2020-01-10,Four new substances added to Candidate List,"Four new substances added to Candidate List ECHA/PR/20/02 The Candidate List of substances of very high concern (SVHCs) for authorisation now contains 205 substances. Helsinki, 16 January 2020 - ECHA has added three new substances to the Candidate List due to their toxicity to reproduction and a fourth due to a combination of other properties of concern. This latter causes probable serious effects to human health and the environment, giving rise to an equivalent level of concern to carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic (CMR), persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) and very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) substances. The decision to include perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and its salts, was taken with the involvement of the Member State Committee (MSC). Substances included in the Candidate List for authorisation on 16 January 2020 and their SVHC properties: # Substance name EC number CAS number Reason for inclusion Examples of use(s) 1 Diisohexyl phthalate 276-090-2  71850-09-4 Toxic for reproduction (Article 57 (c))  Not registered under REACH. 2 2-benzyl-2-dimethylamino-4'-morpholinobutyrophenone 404-360-3 119313-12-1 Toxic for reproduction (Article 57 (c))  The substance is used in polymer production 3 2-methyl-1-(4-methylthiophenyl)-2-morpholinopropan-1-one 400-600-6 71868-10-5 Toxic for reproduction (Article 57 (c))  The substance is used in polymer production 4 Perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and its salts  - - Equivalent level of concern having probable serious effects to the environment (Article 57(f) - environment) 			Equivalent level of concern having probable serious effects to human health (Article 57(f) – human health) Used as a catalyst/ additive/reactant in polymer manufacture and in chemical synthesis. It is also used as a flame retardant in polycarbonate (for electronic equipment).   Background The Candidate List is a list of substances that may have serious effects on human health or the environment. Substances on the Candidate List are also known as substances of very high concern and are candidates for eventual inclusion in the Authorisation List. Once they are on the Authorisation List, industry will need to apply for permission to continue using the substance after the sunset date. Companies may have legal obligations resulting from the inclusion of the substance in the Candidate List. These obligations may apply to the listed substance on its own, in mixtures or in articles. In particular, any supplier of articles containing a Candidate List substance above a concentration of 0.1 % (weight by weight) has communication obligations towards customers down the supply chain and to consumers. In addition, importers and producers of articles containing the substance have six months from the date of its inclusion in the Candidate List (16 January 2020) to notify ECHA. Information on these obligations and related tools are available on ECHA’s website.

855,ECHA_NEWS_1074,2020-05-12,Grouping of chemicals speeds up regulatory action,"Grouping of chemicals speeds up regulatory action ECHA/NR/20/14 To speed up identifying and managing the risks of hazardous chemicals, ECHA is screening structurally similar substances in groups. Last year, the Agency together with national authorities reviewed around 220 high-volume substances of which 56 % needed more hazard data. Helsinki, 13 May 2020 – ECHA’s second report on the Integrated Regulatory Strategy gives an overview on the progress in addressing substances of concern and in the “mapping of the chemical universe”. It includes recommendations to authorities and industry on managing chemicals’ risks. In 2019, ECHA moved from a substance-by-substance approach to addressing structurally similar chemicals in groups. The aim is to speed up the identification of hazardous substances and get their risks controlled more quickly.  Together with Member States, the Agency reviewed around 220 substances registered above 100 tonnes per year and allocated them to different pools of the chemical universe for regulatory action. For 56 % of them, more data was needed to clarify the need for further risk management. For 22 % of the substances, no further action was proposed and 7 % were considered as high priority for EU regulatory risk management. The number of substances registered above 100 tonnes and not yet assigned to a pool in the chemical universe has reduced to around 2 400. The grouping approach also enabled ECHA to scrutinise more than 300 low-production volume substances in 2019. “The progress we have made with the Integrated Regulatory Strategy is a step towards better protecting Europe’s citizens. To gain the most impact, we have focused the work on high-volume substances, and we aim for more clarity on all chemicals registered above 100 tonnes by the end of 2020. Grouping similar substances helps to speed up and make regulatory actions more consistent. It also helps national authorities step up their efforts to manage chemical risks under REACH and other pieces of legislation,” says Jack de Bruijn, ECHA’s Director of Prioritisation and Integration. Mapping the chemical universe and assigning substances for further action is a key part of the Integrated Regulatory Strategy. The aim is to have full clarity for all registered substances by 2027. Report's recommendations ECHA’s Integrated Regulatory Strategy report covers an overview of the pre-regulatory steps (screening of groups by ECHA or Member States, expert group assessment and regulatory management option analysis), the evaluation processes and the regulatory risk management activities under REACH and CLP. It gives the following recommendations: Screening groups of substances, data generation and assessment should be further optimised to ensure substances are progressed to regulatory risk management without delay. Harmonised classification and labelling should become a priority, as it has a direct impact on company-level risk management, and is often the step before restriction, authorisation or other measures under other pieces of legislation are taken. The priority and appropriateness of previously identified, but still pending, follow-up actions should be reviewed and those substances which need further regulatory risk management should be progressed without delay. The compliance of registration information needs to be improved, in particular, for substances with a high potential for exposure and currently lacking appropriate hazard data. Compliance of dossiers, their systematic review and updates of registrations based on new information, remains industry’s responsibility. ECHA welcomes the initiative of industry associations to develop review programmes to help registrants review chemical safety data. Further enhance cooperation and coordination between authorities.   Background: chemical universe Overall, the chemical universe of over 21 000 registered substances (both high-volume and low volume substances) includes approximately: 330 substances have regulatory risk management under consideration; 1 550 substances are under data generation; 390 substances that already have regulatory risk management ongoing; and 700 substances where currently no further actions have been proposed after authority reviews.

These will be added to the Candidate List and may subsequently become subject to authorisation. The Committee also finalised 41 draft dossier evaluation decisions. Candidate List The MSC identified five new SVHCs: one, diborontrioxide, through written procedure and four dyes at its meeting. As a result of the discussions, it was agreed that the entry for the Candidate List will be made explicit so that it is evident that the dyes C.I. Basic Violet 3, C.I.Basic Blue 26, C.I. Solvent Blue 4 and 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)-4''-(methylamino)trityl alcohol are identified as SVHCs only if the concentration of the impurities Michler's ketone or Michler's base is equal to or higher than 0,1%. These five SVHCs will be included in the Candidate List in its next update together with eight further substances that did not require the MSC's involvement. The updated Candidate List will be published in due course on ECHA's website. Dossier Evaluation The MSC also unanimously agreed on nine draft dossier evaluation decisions (eight testing proposal draft decisions and one compliance check draft decision).   No unanimous agreement was reached by the MSC in the meeting on one draft decision addressing a testing proposal for meeting the information requirements for a two-generation reproductive toxicity. In fact, though the majority of MSC members supported a draft decision giving the registrant the choice between a two-generation study (1) and an extended one generation reproductive toxicity study (2) (EOGRTS) with the second generation, a minority of MSC members considered that only an EOGRTS with extra cohorts on immunotoxicity and neurotoxicity and without the second generation should be requested. In addition to the ten cases of dossier evaluation addressed at the meeting, the MSC agreed in written procedure on 23 draft dossier evaluation decisions. However, no unanimous agreement was reached in written procedure on eight draft decisions addressing testing proposals for meeting the information requirements for the two-generation reproductive toxicity where the EOGRTS was involved. The disagreement is mainly due to legal uncertainty regarding the status of the EOGRTS under REACH.   The cases where no unanimous agreement of the MSC was reached willl be referred by ECHA to the Commission for decision making.

Companies should act now if they are affected by the withdrawal. Helsinki, 5 November 2020 – ECHA has updated its IT tools and dedicated web section on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU including Q&As with advice to companies. The transition period of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU ends on 31 December 2020, and the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland starts to apply from 1 January 2021. REACH, CLP, the BPR, PIC and POPs will continue to apply in Northern Ireland (UK(NI)) after the transition period, but will no longer apply in the rest of the UK (UK(GB)). Downstream users in the EU/EEA should check the list of substances registered only by UK companies on ECHA’s website to see if they need to take action before the end of the transition period. If they plan to get their supply from the UK(GB) after the end of the transition period, they should register the substance themselves as an importer, unless the registration has been transferred to the EU/EEA. REACH registrations made by UK(GB)-based manufacturers, importers and only representatives will become void if they are not transferred to the EU/EEA before the end of the transition period. Companies are, therefore, urged to act now and not wait until the last minute. EU/EEA companies will need to submit their own Poison Centre notifications through the ECHA Submission Portal before they import mixtures from the UK(GB). They cannot rely on submissions previously made by UK(GB) suppliers. Previously submitted notifications by UK(NI) companies will remain in the database and be available to relevant EU/EEA authorities. UK(NI) companies can continue to submit notifications through the ECHA Submission Portal to EU/EEA authorities. However, a new legal entity must first be created. Notifications to the UK(NI) market area will not be possible through the ECHA Submission Portal and must be submitted directly to UK authorities. Product authorisations held by companies based in the UK(GB) under the Biocidal Products Regulation will need to be transferred to a new authorisation holder within the EU/EEA by the end of the transition period. Furthermore, companies based in the EU and UK(NI) can now submit PIC export notifications in ePIC for non-EU countries, including UK(GB), taking place as of 1 January 2021.

Most of the products are expected to be consumer products. Helsinki, 1 July 2020 – Inspectors will check that the products comply with restrictions for selected hazardous substances under REACH. The controls will also check whether products comply with restrictions for the presence of persistent organic pollutants defined under the POPs Regulation. Specific substances to be covered by these checks will be decided in 2021 and could potentially include for example phthalates or PFOS. Enforcers will also check REACH duties for substances in articles requiring that information on substances of very high concern in products is being communicated in the supply chain. These duties under REACH and POPs will be checked for specific types of material such as rubber, plastic or textiles. In this way each product can be controlled for several REACH or POPs requirements which will broaden the scope of controls and strengthening the protection of EU citizens and the environment. This enforcement project will be prepared in 2021, with inspections conducted in 2022 and the report expected at the end of 2023. The Forum also set timelines for the pilot project on the classification of mixtures, which will focus on classification of detergents and cleaning products. The preparation for this project will start at the end of 2020, with inspections taking place in 2021 and 2022 and the report expected in 2023.

Helsinki, 7 December 2012 – SEAC's opinion is based on the June Committee for Risk Assessment opinion (RAC) which said that the available data does not indicate a current risk from combined exposure to the four phthalates. The SEAC opinion therefore confirms its draft opinion of June 2012. The draft opinion was submitted for public consultation for 60 days. Based on the ten comments received, SEAC did not consider it necessary to change its opinion. However, it has introduced a number of clarifications in the justification text of the opinion. The original restriction proposal was submitted in 2011 by the Danish competent authorities with the aim of limiting the combined exposure of humans through consumer articles to the four phthalates. Draft opinion on restriction proposal for Chromium VI in leather articles Following the recent RAC opinion in support of the Danish proposal to restrict Chromium VI in leather articles, SEAC now also concluded that the proposed restriction is the most appropriate Community wide measure to address the identified risks in terms of the proportionality of its socio-economic benefits to its socio-economic costs provided that the scope and conditions are modified as stated in the RAC opinion. Public consultation on the SEAC draft opinion will be launched in December and the Committee is expected to adopt its final opinion in March 2013. Further information SEAC web pages Translations"
5,ECHA_NEWS_0042,2020-12-09,6.5 % of inspected substances miss the required registration,"6.5 % of inspected substances miss the required registration ECHA/NR/20/40 An EU-wide REACH enforcement project has also found that 15 % of almost 1 200 chemicals needing registration did not comply with at least one registration-related duty. Helsinki, 10 December 2020 – ECHA Forum’s seventh REACH enforcement project checked how well companies comply with registration obligations after the last registration deadline of 31 May 2018. In addition, enforcement authorities from 28 EEA countries checked if substances registered as intermediates met the definition and if they were used under strictly controlled conditions. A valid registration was completely missing for 77 out of 1 193 (6.5 %) inspected substances needing a registration. 180 (15 %) of the substances were non-compliant with at least one of the registration-related obligations checked in the scope of the project. This includes the duty to register but also, for example, the duty to update the dossier, use intermediates under strictly controlled conditions, submit correct tonnage information or comply with requirements for only representatives. Inspectors also checked if companies had systems in place to ensure that they update their registration in a timely manner. Fewer than half of the companies inspected had a system in place to track and manage changes in tonnage bands (46 %) and uses (39 %) of the substances they registered. Checks related to substances registered as isolated intermediates showed that 85 % were intermediates as defined by REACH and 80 % of checked companies managed them under strictly controlled conditions as required by the regulation. Imported substances were also controlled as part of the project, with enforcement authorities cooperating closely with customs. When inspectors found companies breaching any of the duties checked in the project, they took enforcement measures to address the non-compliance. Written advice and administrative orders were the most frequent measures used. Fines, administrative orders and, in some cases, referrals for criminal prosecution were issued by inspectors to companies who failed to register substances. Based on these findings, the Forum has made several recommendations to companies such as to regularly verify their compliance with registration duties and to keep registration dossiers updated and synchronised with actual company operations, for example through appropriate tracking systems to monitor quantities and uses. Background The REACH-EN-FORCE-7 (REF-7) project is the latest in a series of three Forum enforcement projects focusing on registration duties after a registration deadline. The first two projects were finalised in 2010 (REF-1) and 2014 (REF-3). Inspections for REF-7 targeted manufacturers, importers and only representatives with an obligation to register at least one chemical. The scope included all sectors of industry and all company sizes. The inspections took place during 2019. The checks were carried out in 813 companies in the EEA. Out of the 1 420 substances inspected during the project, 227 were exempt from registration. So, registration duties were checked for 1 193 substances. As some of the substances were registered jointly by several companies, the inspections covered 952 different substances in total. More than two thirds (71 %) of the checked substances were classified as hazardous according to the CLP Regulation. An intermediate is defined as a substance that is manufactured for chemical processing to be transformed into another substance.

A valid registration was completely missing for 77 out of 1 193 (6.5 %) inspected substances needing a registration. 180 (15 %) of the substances were non-compliant with at least one of the registration-related obligations checked in the scope of the project. This includes the duty to register but also, for example, the duty to update the dossier, use intermediates under strictly controlled conditions, submit correct tonnage information or comply with requirements for only representatives. Inspectors also checked if companies had systems in place to ensure that they update their registration in a timely manner. Fewer than half of the companies inspected had a system in place to track and manage changes in tonnage bands (46 %) and uses (39 %) of the substances they registered. Checks related to substances registered as isolated intermediates showed that 85 % were intermediates as defined by REACH and 80 % of checked companies managed them under strictly controlled conditions as required by the regulation. Imported substances were also controlled as part of the project, with enforcement authorities cooperating closely with customs. When inspectors found companies breaching any of the duties checked in the project, they took enforcement measures to address the non-compliance. Written advice and administrative orders were the most frequent measures used. Fines, administrative orders and, in some cases, referrals for criminal prosecution were issued by inspectors to companies who failed to register substances. Based on these findings, the Forum has made several recommendations to companies such as to regularly verify their compliance with registration duties and to keep registration dossiers updated and synchronised with actual company operations, for example through appropriate tracking systems to monitor quantities and uses. Background The REACH-EN-FORCE-7 (REF-7) project is the latest in a series of three Forum enforcement projects focusing on registration duties after a registration deadline. The first two projects were finalised in 2010 (REF-1) and 2014 (REF-3). Inspections for REF-7 targeted manufacturers, importers and only representatives with an obligation to register at least one chemical. The scope included all sectors of industry and all company sizes. The inspections took place during 2019. The checks were carried out in 813 companies in the EEA. Out of the 1 420 substances inspected during the project, 227 were exempt from registration. So, registration duties were checked for 1 193 substances. As some of the substances were registered jointly by several companies, the inspections covered 952 different substances in total. More than two thirds (71 %) of the checked substances were classified as hazardous according to the CLP Regulation. An intermediate is defined as a substance that is manufactured for chemical processing to be transformed into another substance.

RAC agreed with the proposal from Austria to classify cymoxanil as acutely toxic through the oral route, sensitising to skin, toxic after repeated exposure and as a developmental toxicant. RAC also agreed that the substance should be classified as a reproductive toxicant for effects on fertility. In relation to the environment, RAC agreed with the proposal from Austria to classify cymoxanil as very toxic to the aquatic environment with long-lasting effects.  Cymoxanil is used as a fungicide. 4-vinylcyclohexene (VCH) The classification and labelling of this substance had so far not been harmonised at EU level. RAC agreed with the proposal from France to classify 4-vinylcyclohexene as a substance suspected of causing cancer in humans. 4-Vinylcyclohexene is used in the production of flame retardants, flavours, fragrances and other chemicals and as a solvent. Fenoxycarb The classification and labelling of this substance had so far not been harmonised at EU level. RAC agreed with the proposal from Germany to classify fenoxycarb as a substance suspected of causing cancer in humans and as very toxic to the aquatic environment with acute and long-lasting effects. Fenoxycarb is used as an insecticide. Tralkoxydim The classification and labelling of this substance had so far not been harmonised at EU level. RAC agreed with the proposal from the United Kingdom to classify tralkoxydim as acutely toxic through the oral route, as a substance suspected of causing cancer in humans and as toxic to the aquatic life with long-lasting effects. RAC did not agree with the proposal from the UK to classify tralkoxydim as toxic after repeated exposure. Tralkoxydim is used as a herbicide. Penconazole The classification and labelling of this substance had so far not been harmonised at EU level.  RAC agreed with the proposal from Germany to classify penconazole as acutely toxic through the oral route and toxic to the aquatic life with long lasting effects. RAC also agreed to classify penconazole as a reproductive toxicant for effects on development. Penconazole is used as a fungicide.   Background Information The role of RAC in EU regulatory processes RAC is responsible for preparing the opinion of the Agency on applications for authorisation, proposals for restrictions and proposals for harmonised classification and labelling. RAC also prepares opinions on specific questions relating to risks of chemicals to human health or the environment and on any other aspects concerning the safety of substances at the Executive Director's request. The final decision for proposals for harmonised classification and labelling, for proposals for restrictions as well as on applications for authorisation will be taken by the European Commission through a committee procedure.   Further information The opinions will be available at the following link in the near future: http://echa.europa.eu/opinions-of-the-committee-for-risk-assessment-on-proposals-for-harmonised-classification-and-labelling   Further information about RAC is available on the ECHA website at the link below: http://echa.europa.eu/about-us/who-we-are/committee-for-risk-assessment"

If registrants have new relevant information, they need to submit it through their comments to the draft decision. Helsinki, 31 March 2020 - From 14 April 2020, ECHA starts applying a new policy regarding dossier updates during substance evaluation. After ECHA has sent registrants a draft decision for commenting, the Agency and evaluating Member States no longer take dossier updates into account in their decision making. This is because registration dossiers must reflect the best knowledge of the registrants at all times and contain the most up-to-date information, in particular on the exposure and use of the substance. If registrants have new relevant information on their substance after receiving a draft decision, they will need to submit it through their comments to the draft decision. Authorities will consider the comments and amend the draft decision, if needed. The same approach already applies to dossier evaluation.

Helsinki, 4 September 2017 – A report, commissioned by ECHA, examines the challenges and incentives for updating REACH and CLP dossiers and identifies best practice that could help companies improve their data. As the main issues affecting companies responsible for updating their information, it mentions the perception that registration is the end of the process and that no additional work is needed afterwards; obscurity of what needs to be updated, when and by whom; and limited resources, especially for SMEs. The report proposes improvements structured around four steps: A clear definition of what needs to be updated. A clear definition of who is responsible for the updates – clarifying the roles of the lead and co-registrants. An improved understanding of why updates are important – that they have an impact on protecting the human health and the environment. An Implementing Act to clarify the update requirement of Article 22 of REACH, including clear circumstances and fixed intervals when dossiers need to be updated. The recommended actions are addressed to ECHA, the trade associations and the policy makers. The report has been sent to the European Commission for their consideration under the REACH Review expected to be finalised by the end of the year. Background The REACH and CLP regulations require companies to update their information whenever new information is available. Article 22 of REACH specifies a number of “further duties of registrants”. These can be divided into those that registrants are expected to do spontaneously under their own initiative and those required by ECHA during the evaluation process. Around 64 % of the registration dossiers submitted to ECHA since 2008 have never been updated. Further information The study was carried out by Amec Foster Wheeler Environment and Infrastructure UK Limited in association with Peter Fisk Associates Limited. It does not represent the views or position of ECHA. It is part of ECHA’s efforts to maximise the availability of high quality data to enable the safe manufacture and use of chemicals.   Study report [EN] [PDF] Phase 7 of REACH 2018: Keep your registration up-to-date"

The cross-country analysis and added country profiles aim to improve understanding into the focus and prioritisation of environmental action countries are taking across Europe. Key Findings:  Approximately 90 % of EEA member and cooperating countries have some form of focused action related to SDG 6 (water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (life on land). Due to national circumstances, priorities and context, there is some overall convergence and divergence as to where countries put their SDG efforts. For some SDGs, there is convergence in the types of action within the individual SDGs adopted in Eionet countries, like for example on SDG 7, the type of action includes energy efficiency in 77 % of EEA and cooperating countries. Other SDGs show a greater divergence and even innovative approaches in actions by countries, which is likely to reflect the influence of different contexts (e.g. geography and climate influencing water availability) and policy priorities on countries’ choices as to what to focus on. Multi-level and inclusive governance is commonly used for SDG action in Eionet countries; inter-ministerial bodies, advisory councils, commissions or working groups to coordinate SDG action have been established in almost 75 % of Eionet countries; and dialogue with stakeholders and their participation in prioritisation, decision-making and SDG action is evident in over 80 % of countries.   Background The EEA analysis is based on a mapping and analysis of EEA member and cooperating countries; environmental SDG action and procedures and it contributes to the EU’s SDG monitoring report. Agreed by world leaders at the United Nations in 2015, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which address global challenges, including poverty, inequality, environmental degradation and climate change. The EU was instrumental in shaping the 2030 Agenda and, together with its Member States, has the ambition to play a leading role in the global action towards achieving the SDGs. The EU has adopted a strategic approach to integrating the SDGs in both internal and external policies, and has developed indicators and a stakeholder platform to support SDG action. As described in the EEA’s ‘European environment — state and outlook 2020 (SOER 2020)’ report, 11 SDGs have been characterized with important environmental dimensions."
30288,EEA_NEWS_0780,2005-09-13,Environmental effect on diseases could be underestimated,"The current way of analysing connections between environment and health attributes only 2-5% of European mortality and morbidity to environmental factors. However, this so-called ""burden of disease"" approach is likely to be flawed, according to EEA executive director Professor Jacqueline McGlade who spoke today at the 2005 conference of the UK Health Protection Agency at Warwick University. In her speech, Jacqueline McGlade noted that multi-causality and complexity were often neglected in research looking at connections between environment and health. This is due in part to the sheer complexity of these realities. 'Research however needed to address these complexities if it was to be realistic,' said. Jacqueline McGlade. She went on to add that the EEA planned to do further work on multi-causality and the burden of disease over the next two years in partnership with the JRC. In her presentation, she also said that the EEA, as a follow-up study to its widely read and quoted report on the precautionary principle, would address the issues of how to calculate the cost and the benefits of action or inaction when faced with an environmental problem. The new report on the precautionary principle due out in 2007 will comprise 16 case studies. The case studies will cover issues, such as lead in petrol and climate change, and will address in particular how science is generated, financed, communicated, used and sometimes misused. It will also look at what lessons can be drawn from overreacting to weak and sometimes mistaken signals.

30177,EEA_NEWS_0669,2008-04-30,Concentrations of air pollutants constant despite drop in emissions,"The report, Air pollution in Europe, analyses air pollutant emissions and their possible health and ecosystem impacts in Europe between 1990–2004. Man-made emissions of all air pollutants fell substantially in the 32 EEA member countries the report says. This was mainly due to the effectiveness of EU policies limiting air pollution from the power/heat generation sector, industry and from road transport. However, measured concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and ozone, have not generally shown any improvement since 1997. Particulate matter Particulate matter is an umbrella term for a 'basket' of potentially harmful chemical components that form particles in the air including: organic chemicals, acid aerosols, trace metals, sea salts and windborne soil dust. Because of their small size the particles are easily inhaled by humans and have a damaging effect on health. Exposure to PM can shorten life expectancy and increase the numbers of premature deaths, hospital admissions and emergency room visits (e.g. respiratory diseases, increased risk of heart attack). Fine particulate matter, with a diameter size below 2.5 micrometer (PM2.5), is now generally recognised to be the main threat to human health from air pollution. Ozone Ozone (O3) is formed in the ground-level atmosphere by reaction between NOX and volatile organic compounds in the presence of heat and sunlight. Ozone pollution is thus a major concern during the summer months. If inhaled by humans, ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. Possible causes of high PM and ozone levels High PM and ozone levels in the air, as observed in 2003, can also partly be explained by weather conditions, the report says. Reduced precipitation, high springtime temperatures and stable atmospheric conditions (all conditions which occurred in 2003) lead to higher pollutant concentrations in the air. Other causes of this phenomenon could include additional pollution coming from natural sources and pollution transported from countries outside Europe, the report says. Key points of the report Estimates indicate that up to 43 % of the European urban population were exposed to PM10 concentrations in excess of the EU air quality limit value between 1990–2004. The worst affected areas were Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary as well as in the Po Valley in Italy and southern Spain. Up to 60 % of the European urban population was exposed to ozone concentrations in excess of the EU air quality limit values between 1990–2004. Exposure of crops and forests to ozone exceeded limit/critical values over very large areas of central and southern Europe. Human exposure to certain other potentially harmful air pollutants, sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and lead, has decreased markedly due to effective European air quality policies. This is particularly true with policies reducing emissions of SO2 from power and heat generation as well as CO and lead emissions from passenger cars.

30034,EEA_NEWS_0526,2010-10-11,Deep emission cuts give the EU a head start under the Kyoto Protocol,"We cannot afford to wait until after the end of the Kyoto period to start implementing policies targeting sectors not covered by the EU ETS, such as transport and residential heating. These sectors are crucial for the EU targets set for 2020. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of EEA The EEA report 'Tracking progress towards Kyoto and 2020 targets' presents an overview of the progress actually seen in 2008 (and 2009 where data are available) in European countries towards their respective targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Based on aggregated emission projections at EU level, the report also presents an assessment of projected progress of the EU-15 towards its 8 % reduction commitment and of the EU-27 towards its 20 % reduction target by 2020. 'We cannot afford to wait until after the end of the Kyoto period to start implementing policies targeting sectors not covered by the EU ETS, such as transport and residential heating. These sectors are crucial for the EU targets set for 2020,' said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. Key findings When looking at 2008 and 2009, the two first years of the Kyoto commitment period, the EU-15 appears to be well on track towards achieving its commitment of reducing emissions by 8 % compared to base-year levels. Together, the EU-15 countries are estimated to have reduced their average annual emissions over these two years by more than 250 million tonnes CO2 equivalent beyond the reductions needed for achieving their common Kyoto target. This puts EU-15 collectively 5.9 % below the 8 % Kyoto reduction target.  The figures take into account the planned use of the Kyoto Protocol’s flexible mechanisms by governments (2.7 % of base-year emissions) and the expected sequestration of atmospheric carbon due to forestry activities (1.0 % of base-year emissions). However, failure by any EU-15 Member State to achieve its own burden-sharing target could jeopardize the possibility for the EU-15 to achieve its common target.  Current emission levels and projections show that the EU is well on track towards achieving its 2020 reduction target of 20 % with emission reductions achieved in the EU territories only, provided that Member States fully implement the Climate and Energy package adopted in 2009. Recent estimates by the EEA also confirm this downward trend, with the EU-27’s 2009 emissions expected to stand 17.3 % below their 1990 level. Based on their 2008 emission levels, almost all European countries with a Kyoto target were on track to meet their individual targets. However, three EU Member States (Austria, Denmark and Italy), two other EEA countries (Liechtenstein and Switzerland) and one EU candidate country (Croatia) need to step up their efforts before 2012 to be able to meet their targets.Because the allocation of emission allowances to the EU ETS is already decided upon for the full period 2008–2012, reducing emissions in the sectors not covered by the EU ETS – such as transport, residential heating, agriculture or waste – are necessary for achieving the Kyoto targets. The economic crisis largely contributed to the drop in total EU-27 greenhouse gas emissions in 2009 compared to 2008 (by 6.9 % according to EEA estimates), but its impact was felt less significantly in the sectors not included in the EU ETS (– 3.3%) than in the sectors included (– 11.7 %). Return to economic growth could temporarily level off or even reverse the decline in emissions, but the declining trend is expected to continue. Notes to the editor The EEA report 'Tracking progress towards Kyoto and 2020 targets' can be found at http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/progress-towards-kyoto/. The European Commission also publishes a report today assessing the EU's progress towards the Kyoto commitments, which takes into account actual emissions and projections to the end of the 2008-2012 commitment period, whereas the EEA report is based on actual emissions in 2008 (and 2009 where data are available). As such, the two reports complement each other. The EEA's report will be followed later in the year by an in-depth analysis of the links between historic emission trends and the policies and measures implemented in the EU. Background on EU emission reduction commitments Under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU-15 has a common commitment to reduce emissions on average by 8 % between 2008 and 2012 compared to emissions in the 'base year' (mostly 1990). Unlike the EU-15, the EU-27 does not have a common target under the Kyoto Protocol and therefore the EU-27 does not have an applicable base year against which to compare emission changes. Emission changes compared to 1990 are relevant for the EU-27 as it has made a unilateral commitment to achieve at least a 20 % reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990.

29993,EEA_NEWS_0485,2011-08-29,Big potential of cutting greenhouse gases from waste,"Biodegradable waste sent to landfill produces methane when the organic material decomposes anaerobically. Although this potent GHG can be captured and used to generate energy, much of it escapes into the atmosphere where it has a powerful climate forcing effect. Reducing the amount of waste going to landfill is therefore an important objective of EU waste policies. Nonetheless, waste volumes continue to rise across the EU. The average EU citizen generated 468 kg of municipal solid waste in 1995, which increased to 524 kg in 2008. This could rise to 558 kg per person by 2020 unless effective policies are put in place to reduce waste generation. The report takes a ‘life-cycle approach’ to calculating emissions from waste, considering all direct emissions from waste during processing and transport. In addition, it also accounts for emissions that are avoided in other parts of the economy – for example, accounting for the reduction of emissions when fossil fuels are displaced by energy recovered from waste. In this way, the method can show the potential impacts of various waste management strategies. Especially recycling leads to avoided emissions. This is because recycling materials from municipal waste avoids emissions that would have been generated in extracting and processing virgin raw materials and these avoided emissions are higher than the emissions caused by the recycling processes. More details on the calculations, assumptions and data are available in this working paper.  Three different scenarios for 2020 illustrate that the potential for GHG savings largely depends on how countries implement EU waste policies, in particular whether they meet the EU Landfill Directive targets to reduce landfill of biodegradable municipal waste. Key findings from three different scenarios In a business-as-usual scenario, net GHG emissions from municipal waste management would be cut by 44 million tonnes CO2-e until 2020 compared to 2008. The two main factors responsible for this improvement are reduced methane emissions from landfill and increased avoided emissions through recycling. If all countries fully meet the Landfill Directive’s waste diversion targets, potential life-cycle GHG emissions from municipal waste management in 2020 could be cut by 62 million tonnes CO2-e, which equals 1.23 % of their total GHG emissions in 2008. A complete ban on landfilling could cut emissions even further, reducing potential net emissions from waste management in 2020 by 78 million tonnes CO2-e compared to 2008. For the sake of comparison, this is more than Hungary’s total emissions in 2008.   An analysis by the OECD , following a somewhat different but also life-cycle based approach, broadly confirms the findings of the EEA work, namely, that better management of municipal waste has a significant potential to reduce GHG emissions. Encouragingly, ever more municipal solid waste is recycled and less is landfilled. The EU recycled 17 % of its municipal solid waste in 1995 and 40 % in 2008. In that period, the amount going to landfill dropped from 68 % to 40 %. These improvements have already cut annual net GHG emissions by 48 million tonnes CO2-e between 1995 and 2008 in the EU-27, Norway and Switzerland. Kitchen and garden waste is the biggest fraction of municipal solid waste in most EU countries. This represents a sizeable opportunity to cut emissions through recycling and energy recovery – in 2008, 44 million tonnes of organic matter was composted, emitting 1.4 million tonnes CO2-e. If that had been subjected to anaerobic digestion, producing useful biogas, it could have cut 2 million tonnes CO2-e from Europe’s emissions. In addition to climate concerns, increasing recycling and energy recovery also enhances resource efficiency, a main goal of the EU2020 strategy. However, even the most effective waste management strategy generates GHGs and causes the loss of resources. Authors note that the best strategy is avoiding generating waste in the first place.   Links Waste opportunities – Past and future climate benefits from better municipal waste management in Europe The European environment – state and outlook 2010: Synthesis, chapter 4: natural resources and waste Material resources and waste — SOER 2010 thematic assessment SOER 2010 country assessments on waste How can waste policy contribute to a resource-efficient economy?

Urgent action needed to protect Europe's damaged soils Bonn, 19 December 2000 -- The degradation of Europe's vital soil resources will continue and even accelerate unless prompt action is taken now, according to a new report by the European Environment Agency and the United Nations Environment Programme. ""The sustainable use of soils is one of Europe's greatest environmental, social and economic challenges,"" said Klaus Töpfer, UNEP's Executive Director. ""Although often overlooked, soil is a natural resource that is no less important to human well-being and the environment than clean water and clean air."" The report, ""Down to earth: Soil degradation and sustainable development in Europe: A challenge for the XXI century,"" is being released here today on the margins of the annual meeting of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. The 32-page report outlines and quantifies the threats to Europe's soils and proposes solutions. ""Soil degradation is part of the systematic abuse of the European space, its territory and the natural resources involved,"" said Domingo Jiménez-Beltrán, the European Environment Agency's Executive Director. ""This may become, in particular in the EU area, a main challenge for sustainability and would require a common approach."" Soil provides a large number of different services which we depend on and which we often are unaware of until it is too late. Soils are being over-stressed by Europe's dense settlement patterns and intensive economic activities and by acidification, erosion, contamination, and changes in climate. Growing demand for food production, living space, leisure and tourism facilities, infrastructure and industrial production will only increase the pressure. In some parts of Europe, the degradation is so severe that it has reduced the soil's capacity to support human communities and ecosystems and resulted in desertification. Because it can take hundreds or thousands of years to regenerate most soils, the damage occurring today is for all purposes irreversible. And soil degradation is not only occurring in the Mediterranean countries (Annex IV of the UN Convention on Desertification). While 1/3 of Europe's soil (EEA 1999) may be affected (with over 150 M ha suffering high erosion risk (EEA 1998)) and deterioration is critical in the Mediterranean countries (e.g. Spain: 18% of land affected; loss of 28 t/ha/y peak average for 90-95 in agricultural land) and around the Black Sea (e.g. Ukraine 41% of agricultural land affected by erosion risk in 1996), it also seriously affects Central Europe (Germany was losing due to sealing 120 ha/day in 1997, Austria's agricultural land lost reached 9 t/ha/y (EEA 1999)) and countries like Ireland and Iceland; and it is expected that water erosion risks will increase by 2050 in 80% of EU's agricultural land.

29770,EEA_NEWS_0262,2015-09-16,Europe continues to phase out ozone layer-damaging chemicals,"Over the last few decades, chemicals known to harm the ozone layer have been successfully substituted in most parts of the world since 1989 when the Montreal Protocol came into force. Within the EU, ozone depleting substances (ODS) are covered by the ODS Regulation, which is more stringent than the rules of the Protocol and covers additional substances. Companies are obliged to report their use of ODS, including imports, exports, production and destruction. The EU has implemented the phase-out of ODS use in line with the Montreal Protocol requirements over the period 1987-2010, which is 10 years ahead of the legal provision. The key metric under the Protocol to measure the use is ‘consumption’. It is calculated from the reported data on production, import, export and destruction. The EEA report 'Ozone depleting substances 2014' shows that consumption in the EU was negative in 2014, as was the general trend over the last years.  These negative values are the result of a phase-out in combination with rather high destruction and low stocks. Since the potential to harm the ozone layer varies among substances, the data collected on these chemicals are expressed not only in metric tonnes but also in 'ozone depleting potential' (ODP) tonnes which show quantities in terms of their environmental effects rather than physical weight. The report is published to coincide with the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer. Ozone depleting substances and climate change Many ODS are also potent greenhouse gases. Their phase out has therefore had a significant positive impact on climate change prevention. However, some of the ODS substitutes can equally contribute to climate change. The EEA has recently published a web page, which provides more information on the links between ODS substitutes and climate change.

30465,EEA_NEWS_0962,2001-07-18,EEA reorganises to meet new challenges,"After six years of operation the Agency has decided to reorganise to meet future challenges more effectively. The reorganisation will be implemented over the summer period and completed by 1 September. A new EEA strategy has been developed as part of the preparations for the reorganisation. There are four main reasons for the reorganisation: Enlargement: The EEA will be the first Community body to have the candidate countries as members. Today there are 18 EEA member countries and we expect to welcome 13-14 new member countries in the coming months. The organisation is therefore being extended and adapted to manage the increased number of member countries and the increased workload, larger budget and increase in staff that will result. Adjusting to the new EEA strategy: EEA has analysed the recent changes in Europe's environment policy agenda and revised its strategy to meet the needs of our key clients. The reorganisation takes the new strategy into account. Reform of the European Commission: Developments in the Commission's reform process have been followed closely and the EEA reorganisation reflects these upcoming changes. Evaluation of the EEA: Following the recommendations of an independent evaluation of the Agency conducted last year, the reorganisation aims at better balancing: short, medium and long term developments external relations, EEA management and Group management innovation and routine activities work on products and services EEA development and individual staff development. Furthermore the reorganisation aims to improve communication tools. The reorganisation As shown below, the new organisation will comprise the Executive Director's Office (EDO), Administration and Finance Department (ADM) and four Operational Programmes: Strategic Development and Institutional Relations (SDI), Environmental Assessment (EAS), Reporting and Networking Coordination (RNC) and Information Technology and Services (ITS). The four Operational Programmes will be subdivided where appropriate into Groups based on similar areas of expertise/activity. Line management will be carried out through the Programmes and Programme Managers will delegate some responsibilities to Group leaders. Ad hoc cross-cutting Teams with specific terms of reference will be formed to address specific products and services. An increase in support staff for Groups and Teams is foreseen to improve the Agency's efficiency and effectiveness."

29755,EEA_NEWS_0247,2016-01-27,Explaining vehicle emissions – why do laboratory and road measurements differ?,"Measuring exhaust emissions from vehicles is a complex issue, and it’s a topic that has been extensively discussed in the media over the past months. This report explains in simple terms how vehicle emissions occur and how they are tested, and the reasons for the gap between tested and real-world driving emissions. EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx Despite improvements in vehicle efficiencies over past decades, EEA reports show that the road transport sector is responsible for almost one fifth of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions. It also contributes to high concentrations of air pollutants above EU standards in many of Europe’s cities. ‘Measuring exhaust emissions from vehicles is a complex issue, and it’s a topic that has been extensively discussed in the media over the past months,’ said EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx. ‘This report explains in simple terms how vehicle emissions occur and how they are tested, and the reasons for the gap between tested and real-world driving emissions.’ The new report, ‘Explaining road transport emissions: a non-technical guide’, gives a simplified explanation of the often complex information available on road transport emissions as well as the technologies to reduce them. Standardised measurements are made in laboratories to check that vehicles meet the official requirements for exhaust emissions. However, the official procedures currently used in Europe are not representative of real driving conditions. For certain pollutants, there is a significant difference between official emission measurements and vehicle performance on the road. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), a major air pollutant which harms health and the environment, can be more than seven times higher under real world driving conditions for new vehicles than in official tests. New vehicles similarly can emit up to 40 % more carbon dioxide (CO2) than official measurements would indicate. The report outlines three main reasons for these discrepancies: An outdated test procedure used in Europe that does not reflect real-world driving conditions; Permitted ‘flexibilities’ in the current testing procedures that allow manufacturers to optimise certain testing conditions, and thereby achieve lower fuel consumption and CO2 emission values; Several in-use factors which are driver dependent (e.g. driving style) or independent (e.g. environmental conditions) The existing emissions test procedure permits a number of flexibilities which can be used to minimise measured emissions. In the future two important initiatives are planned in the European Union to help ensure an improved consistency between the official vehicle emissions and real-world driving performance. This includes updating the outdated official test procedure to one that is more representative of real-world emissions, as well as the introduction of a procedure for measuring the real driving NOx emissions of vehicles on the road."

29572,EEA_NEWS_0064,2020-07-02,Connecting protected areas with green infrastructure would strengthen Europe’s ecosystems,"The EEA briefing ‘Building a Trans-European Nature Network’ analyses the potential of using green infrastructure to connect protected Natura 2000 sites with other natural and semi-natural landscapes. Green infrastructure networks consist of natural and man-made green structures, such as forests, parks, wildlife overpasses or hedgerows, and they are designed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services, including as water and air purification, space for recreation and climate mitigation and adaptation. According to the EEA briefing, about 80 % of the current Natura 2000 sites are already connected through natural or semi-natural areas. Around 15 % of the disconnected Natura 2000 sites are less than 1 kilometre apart but intersected by, for example, highways, agricultural land, or urban areas that limit species movement and the area’s capacity to offer ecosystem services. Connecting nature sites with green infrastructure could boost ecosystem services by about 10 % within the protected network and in its surrounding areas. These benefits could be expanded by connecting EU sites with neighbouring regions, which could done with little or very little management intervention, the EEA briefing states. The EEA briefing is based on a technical report developed by the EEA and its European Topic Centre on Urban, Land and Soil Systems. This work contributes to approaches to extending the network of protected areas to meet the 30 % target of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, which calls for investments in green and blue infrastructure and cooperation across borders to set up ecological corridors."
30198,EEA_NEWS_0690,2008-02-25,"Time to step up efforts towards sustainable consumption and production, says a new report","The recommendations of the event have now been published: the report 'Time for action — towards sustainable consumption and production in Europe', launched today, is the result of a joint initiative of the EEA, the Slovenian Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning and the UNEP/Wuppertal Institute Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP). The upcoming EU Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) — possibly combined with an Action Plan on Sustainable Industrial Policies — should include 'clear sustainability targets' according to the recommendations developed by the participants of the conference. Concrete steps to get the prices right and a directive on green public procurement were additional top-priority recommendations identified by the experts ahead of the EU Action Plan. Internalising costs through environmental fiscal reforms, identifying models and examples of sustainable living and developing long term visions of sustainable consumption and production were the top-priority recommendations identified for national authorities, in cooperation with business and civil society. At the global level, participants advocated for the United Nations within its Marrakech Process (1) to encourage national governments to integrate sustainable consumption and production objectives into ministries beyond environment. The conference also singled out the need to develop a world-wide communication strategy to promote sustainable consumption and production and to involve also private financial institutions. The EEA is already making its contribution: responding to the recommendations, the Agency is for example assessing worldwide impacts from consumption in Europe through integrated economic and environmental accounting, identifying indicators of sustainable consumption and production, and analysing the factors driving consumption change. Note The 'Marrakech Process' is a global UN initiative to support regional and national actions to promote the shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns.

16778,EMA_PR_0893,2010-05-25,EudraVigilance signal detection methods help detect drug safety issues earlier,"Adding EudraVigilance statistical signal detection methods to routine drug safety monitoring methods leads to earlier detection of safety issuesAn evaluation of the use of the European Medicines Agency's statistical signal detection method in the adverse drug reaction data collected in the EudraVigilance database has shown a significantly earlier detection of drug safety issues in about 54% of cases where a clinically important adverse drug reaction report was found (compared to 'routine' pharmacovigilance).The study which was published in Drug Safety, the journal of the International Society of Pharmacovigilance, was carried out by the European Medicines Agency and was conducted in relation to centrally authorised medicines. It provides direct evidence for a strong additive role of Eudravigilance signal detection methods. The study also underlines the importance of established pharmacovigilance systems, such as active surveillance, clinical trials or periodic safety update reporting, and concludes that a combination of routine pharmacovigilance and statistical signal detection provides the optimal safety monitoring with earlier detection and better management of safety issues, thereby improving the protection of public health.EudraVigilance is the European Union database for adverse drug reaction reports. It provides a single repository for all spontaneous reports of suspected serious adverse reactions concerning medicines that are authorised in the European Union received via the national competent authorities for medicines regulation and the pharmaceutical industry.While the study looked at statistical signal detection retrospectively, the European Medicines Agency is now routinely using the statistical signal detection method to strengthen signal detection for centrally authorised medicines. By detecting new or changing safety issues with medicines earlier, action can be taken more quickly to reduce the risk to the public. This is one important way in which EudraVigilance makes a contribution to the health of EU citizens through reducing the suffering caused by adverse reactions.The development of EudraVigilance and the use of statistical signal detection methods is an essential part of the European Risk Management Strategy (ERMS), a multi-annual programme aiming to provide for a more proactive conduct of pharmacovigilance by putting in place measures that allow for the early detection, assessment, minimisation and communication of risks of medicines in Europe throughout their lifecycle.The Agency's commitment to the continuous improvement of the safety monitoring of medicines is also underlined by its central coordinating role in PROTECT, a project of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), which is aimed at strengthening the monitoring of the benefits and risks of medicines in Europe by developing innovative tools and methods that will enhance the early detection and assessment of adverse drug reactions.NotesThe reference for the study is: Alvarez Y., Hidalgo A., Maignen F., Slattery J., 2010.

Ltd at its site in Mumbai, India. This follows a good clinical practice (GCP) inspection which raised concerns about the study data used to support marketing authorisation applications of some medicines in the EU.The Committee also started a review of the cancer medicine Yondelis (trabectedin), used to treat ovarian cancer and soft-tissue sarcoma (a type of cancer that develops from the soft, supporting tissues of the body). The review started after a clinical study (OVC-3006) investigating the use of Yondelis in patients with ovarian cancer was stopped ahead of time, because an interim analysis of the results showed that, overall, patients treated with Yondelis plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD, another cancer medicine) did not live longer than patients given PLD alone.For more information, see the start-of-referral documents in the grid below.Withdrawals of applicationsThe application to extend the use of Axumin (fluciclovine (18F)) in the diagnosis and continuing assessment of glioma (a type of brain tumour) was withdrawn.The application for the use of Opdivo (nivolumab) and Yervoy (ipilimumab) in the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that has not been treated previously was also withdrawn.Question-and-answer documents on these withdrawals are available in the grid below.Agenda and minutesThe agenda of the February meeting is published on EMA's website.

16773,EMA_PR_0888,2010-04-23,European Medicines Agency gives new temporary treatment recommendations for Fabrazyme,"Supply shortages for Genzyme's Cerezyme and Fabrazyme to last longer than expectedThe European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has been informed by Genzyme, the manufacturer of Cerezyme (imiglucerase) and Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta), that the supply shortages for these medicines are expected to continue at least until the end of September 2010, because of a new manufacturing problem.Cerezyme and Fabrazyme are both used to treat rare, inherited enzyme-deficiency disorders. Cerezyme is used in patients with Gaucher disease, and Fabrazyme is used in patients with Fabry disease. Temporary treatment recommendations to manage patients relying on these medicines during the ongoing supply shortages have been in place since June 2009 and have been regularly updated.For Cerezyme, the temporary treatment recommendations given on 22 October 2009 are still valid. However, for Fabrazyme, the Committee decided to revise the recommendations made on 25 September 2009, since, based on information supplied by the manufacturer, at least 12% of patients on the reduced Fabrazyme dose regimen have already experienced a worsening of their disease. For such patients, the CHMP recommended that physicians should either consider restarting the original treatment with the full dose of Fabrazyme or switching to an alternative treatment, such as Replagal.Given the new information, the temporary treatment recommendations for Fabrazyme are as follows:Children and adolescents (18 years) should receive Fabrazyme according to the standard dose and frequency of one infusion every two weeks.Adult patients already treated/stabilised may receive Fabrazyme with an adjusted dose of 0.3 mg/kg as maintenance dose every two weeks.All patients, especially those with adjusted dose regimens, should be under close clinical surveillance. A full medical examination, including all relevant clinical parameters, should be performed every two months. It is of the utmost importance to monitor the plasma GL-3 or urinary GL-3 levels, as for the moment the GL-3 level is the most sensitive parameter.For patients on the reduced dose who demonstrate a deterioration of the disease, physicians should consider restarting the original treatment with the full dose of Fabrazyme or switching to an alternative treatment, such as Replagal.These recommendations are temporary and do not change the currently approved product information for Fabrazyme.The new manufacturing problem has occurred at the production site in Allston Landing, in the United States of America, where Cerezyme and Fabrazyme are produced. It relates to a problem with the plant's water system. The defect has now been corrected, but supplies for both medicines will not return to normal before the end of September 2010, according to Genzyme.Because of a series of manufacturing difficulties since June 2009, the CHMP remains concerned about the continued supply shortages of Genzyme's medicines, and is, together with the European network, closely monitoring the situation. Genzyme has been invited to present its manufacturing quality assurance system to the Committee during the May plenary meeting. The Agency will make further updates as appropriate.NotesInitially the supply shortage for Cerezyme and Fabrazyme was caused by the shutting down of Genzyme's production site in Allston Landing, in the United States of America, for the sanitisation of the bioreactors because of a viral contamination.Cerezyme, the temporary treatment recommendations given on 22 October 2009 are still valid.

17718,EMA_PR_1833,2014-06-05,"Ranbaxy, Toansa assessment concluded : no risk to public health","European regulatory authorities have finalised their assessment of reported non-compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) at Ranbaxy Laboratories' manufacturing site in Toansa, India that had led to the suspension of the GMP certificate for the site in the European Union (EU).Although the assessment showed that there were a number of GMP deficiencies at the concerned site, assessment of all available information has reassured European regulators that there has been no risk to public health from these deficiencies.Patients should continue to take their medicines as prescribed by their healthcare professional.European regulators also considered the corrective measures put in place by the company and were satisfied that the measures are sufficient to ensure GMP-compliant manufacture of products at the site. As a consequence, the EU authorities will reinstate the GMP certificate which was suspended in January 2014. The certificate will be re-entered into EudraGMDP, the EU database that contains GMP certificates.The assessment followed an inspection by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which revealed areas of non-compliance with GMP at the site. The European medicines regulatory network responded quickly to the FDA's findings, and sent a team of inspectors from Germany, Ireland and the UK, who were joined by inspectors from Switzerland and Australia to undertake an unannounced international inspection of the site.The GMP inspection concluded that appropriate corrective and preventive measures have been put in place by the manufacturer. The inspection team concluded that there was no evidence that any medicines on the EU market that have an active pharmaceutical ingredient manufactured in Toansa were of unacceptable quality or presented a risk to the health of patients taking them. This conclusion was supported by tests of samples of these medicines, all of which met the correct quality specifications.European regulatory authorities have identified the need to keep the Toansa site under close supervision and this will be done in collaboration with India and other regulatory authorities around the globe.NotesThe Toansa site had been supplying APIs for four centrally authorised medicines – Enyglid (repaglinide), Repaglinide Krka (repaglinide), Repaglinide Teva (repaglinide), and Nevirapine Teva (nevirapine) – and several non-centrally authorised medicines.Two GMP certificates have been issued by EU authorities - one covering active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used in medicines authorised in the EU, and a second certificate covering an intermediate of a finished medicine authorised in the EU.

18818,EMA_NEWS_2933,2020-05-05,Global regulators work towards alignment on policy approaches and regulatory flexibility during COVID-19,"In a high-level meeting on COVID-19 policies, organised by EMA under the umbrella of the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA), international regulators from around the world discussed strategic issues and regulatory approaches to ensure a coordinated response to the pandemic. They stressed the need for alignment on pre- and post-authorisation regulatory requirements to facilitate the rapid development, evaluation and availability of medicines for the treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease.The participants focused on regulatory considerations and challenges related to the development of medicines and vaccines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. They raised concerns about multiple small, rather than large clinical trials and stressed the need for the development of priority criteria for planned trials. In addition, they called for the inclusion of vulnerable or neglected populations, such as pregnant women, children and elderly people in COVID-19 studies. The regulators reiterated that it is crucial to align on common study protocols to ensure that the results meet regulatory requirements and allow the evidence to be used to support the approval of medicines or vaccines.  Regulators also discussed the development, evaluation and use of diagnostic tests in the fight against coronavirus disease. They shared insights into diagnostic accuracy and reliability of serological tests for COVID-19 used in different countries. Meeting participants agreed to make, in collaboration with the World Health Organization, an ICMRA inventory of approved tests for COVID-19 to ensure a comparability of the results and to align regulatory approaches.In the context of the pandemic, international regulators have implemented various extraordinary measures to mitigate supply issues with medicines used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. For instance, EMA shared information on  the work of the EU Executive Steering Group on Shortages of Medicines Caused by Major Events, which provides strategic leadership for urgent and coordinated action on shortages within the European Union and has launched the iSPOC (industry single point of contact) system to fast-track information exchange on shortages since April. In addition, EMA presented the guidance on adaptations to the regulatory framework to address challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that has been jointly developed by the European Commission, EMA and the European medicines regulatory network. Other ICMRA members also presented similar policies. All participants committed to continue the exchange of information on high-level regulatory flexibilities to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory decision-making during the current pandemic.The discussion was moderated by Guido Rasi, Chair of ICMRA and EMA’s Executive Director. This was the second in a series of bi-weekly ICMRA meetings organised to allow medicine regulators worldwide to exchange information and build synergies for expediting COVID-19 medicine and vaccine development and approval and for preventing and mitigating medicine shortages. These strategic discussions build on the knowledge and experience gained from the series of ICMRA workshops on COVID-19 medicine development held in March and April 2020. EMA and FDA are taking it in turns to chair these meetings.NoteSerological tests detect antibodies or antibody-like substances in the blood that appear when the body is responding to certain diseases."

17331,EMA_PR_1446,2013-01-18,"European Medicines Agency confirms recommendation to suspend Tredaptive, Pelzont and Trevaclyn","Doctors should no longer prescribe these medicines and should review patients' treatment optionsThe European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has confirmed the recommendation to suspend the marketing authorisations of Tredaptive, Pelzont and Trevaclyn (nicotinic acid / laropiprant) used to treat adults with dyslipidaemia (abnormally high blood levels of fats such as triglycerides and cholesterol). The CHMP decision follows the recent recommendation by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) to suspend these medicines.In the meantime, the European Commission has taken temporary measures to suspend the marketing authorisation and supply of the medicines across the European Union (EU) and the marketing authorisation holder, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, has announced that it is taking steps to suspend availability of the medicines across the EU.The CHMP encourages patients currently taking these medicines to make a non-urgent appointment with their doctor to discuss their treatment. Doctors should no longer prescribe Tredaptive, Pelzont or Trevaclyn and should review patients' treatment options.The review of Tredaptive, Pelzont and Trevaclyn was initiated in December 2012 after new data from a large, long-term study called HPS2-THRIVE became available. The results of the study, which are still preliminary, indicated that taking nicotinic acid / laropiprant together with a statin has no significant additional benefit in reducing the risk of major vascular events such as heart attack and stroke, compared with statin therapy alone. In addition, a higher frequency of non-fatal but serious side effects was seen in patients taking these medicines.Having reviewed the results of the study, the CHMP concluded that the benefits of Tredaptive, Pelzont and Trevaclyn no longer outweigh the risks and that their marketing authorisations should be suspended.More information on the HPS2-THRIVE study is available below.The CHMP opinion will now be sent to the European Commission for the adoption of a legally binding decision throughout the EU.Information to patientsTredaptive, Pelzont and Trevaclyn are identical medicines used to treat adults with dyslipidaemia (abnormally high blood levels of fats such as triglycerides and cholesterol). Such treatment is ultimately aimed to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels.The Agency has recommended the suspension of Tredaptive, Pelzont or Trevaclyn following the review of new evidence which indicated that the benefits of these medicines no longer outweigh their risks for patients.If you are taking Tredaptive, Pelzont or Trevaclyn you will have to discontinue treatment, as these medicines will no longer be available from the week starting on 21 January 2013.You should make a non-urgent appointment with your doctor to review your treatment.If you have any questions, you should contact your doctor or pharmacist.Information to healthcare professionalsHealthcare professionals should follow these recommendations:In light of the unfavourable benefit-risk balance of Tredaptive, Pelzont and Trevaclyn, doctors should no longer prescribe these medicines to their patients.Doctors should review their patients' treatment in order to discontinue treatment with these medicines, which will no longer be available from the week starting on 21 January 2013.Pharmacists should refer patients on new or repeated prescriptions for Tredaptive, Pelzont and Trevaclyn to the treating doctor.The Agency's recommendations are based on the new data from the HPS2-THRIVE study:The HPS2-THRIVE study was a large, long-term study involving 25,673 patients considered to be at high risk for cardiovascular events due to a history of occlusive vascular disease. Of those enrolled, 14,741 were from Europe and 10,932 were from China. Patients were followed for a median of 3.9 years.The study was designed to assess the effect of adding nicotinic acid / laropiprant to statins on a composite endpoint of major vascular events, which included the combination of coronary death, non-fatal heart attack, stroke and revascularisation. Patients were treated with simvastatin 40 mg or simvastatin 40 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg to achieve a total cholesterol level of less than 3.5 mmol/l, and were then randomised to nicotinic acid / laropiprant or placebo. Treatment with nicotinic acid / laropiprant together with a statin did not result in a statistically significant reduction in major vascular events such as heart attack and stroke compared with statin therapy alone.An increase in the incidence of non-fatal but serious adverse events was seen. These included bleeding (intracranial and gastro-intestinal), myopathy, infections and new-onset diabetes.As taking Tredaptive, Pelzont and Trevaclyn together with a statin has no additional benefit in reducing the risk of major vascular events compared with statin therapy alone and taking into account the increased risk of serious side effects, the CHMP recommended the suspension of these medicines.More about the medicineTredaptive, Pelzont and Trevaclyn contain two active substances: nicotinic acid (1,000 mg) and laropiprant (20 mg). They are available as modified release tablets (meaning that the two active substances are released at different rates over a few hours).Tredaptive, Pelzont and Trevaclyn are identical medicines authorised throughout the EU on 3 July 2008 for the treatment of dyslipidaemia in combination with a statin when statin treatment alone is not sufficient, or alone in patients unable to take statins. The medicine has been marketed under one of these trade names by Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd in all EU Member States, except Bulgaria, France and Romania.The two active substances, nicotinic acid and laropiprant, have different functions. Nicotinic acid is a naturally occurring substance used in low doses as a vitamin (known as niacin or vitamin B3). In higher doses, it reduces the levels of fat in the blood via a mechanism that is not fully understood. It was first used as a medicine to modify blood fat levels in the mid-1950s, but its use has been limited because of its side effects, particularly flushing (reddening of the skin). Laropiprant has no effect on cholesterol but it reduces flushing, by blocking the receptors for a substance called 'prostaglandin D2' which is released when nicotinic acid is taken and which dilates (widens) the blood vessels in the skin.More about the procedureThe review of Tredaptive, Pelzont and Trevaclyn was initiated at the request of the European Commission on 19 December 2012, under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 following the procedural steps laid out in Article 107j and 107k of Directive 2001/83/EC. The European Commission asked the Agency to assess the impact of the new data from the HPS2-THRIVE study, and to issue an opinion on whether the marketing authorisation for these medicines should be maintained, varied, suspended or withdrawn across the EU.A review of these data was first conducted by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC). The PRAC recommendations were sent to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), responsible for all questions concerning medicines for human use, which adopted the Agency's final opinion. Further information on the PRAC recommendation and the background to this review can be found on Agency's website.The CHMP opinion will now be forwarded to the European Commission, which will issue a final decision in due course.NoteThis document now includes information that the European Commission has taken temporary measures to suspend the marketing authorisation and supply of the medicines across the European Union.

18279,EMA_NEWS_2394,2017-04-21,Meeting highlights from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 18-21 April 2017,"Eleven medicines recommended for approval, including four orphansThe European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended eleven medicines for approval at its April meeting.The CHMP recommended granting marketing authorisations for two orphan medicines to treat rare neurodegenerative conditions in children: Spinraza (nusinersen) to treat patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Brineura (cerliponase alfa) to treat neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease. Both medicines were reviewed under EMA's accelerated assessment programme. For more information on these medicines, please see the press releases in the grid below.Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin) received a positive opinion from the Committee for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Besponsa has an orphan designation.The CHMP granted a positive opinion for Kevzara (sarilumab) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.Skilarence (dimethyl fumarate) received a positive opinion from the Committee for the treatment of psoriasis.One hybrid application, Cuprior (trientine tetrahydrochloride), received a positive opinion for the treatment of Wilson's disease, a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder. Hybrid applications rely in part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials for a reference product and in part on new data. Cuprior has an orphan designation.Three biosimilar medicines were recommended for approval by the Committee: Erelzi (etanercept) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis and paediatric plaque psoriasis; and Rixathon and Riximyo, both containing rituximab, for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis. Rixathon is also intended for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. A biosimilar medicine is a biological medicine that is highly similar to another biological medicine that is already authorised for use.Two generic medicines received a positive opinion from the CHMP: Febuxostat Mylan (febuxostat) for the prevention and treatment of hyperuricaemia and Ucedane (carglumic acid) for the treatment of hyperammonaemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase primary deficiency.Three recommendations on extensions of therapeutic indicationsThe Committee recommended extensions of indications for Avastin, Celsentri and Opdivo.Withdrawal of applicationAn application for an initial marketing authorisation for Solithromycin Triskel EU Services (solithromycin) has been withdrawn. This medicine was intended for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, inhaled anthrax and inhaled tularaemia.

17115,EMA_PR_1230,2012-03-05,European Medicines Agency publishes updated set of mandatory Article 57(2) requirements for marketing authorisation holders,"Mandatory data set to be submitted by 2 July 2012The European Medicines Agency has published an updated set of mandatory requirements for marketing authorisation holders to comply with Article 57(2), one of the key measures of the new pharmacovigilance legislation. The Agency has considerably reduced the number of data fields initially required in the format published on 2 July 2011, thus significantly reducing the administrative burden and helping marketing authorisation holders to meet their legal deadline of 2 July 2012.The Agency will continue to support marketing authorisation holders on the data submission process through online and face-to-face training and a dedicated helpdesk. An online data entry tool (EVWEB) hosted by the Agency to facilitate data submission by small and medium-sized enterprises was also released into production today.Article 57(2) of the new pharmacovigilance legislation requires the Agency to establish lists of all human medicines authorised in the European Union (EU), based on structured data submitted by the marketing authorisation holders of these medicines. These lists will assist the Agency in the coordination of pharmacovigilance activities and the protection of public health by facilitating clear identification of medicines in reports on adverse reactions and of medicines affected by a safety review.Since the initial publication of the requirements in July 2011, the Agency has listened carefully to all stakeholders and looked at how the mandatory data set could be reduced while ensuring that the public-health goals of the legislation and patient safety are not compromised. These goals have been successfully achieved and have resulted in a reduction in the number of data fields which are mandatory.In January 2012, the Agency held a workshop with EU pharmaceutical industry associations for human medicines. During this workshop, stakeholders were supportive of the Agency's proposal for an updated set of mandatory data for submission by 2 July 2012. A summary of the workshop is available on the Agency's website.The Agency will work with stakeholders throughout 2012 on further defining requirements for data maintenance, submission of structured substance information and the implementation of ISO IDMP standards, a set of internationally harmonised specifications for the unique identification of medicines.NotesMore information on the revised Article 57 requirements is available in the summary note: Article 57(2) requirements: information to marketing authorisation holders on the revised format for electronic submission of information on medicines .The revised legal notice on the implementation of Article 57(2), second subparagraph of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, together with the format (detailed guidance and XEVMPD messaging schemas) of the electronic submission of information on medicinal products for human use by marketing authorisation holders to the European Medicines Agency and a frequently asked questions document are available: Documents for electronic submission of information on medicines. Working examples are included in the detailed guidance.For any questions on the implementation of Article 57(2), marketing authorisation holders are advised to use the Agency's dedicated mail box: art57@ema.europa.eu and dedicated helpline +44 (0)20 7523 7010.Information on training and how to register to submit data to the Agency are available: Registration and training.The summary of the workshop held on 30 January 2012 is available: European Medicines Agency workshop with European Union pharmaceutical industry associations on the implementation of Article 57(2), second subparagraph of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004.

17956,EMA_NEWS_2071,2015-07-28,EMA to encourage use of scientific advice for post-authorisation safety studies,"12-month pilot will support design of high-quality safety studiesThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) is launching a 12-month pilot to encourage companies to seek scientific advice for post-authorisation safety studies (PASS) for medicines. This voluntary, optional procedure will help to improve the design of studies meant to collect further information on a medicine's safety once it is on the market. This pilot will build on the expertise of the Agency's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC).The main focus of the pilot will be non-imposed PASS, i.e. studies which are not a condition to the marketing authorisation.EMA, through its Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP), provides scientific advice to companies during the development of their medicines to help them design trials that are scientifically sound and generate robust data for the benefit-risk assessment of medicines. This new scientific advice procedure will systematically involve PRAC. The membership of the SAWP will be extended to include at least two PRAC delegates plus alternates, adding specific expertise in pharmacoepidemiology to the competences of the SAWP. The scientific advice for the PASS protocols will be agreed by the PRAC.The PRAC currently endorses the protocols of imposed PASS studies and can review protocols of non-imposed PASS. With this pilot, EMA is offering an additional option for companies to ask specific questions on the design of their studies through scientific advice earlier on, or at any other stage of the development of the protocol of these studies. This should result in efficiency gains throughout the process, allow a more intensive interaction with companies and help shorten protocol review times.In this pilot, requesting scientific advice should assist the developers in putting together safety studies which are of high quality and can provide useful information on a medicine in a real-life setting, in the interest of patients. Overall, the pilot will foster a more integrated approach to the planning of safety, efficacy and quality studies during the lifecycle of a medicine.EMA is publishing updated questions and answers to give more details on this procedure, as well as the companies should send to the Agency to submit a request for scientific advice."
16726,EMA_PR_0841,2009-12-04,European Medicines Agency advises of risk of fever in young children following vaccination with Pandemrix,"The European Medicines Agency is warning that young children may experience fever after their second dose of the pandemic influenza vaccine Pandemrix. Prescribers and parents should monitor the temperature of the vaccinated child and, if necessary, take measures to lower the fever (e.g. giving an antipyretic such as paracetamol). However, the Agency noted that the second dose increases the immune response against pandemic influenza.The Agency has recommended that this information be included in the prescribing information, and be taken into consideration when deciding whether to give a second dose to children.This follows the review of new data submitted by the manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline from an ongoing clinical trial in children aged from 6 months to three years. These data showed a higher proportion of children developing fever (temperature above 38°C, when measured under the armpit) after the second dose of Pandemrix, compared with after the first. The data also showed that there was more soreness at the site of injection and more general symptoms such as drowsiness, irritability and loss of appetite after the second dose.The study also showed that a single dose of vaccine triggered a good immune response in young children, but that the second dose further increased the immune response.The Agency will continue to evaluate all information that becomes available and make further recommendations as necessary.

17527,EMA_NEWS_1642,2013-10-15,European Medicines Agency publishes report on sales of veterinary antimicrobials in 25 countries in 2011,"The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has published a report on sales of veterinary antimicrobial agents in Europe in 2011 . The report, which is one of the main deliverables of the European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption (ESVAC) project based at the EMA, presents standardised, aggregated sales data on veterinary antimicrobial agents.A total of 25 European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries have submitted data to the EMA, marking a further improvement to the 2010 report, as these countries account for approximately 95% of the food-producing animal population in the EU and EEA.The report highlights that 19 of the 20 countries that provided data to the ESVAC project in both 2010 and 2011 reported a decrease in sales in 2011, ranging from 0.4% to 28%. While it is premature to consider this as representing a definitive trend, it is a positive sign at this early stage of reporting. If it continues in future years, it could suggest that initiatives such as responsible-use campaigns, restrictions of use, increased awareness of the threat of antimicrobial resistance and the setting of targets for use reduction in EU Member States are starting to have an impact in terms of reducing the overall sale of antimicrobials in the veterinary sector. Additional information on national programmes and campaigns on the responsible use of antimicrobial agents, and more years of experience collecting data from all EU/EEA countries, are required before firm conclusions can be drawn.As recognised by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) in the CVMP strategy on antimicrobials 2011-2015 , the responsible use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine is a key factor in minimising the risk of the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Collecting accurate data on the sales of antimicrobial agents in food-producing animals is an essential first step to support the development and monitoring of policies to minimise the risk of antibiotic resistance in the food chain.The report will be used by risk assessors and risk managers in Member States to inform antimicrobial policy and the responsible use of antimicrobials.It is published today alongside a revised ESVAC reflection paper on collecting data on consumption of antimicrobial agents per animal species, on technical units of measurement and indicators for reporting consumption of antimicrobial agents in animals.The ESVAC project was launched by the EMA following a request from the European Commission to develop a harmonised approach to the collection and reporting of data on the use of antimicrobial agents in animals from EU Member states."
18202,EMA_NEWS_2317,2016-11-11,Meeting highlights from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 7-10 November 2016,"Nine medicines recommended for approval, including three biosimilarsThe European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended nine medicines for approval at its November meeting.The CHMP recommended granting a marketing authorisation for Afstyla (lonoctocog alfa) for the prevention and treatment of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A.Vemlidy (tenofovir alafenamide) received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.Fiasp (insulin aspart) was recommended for approval by the CHMP for the treatment of diabetes.Suliqua (insulin glargine / lixisenatide) was recommended for approval for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.Three biosimilar medicines were recommended for approval by the Committee: Lusduna (insulin glargine) for the treatment of diabetes, and Movymia and Terrosa (both containing teriparatide) for the treatment of osteoporosis. A biosimilar medicine is a biological medicine that is similar to another biological medicine that is already authorised for use.Two generic medicines were recommended for approval: Darunavir Mylan (darunavir) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection and Tadalafil Generics (tadalafil) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.Five recommendations on extensions of therapeutic indicationsThe Committee recommended extensions of indications for Arzerra, Caprelsa, Humira, Nimenrix and Vimpat.Translarna: renewal of conditional marketing authorisationThe CHMP completed its scientific assessment of the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation for Translarna (ataluren) and recommended that the conditional marketing authorisation be renewed.As part of the CHMP assessment, the Committee reviewed all available data, including the results of a study performed by the marketing authorisation holder as a requirement of the conditional marketing authorisation after initial approval. Although the data available to date continue to indicate that Translarna slows the progression of the disease and there are no major safety concerns, the Committee considered that further comprehensive data are still needed to fully confirm that the benefit-risk balance of the medicine is positive.The CHMP has therefore requested that the marketing authorisation holder for Translarna conducts a new 18-month randomised, placebo-controlled study in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, followed by an 18-month period where all patients will be switched to Translarna. The study results are expected to be available in the first quarter of 2021.Translarna is used to treat patients aged five years and older with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a serious and rare condition for which no authorised treatments are currently available. The medicine is intended for use in patients who are able to walk and whose disease is caused by a specific genetic defect (called a 'nonsense mutation') in the gene for the muscle protein dystrophin.Conditional approval allows EMA to recommend a medicine for marketing authorisation where the benefit to public health of its immediate availability on the market outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. These medicines are subject to specific post-authorisation obligations that aim to generate comprehensive data on the medicine. Conditional marketing authorisations are valid for one year and can be renewed or converted to a standard five-year marketing authorisation when the additional data generated confirm that the benefit-risk balance of the medicine is positive.The assessment report on the renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation for Translarna will be published after the European Commission issues its decision on the renewal.Agenda and minutesThe agenda of the November 2016 CHMP meeting is published on EMA's website.

18377,EMA_PR_2492,2017-11-13,EMA and EUnetHTA finalise joint work plan for 2017-2020,"Medicines regulator and network of health technology assessment (HTA) bodies continue to strengthen their collaborationThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA) have published a joint work plan outlining key areas of collaboration for the next three years.The EMA-EUnetHTA collaboration, which began in 2010, aims to harness synergies between regulatory evaluation and health technology assessment (HTA) along the lifecycle of a medicine whilst respecting their different remits. The overall goal is to improve the efficiency and quality of processes and ensure mutual understanding and dialogue on evidence needs. This facilitates improved access to medicines for patients in the European Union (EU).“Regulators and HTA bodies have different responsibilities with regards to medicines. What unites us is a common goal of getting to the market more high-quality medicines that address unmet needs of millions of patients in the EU,” said EMA's Executive Director, Professor Guido Rasi. “By working together, EMA and EUnetHTA help medicine developers to improve clinical research and become more efficient in generating the evidence each of us needs for good decision-making.”“This work plan shows a broad commitment from the regulatory as well the HTA side to find clear synergy in our activities,” said EUnetHTA's Director Wim Goettsch. “I believe that there is a common sentiment that these activities are essential to make our processes more transparent, efficient and timely for patients, producers and other key stakeholders.”Some objectives of the new work plan include areas in which major progress has already been made, most notably:early dialogue / scientific advice: a new joint platform for parallel consultation was created in July 2017 to provide developers of medicines with simultaneous, coordinated regulatory and HTA advice on their development plans and facilitate alignment of data requirements;information exchange at market entry: the exchange of information on the outcome of the regulatory assessment at the time of marketing authorisation as part of EUnetHTA's new framework for production of relative effectiveness assessments (REAs);post-authorisation data generation: post-licensing evidence generation tools, such as patient registries, are being optimised to serve data needs for various decision-makers.In addition, EMA and EUnetHTA will further collaborate in a number of areas including:exploring how HTA bodies and regulators apply the concepts of unmet medical need and therapeutic innovation in view of possible synergies;understanding the conceptual similarities and differences between the significant benefit of orphan medicines versus their added therapeutic value.These activities are directly related to the core activities of both organisations.The three-year work plan is complementary to actions foreseen in EUnetHTA Joint Action 3, which runs until 2020.Furthermore, the activities in this work plan will feed into the implementation of the areas for collaboration identified in the reflection paper from the HTA network on Synergies between regulatory and HTA issues on pharmaceuticals and will be developed in close cooperation with the European Commission.More on EMA-EUnetHTA collaborationThe collaboration between EMA and EUnetHTA started in 2010. This collaboration began initially to address recommendations by the Pharmaceutical Forum, a high-level group of European policy makers, to improve the way data published by EU regulators as part of their benefit-risk assessment contribute to relative effectiveness assessments by HTA organisations. Furthermore, topics of mutual interest were identified and included in the work plan for 2012-2015, for which a report is available.EMA and EUnetHTA hold regular bilateral meetings to progress the various actions. Their meeting reports are published on their respective websites.NotesEUnetHTA is a network of organisations (from EU Member States, EEA and accession countries) and a large number of relevant regional agencies and not-for-profit organisations that produce or contribute to health technology assessment in Europe. EUnetHTA enables scientific cooperation between HTA bodies in Europe. It is co-funded by the Public Health Programme of the European Commission, DG Health and Consumers and performs the function of the scientific and technical cooperation of the HTA network established as per the Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare.HTA bodies provide recommendations on the medicines that can be paid for or reimbursed by the healthcare system in a particular Member State.

17542,EMA_NEWS_1657,2013-10-29,European Medicines Agency explores ways to further involve patients in the benefit-risk assessment of medicines,"The European Medicines Agency has published a report of the workshop held on 26 September 2013 to discuss further development of patient involvement in the evaluation of medicines, in particular in the assessment of benefit and risk that lies at the heart of the regulatory process. The Agency believes that incorporating the knowledge, views and preferences of patients throughout the lifecycle of medicines, from early stages of development through to authorisation and monitoring of safety and efficacy, adds value to the scientific assessment.Because the views of patients on the benefit and risk of a medicine can differ from those of other stakeholders, and may also vary among patients and at different disease stages, this process often requires innovative approaches and methodologies.The Workshop on the patient's voice in the evaluation of medicines brought together representatives of patients, consumers and healthcare professionals as well as the pharmaceutical industry and members of the Agency's scientific committees and staff.Action points identified included the need to:identify where quantitative versus qualitative input is needed, and develop and validate new tools for eliciting values and preferences and representing benefit and risk; these tools need to take account of the way values vary between patients and can change during the patient journey;develop means for identifying and managing differences of view among patients, and between patients and other stakeholders;consider what training and support is needed to maximise patient involvement at all stages of the process for the full range of disease states, and who should be supplying these;further develop the role and timing of patient involvement in later, post-marketing stages of the product lifecycle (e.g. in signal assessment);identify and try to minimise legal, regulatory, financial and procedural barriers to patient involvement.These action points will be considered as part of the on-going review of the existing formal framework of interaction between the Agency and patient and consumer organisations. This framework has been in place since 2005 and defines how the Agency interacts with patients and consumers.Currently, patient representatives are involved in a number of Agency activities in the capacity of:full members of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), Paediatric Committee (PDCO), Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) and Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP): representatives of patient organisations participate in the same way as other committee members;experts in the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP): companies can request scientific advice on the appropriate tests and studies to be carried out at any stage in the development of a medicine. The EMA has been increasingly involving patient representatives in SAWP meetings as they can bring a unique perspective on areas such as the feasibility of study proposals, patient population, duration and design of studies and relevant outcomes and safety concerns from a patient point of view;experts in the various scientific advisory groups (SAGs), which provide specialised advice to the Agency's scientific committees on the benefit-risk evaluation of specific types of medicines or treatments. Patient representatives are commonly involved as SAG members (in over 80% of cases in 2013).In addition, a permanent forum for dialogue between the Agency and patient representatives, the Patients' and Consumers' Working Party (PCWP), provides recommendations to the Agency and its human scientific committees on all matters of interest to patients in relation to medicines."

The report shows good performance by the Agency in the first six months of the year, with the provision of scientific advice and protocol assistance being one area where activity was particularly high.One hundred and seventy-nine requests for scientific advice and protocol assistance were received in the first half of 2008 – a 28% increase on the number received during the same period in 2007 – with a further 186 applications expected to be received by the end of the year. The provision of this advice in support of pharmaceutical companies' research and development of medicines is a key activity area for the EMEA – one which fosters research and innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector and therefore promotes the earlier availability of medicines for the treatment of patients.Numbers of applications for the initial evaluation of medicinal products remained at a similar level to what was recorded during the first half of 2007, with six being received for orphan medicines (medicines for rare diseases) and 26 for non-orphan medicines.The report to the Management Board indicated that the performance of the Agency in other areas of activity, relating to both human and veterinary medicines, was, on the whole, on target. The Board noted the important contribution made by the Agency – working closely with the European Commission, the Member States of the European Union (EU) and other EU bodies – to the successful operation of regulatory procedures for paediatric medicines and the implementation of the new legislation on advanced-therapy medicines. In the paediatrics area, the Agency's workload continued to be high, following the first year of activity of its Paediatric Committee, with a total of 227 applications for review of paediatric investigation plans (PIPs) and waiver requests being received in the first half of 2008.The EMEA's role in protecting and promoting animal health was also reflected in the half-year report. Notably, the Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) received five applications for 'authorisation under exceptional circumstances'. These applications concerned inactivated vaccines against Bluetongue – a midge-borne viral disease that affects ruminant animals such as sheep and cattle –, and were processed in accordance with the EMEA's accelerated procedure in order to help combat the dramatic increase in new cases of the disease seen in farms across the EU since summer/autumn 2006.EU telematics master planThe Management Board also endorsed an updated EU telematics master plan, covering the period 2008-2013. The plan sets the vision and schedule for implementation of a set of pan-European IT systems and databases used to support the post-authorisation monitoring of the risk-benefit balance of medicines in the EU, increased efficiency across the European medicines regulatory network, and increased transparency and availability of high-quality information on medicines for the public.-- ENDS --Notes:1. EMEA half-year reports are internal documents presented by the Executive Director to the Management Board. A public report on EMEA activities for the whole year is published each year in spring.2. The EU telematics master plan was adopted by the Management Board in October 2007.3.

17809,EMA_NEWS_1924,2014-11-21,Regulatory update - EMA encourages companies to submit type-I variations for 2014 by end of November,"EMA to check validity of submissions by end 2014The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is advising marketing-authorisation holders to submit any type-IAIN and type-IA variations for 2014 by Friday 28 November wherever possible.This will enable the Agency to acknowledge the validity of the submissions before the Agency's closure between 24 December 2014 and 2 January 2015 within the 30-day timeframe set out in Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.Marketing-authorisation holders intending to submit type-IB variations or groupings of type-IB and type-IA variations for human medicines in December 2014 should liaise with EMA prior to submission. They should send an e-mail to ibquery@ema.europa.eu indicating 'Type IB December submission' in the subject line and mentioning the name of the product, the intended submission date and the scopes to be applied according to the Classification guideline in the body of the e-mail.Similarly, marketing-authorisation holders for veterinary medicines should send an e-mail to vet.applications@ema.europa.eu.Type-I variations are minor changes to the marketing authorisation of a medicine.Type-IAIN and -IA variations have no impact on the quality, safety or efficacy of the medicine. Type-IAIN variations must be notified to the national competent authority or EMA immediately following implementation, in order to ensure the continuous supervision of the medicine. Type-IA variations do not require immediate notification and should be notified to the national competent authority or EMA within 12 months of implementation, or earlier in certain cases.Type-IB variations must be notified to the national competent authority or EMA before implementation, but do not require a formal approval. Upon acknowledgement of receipt of a valid notification, the marketing-authorisation holder must wait for a period of 30 days to ensure that the notification is deemed acceptable by the national competent authority or EMA before implementing the change."
17824,EMA_NEWS_1939,2014-12-16,Focus on innovative medicines for animals,"New EMA expert group to support veterinary novel therapiesThe European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) has established a new Ad Hoc Expert Group on Veterinary Novel Therapies (ADVENT) aimed at providing more guidance on new classes of veterinary medicines, such as stem cell-based therapies or monoclonal antibodies.This initiative is responding to a need expressed by industry and the regulatory network and is part of the Agency's efforts to support development of innovative medicines to further improve the health and wellbeing of animals. It follows the reinforcement in November 2013 of the Agency's Innovation Task Force to also provide support to novel veterinary medicines during the early stages of their development.The expert group will provide guidance on the requirements for authorisation of veterinary novel medicines. These include therapies representing a novel concept or for which there is no experience in the veterinary area yet. The advice will be general in nature and will not be related to a particular application or product.The CVMP will determine a list of priority topics for ADVENT. To draw up the list, the Committee will take into account recent feedback from stakeholders. These priority topics will be published on the EMA website within the work plan for ADVENT, to be agreed and published in early 2015.ADVENT is composed of a small core group of six experienced regulators with broad knowledge on the regulation of veterinary medicines and additional specific knowledge relevant to quality, safety or efficacy of veterinary medicinal products. The group will be supported by additional groups of experts in a specific scientific area as required.Members of the ADVENT core group were elected at the CVMP meeting in December 2014 and a chair will be elected at the CVMP meeting in January 2015."

The Committee, having re-assessed the benefit-risk balance of these products, concluded that their quality, safety and efficacy continue to be appropriately demonstrated and, therefore, recommended the renewals of the marketing authorisations.Community referrals and related proceduresThe Committee started a procedure to prepare a scientific opinion, under Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, regarding the substance lidocaine. The matter was submitted to the European Medicines Agency by the Netherlands, on the basis of new scientific data on metabolism, in order to address potential risks to the consumer resulting from the use of lidocaine in food-producing species.Maximum residue limitsFurther to requests and in accordance with CVMP guidance to include a substance in the list of substances considered as not falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009, the Committee concluded that the excipients PPG-2 myristyl ether propionate and polybutene do not fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) 470/2009.Minor use minor species (MUMS) / limited marketsFollowing the Committee's review of one request for classification under the MUMS / limited-markets policy, which concerned a product with musculoskeletal indication for horses, the CVMP considered that the product was indicated for MUMS / limited market and was eligible for financial incentives.PharmacovigilanceThe Committee reviewed the periodic safety update reports (PSURs) for Cimalgex, Emdocam, Gripovac 3, Ingelvac CircoFLEX, Loxicom, Proteq West Nile, Reconcile, RevitaCAM, Startvac, Zulvac 1 Bovis and Zuprevo and concluded that no further action or changes to their product literature were required.Concept papers, guidelines and standard operating proceduresSafetyThe Committee adopted a concept paper on genotoxic impurities (EMA/CVMP/SWP/398880/2012) for a three-month period of public consultation. The concept paper proposes the development of guidance outlining the data requirements and assessment approach needed for the determination of acceptable levels for impurities with genotoxic potential in veterinary medicinal products, taking account of both target animal safety and consumer safety.AntimicrobialsThe Committee adopted a concept paper on the development of a guideline on antimicrobial risk assessment (EMA/CVMP/680258/2012) for a three-month period of public consultation. The concept paper proposes the development of a guideline on antimicrobial-resistance risk assessment to be applied for all classes of antimicrobial agents. The guideline will provide a basis for transparent and consistent assessment of public-health risk related to antimicrobial resistance to be applied both by companies and regulatory bodies.The documents above will be available on the Agency's website.Working partiesThe Committee elected Helen Jukes as chair of the newly established Antimicrobials Working Party for a three-year mandate.International harmonisationThe Committee adopted a draft revised International Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH) safety guideline for release in the European Union following sign-off by the VICH Steering Committee:GL 23(R) on safety: Studies to evaluate the safety of residues of veterinary drugs in human food: Genotoxicity testing – three-month public consultation.The guideline will be published on the Agency's website.

17168,EMA_NEWS_1283,2012-05-16,International Clinical Trials Day : 20 May 2012,"The European Medicines Agency supports International Clinical Trials Day, which is taking place on Sunday 20 May 2012.International Clinical Trials Day aims to enhance communication and coordination of clinical trials between countries, resulting in better clinical research that is relevant to the needs of patients everywhere. It is celebrated every year on or around 20 May, commemorating the day that James Lind started his famous trial comparing treatments for scurvy on 20 May 1747.The majority of the Agency's scientific work is centred on the review, coordination and supervision of clinical trials:its scientific evaluation work involves the review of clinical-trial data that are included in the application information from a pharmaceutical company when seeking marketing authorisation;it provides scientific advice on the design of clinical trials conducted as part of medicine development and decisions on clinical-trial design as part of paediatric investigation plans (PIPs);it provides scientific guidance on the design and conduct of clinical trials in specific therapeutic areas;it has a central role in ensuring application of good clinical practice (GCP) at a European Union (EU) level. GCP is the international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, recording and reporting clinical trials that involve the participation of human subjects.The Agency hosts the EU clinical trials register on behalf of EU Member States. This website contains information on interventional clinical trials of medicines, allowing users to view descriptions of clinical trials being conducted in the EU, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway, and descriptions of trials forming part of a PIP including those where the investigator sites are outside the EU.The Agency is also responsible for the development, maintenance and coordination of the EudraCT database, an application used by national medicine regulatory authorities to enter clinical trial data from clinical trial sponsors.The Agency expects clinical trials carried out in countries outside the EU submitted in marketing-authorisation applications to EU regulatory authorities to meet the same ethical principles and standards as those performed within the EU. In response to this challenge, the Agency recently published a reflection paper offering practical guidance on how clinical trials outside the EU should be conducted, when data from these trials is included in marketing-authorisation applications submitted in the EU.The paper puts forward concrete steps for international cooperation in the regulation of clinical trials, with a specific emphasis on capacity-building initiatives for a common approach to oversight of trials.It also clarifies and determines the practical steps by which EU regulators will gain assurance that ethical and GCP standards are applied to clinical trials for human medicines, both during the development and during the marketing-authorisation-application phase. It also promotes greater transparency regarding the evaluation of these matters during the marketing-authorisation phase."

The purpose of the guideline is to provide guidance on all stages of clinical drug development for the treatment of malignancies, including drug resistance modifiers or normal tissue protective compounds. The revised guideline underlines the importance of exploratory studies in order to properly define the most appropriate target population and puts further emphasis on the role of biomarkers. The guideline now incorporates disease-specific guidance, including new guidance for lung cancer, prostate cancer and revised guidance for haematological malignancies. The appendix on methodological considerations for using progression-free survival (PFS) or disease-free survival (DFS) in confirmatory trials has also been revised and expanded, in particular aspects related to censoring, radiological review, interim analyses and cross-over.Comments on the reflection paper should be submitted by 31 May 2012 using the Agency's comments template"

17626,EMA_NEWS_1741,2014-02-10,Regulatory information - EMA clarifies interpretation of new variation classification categories,"The European Medicines Agency has clarified, in agreement with the European Commission, a number of points related to the new categories of variations to the terms of marketing authorisations that were introduced in August 2013. The related question and answer document has been updated to reflect these adjustments.The Commission guidelines on variations to marketing authorisations of medicinal products were amended in 2013. The revision of the variations guidelines was principally triggered by the implementation of the pharmacovigilance legislation.In the light of experience accumulated with the application of the new guidelines, it is appropriate to make the following clarifications:the submission of paediatric studies under article 46 of the European paediatric regulation is to be handled as a post-authorisation measure if the marketing-auhtorisation holder confirms that they deem no changes to the product information necessary; an implementing variation category C.1.3 is triggered only when amendments to the product information are identified following assessment by the Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). In cases where the marketing-auhtorisation holder identifies the need to update the product information based on the data of the P46 study at the time of submission, a variation category C.1.4 needs to be applied for;the submission of environmental risk assessment (ERA) for medicines for human use will be handled as type IB variations and not as type II variations since these reports do not contain information affecting the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicines;the request by a marketing authorisation holder to amend the due dates of the conditions of a marketing authorisation or of measures in a risk management plan is to be handled as a type IB variation.These adjustments will be applied retrospectively by the Agency from 1 January 2014. They concern centrally authorised products only."

The changes will reduce the administrative burden for companies that are already registered as SMEs with the Agency and wish to maintain their SME status.A revised SME declaration form has been made available for the submission of data as part of the SME registration process as well as information on enterprises for the SME public register.Companies registered as SMEs with the Agency have access to a number of incentives, including regulatory assistance from the SME office, reduced fees for certain Agency procedures such as scientific advice and inspections, and fee incentives for pharmacovigilance activities."
17815,EMA_PR_1930,2014-11-21,CMDh agrees to strengthen warnings on the use of valproate medicines in women and girls,"Women to be better informed of risks of valproate use in pregnancy and need for contraceptionThe Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures – Human (CMDh) a regulatory body representing EU Member States, has agreed to strengthen warnings on the use of valproate medicines in women and girls due to the risk of malformations and developmental problems in babies who are exposed to valproate in the womb. The warnings aim to ensure that patients are aware of the risks and that they take valproate only when clearly necessary.Doctors in the EU are now advised not to prescribe valproate for epilepsy or bipolar disorder in pregnant women, in women who can become pregnant or in girls unless other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated. Those for whom valproate is the only option for epilepsy or bipolar disorder should be advised on the use of effective contraception and treatment should be started and supervised by a doctor experienced in treating these conditions.Women and girls who have been prescribed valproate should not stop taking their medicines without consulting their doctor as doing so could result in harm to themselves or to an unborn child.In countries where valproate medicines are also authorised for the prevention of migraine, valproate must not be used for this purpose in pregnant women, and doctors should exclude pregnancy before starting preventive treatment for migraine. Doctors must not prescribe valproate for migraine prevention for women who are not on effective contraception.These recommendations follow a review of recent studies showing developmental problems in up to 30 to 40% of pre-school children exposed to valproate in the womb, including delayed walking and talking, memory problems, difficulty with speech and language and lower intellectual ability.1,2,3,4,5Previous data have shown that children exposed to valproate in the womb are also at increased risk of autistic spectrum disorder (around 3 times higher than in the general population) and childhood autism (5 times higher than in the general population). There are also limited data suggesting that children exposed to valproate in the womb may be more likely to develop symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).6,7,8In addition, children exposed to valproate in the womb are at an approximately 11% risk of malformations at birth (such as neural tube defects and cleft palate)9 compared with a 2 to 3% risk for children in the general population.Doctors should ensure that their patients are adequately informed of the risks of taking valproate during pregnancy, and should regularly review the need for treatment in female patients who can have children. Doctors should also re-assess the balance of the benefits and risks of valproate medicines for any female patient who becomes or plans to become pregnant and for girls reaching puberty.The review of valproate was conducted by the EMA's Pharmacovigilance and Risks Assessment Committee (PRAC), following which the CMDh endorsed the PRAC's recommendations.The recommendations on the use of valproate in women and girls will be implemented by EU Member States according to an agreed timetable.Information to patientsDo not stop taking your valproate medicine without consulting your doctor as doing so could cause harm to you or an unborn child.Valproate medicines can cause malformations and problems with early development of children if they are exposed to these medicines in the womb.If you can become pregnant, you should use an effective method of contraception. Speak to your doctor if you have any questions about which contraceptive method is appropriate for you.Tell your doctor at once if you become pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor will urgently review your treatment.If you have any questions about your treatment or contraception, speak to your doctor or pharmacist.Information to healthcare professionalsFollowing an evaluation of the data on the risks of valproate use during pregnancy, the recommendations for the use of valproate in women and girls have been updated:For treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder in female patients who can have childrenOnly prescribe valproate medicines for epilepsy and bipolar disorder if other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated.Advise patients taking valproate medicines about effective contraception during their treatment.Ensure that the treatment of epilepsy or bipolar disorder is supervised by a doctor experienced in treating these conditions.Consider alternative treatments if a female patient becomes or plans to become pregnant during valproate treatment. Regularly review the need for treatment and re-assess the balance of the benefits and risks for female patients taking valproate and for girls reaching puberty.Inform patients of the risks of taking valproate during pregnancy.For migraine prevention(in countries where this use is authorised)Do not prescribe valproate for female patients who can have children if they are not using effective methods of contraception or if they are already pregnant – such use is now contraindicated.Exclude pregnancy before starting a female patient on valproate treatment for migraine.Stop valproate treatment in the event of pregnancy or if pregnancy is planned.Ensure that female patients who can become pregnant are aware that they must keep to their contraception throughout treatment.Inform patients of the risks of taking valproate during pregnancy.Healthcare professionals in the EU will be sent a dear healthcare professional letter plus additional educational material concerning these recommendations.More about the medicineValproate medicines are used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder. In some EU Member States they are also authorised to prevent migraine headaches.The active ingredients are listed on the packages as valproic acid, sodium valproate, valproate semisodium or valpromide.Valproate medicines have been authorised via national procedures in all EU Member States and in Norway and Iceland. They are marketed under several brand names including: Absenor, Convival Chrono, Convulex, Convulsofin Tabletten, Delepsine, Depakine, Deprakine, Diplexil, Dipromal, Epilim, Episenta, Epival, Ergenyl, Espa-Valept, Hexaquin, Leptilan, Micropakine L.P., Orfiril, Orlept, Petilin, Valberg, Valepil and Valhel.More about the procedureThe review of valproate medicines started in October 2013 at the request of the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC, following the publication of new data on the risks of malformations and developmental problems in babies exposed to valproate in the womb.The review was first conducted by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), the EMA's Committee responsible for the evaluation of safety issues for human medicines, which made a set of recommendations. As valproate medicines in the EU are all authorised nationally, the PRAC recommendations were forwarded to the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures – Human (CMDh) for a position. The CMDh, a body representing EU Member States, is responsible for ensuring harmonised safety standards across the EU for medicines authorised via national procedures.The CMDh position was agreed by consensus, and the recommendations on the use of valproate in women and girls will be implemented by EU Member States according to an agreed timetable.1Meador K, Reynolds MW, Crean S, et al.

17843,EMA_PR_1958,2015-01-09,Record number of medicines for rare diseases recommended for approval in 2014,"Number of medicines with new active substances continues to increaseIn 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the highest number of orphan designated medicines for marketing authorisation in a year. Out of the 82 medicines for human use recommended in 2014, 17 are intended for the treatment of a rare disease, providing therapies for patients who often have only few or no treatment options.Among them is the first medicine for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Translarna) as well as the first treatment for erythropoietic protoporphyria, a rare genetic disease which causes intolerance to light (Scenesse).The past year also saw the first recommendation worldwide of a therapy based on stem cells. The orphan medicine (Holoclar) is a treatment for limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), a rare eye condition that can result in blindness.Special regulatory pathways were used for these three medicines (conditional marketing authorisation for Translarna and Holoclar, and approval under exceptional circumstances for Scenesse). These mechanisms are in place to potentially speed up market access for medicines that fulfill unmet medical needs but for which comprehensive data cannot be provided at the time of application for a marketing authorisation.Eight new medicines for cancer were recommended for marketing authorisation in 2014, of which Lynparza, Imbruvica, Gazyvaro and Cyramza target rare cancers that are difficult to treat. A targeted treatment for melanoma patients whose cancer has a specific mutation was also recommended for approval in 2014 (Mekinist).Overall, the number of medicines containing new active substances continues to increase. One in two medicines, either orphan or non-orphan, recommended for approval in 2014, contains a substance that has never been used in medicines before. These medicines have the potential to treat diseases for which no treatments were previously available or bring added benefit to patients over existing therapies.During the past year, EMA provided more scientific support in the early stages of medicine development. Almost seven out of ten applicants received scientific advice from EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) during the development phase of their medicine and this figure rises to four out of five when it comes to innovative medicines. This is a significant increase compared with 2013 when only half of applicants who had a positive opinion for their medicine had received scientific advice.Seven positive opinions were granted after an accelerated assessment in 2014 (Daklinza, Harvoni, Exviera, Viekirax, Ofev, Sylvant, Ketoconazole HRA). This mechanism aims to speed up the assessment of medicines that are expected to be of major benefit for public health.Four of these are for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The CHMP used the accelerated assessment tool to make a new generation of medicines available to patients potentially more quickly; these treatments have high cure rates and have recently reshaped the way patients with chronic HCV infection can be treated.In the past year, the CHMP granted a paediatric-use marketing authorisation (PUMA) for Hemangiol for the treatment of proliferating infantile haemangioma, which are benign tumours of blood vessels. PUMAs can be granted for medicines which are already authorised, but no longer under patent or supplementary certificate protection, and that have been developed specifically for children. As an incentive to stimulate the development of existing medicines for the treatment of children, PUMA medicines are granted ten years of market protection.For each of these medicines, EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) and CHMP adopted a risk management plan (RMP) to ensure that safety is monitored throughout the lifecycle of the product allowing appropriate regulatory action to be taken if any new risk arises. Download image in pdf format Notes:These figures include one positive opinion that was adopted following a re-examination procedure (Translarna).These figures include three orphan medicines for which the CHMP recommended conditional approval but whose applications were withdrawn by the sponsor prior to a final decision by the European Commission (Vynfinit and its companion diagnostics Folcepri and Neocepri). After authorisation, the company was to provide confirmatory data from an ongoing study with Vynfinit. However, before the authorisation process could be completed by the European Commission, preliminary data from this study became available which showed that the study could not confirm the benefit of Vynfinit in ovarian cancer patients.

18536,EMA_NEWS_2651,2018-09-18,EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) elects new chair,"At its September 2018 meeting, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) elected Harald Enzmann from Germany as its new chair, for a three-year mandate starting on 21 September 2018. Dr Enzmann will replace Dr Tomas Salmonson, senior scientific advisor at the Swedish Medicinal Products Agency (MPA), who will retire as chair after the September 2018 meeting, having served the maximum of two three-year mandates at the helm of the committee. Dr Enzmann is a medical doctor. He works for the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) in Germany, where he is Head of European and International Affairs. Dr Enzmann has been a member of the CHMP since 2005 and its vice-chair since October 2016. “The CHMP is at the cutting edge of medical progress. With science evolving at such a fast pace, our challenge will be to achieve a balance between being agile to find solutions to emerging scientific or regulatory issues and being consistent with previous decisions,” said Harald Enzmann. “As chair, I will try to elicit in a constructive way the committee members' views, encourage their involvement and structure our scientific discussions to foster consensual decision-making.” The CHMP is the committee at EMA in charge of the scientific evaluation of new medicines. It was set up in 2004 and replaced the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP). The CHMP will elect a new vice-chair at its October 2018 meeting. *Start of mandate updated on 20 September 2018"
16554,EMA_PR_0669,2008-04-24,European Medicines Agency recommendation on use of angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists during pregnancy,"The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has recommended that the product information of all centrally authorised angiotensin II receptor antagonists be harmonised, regarding their use during pregnancy.Following a review of the safety of these medicines during pregnancy, the EMEA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), at its April 2008 meeting, recommended that the product information should state that the use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be avoided in the first three months of pregnancy.The CHMP also confirmed that angiotensin II receptor antagonists must not be used during the second and the third trimester of pregnancy and that the contraindication already in place should therefore be maintained.Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are used in the treatment of patients with essential hypertension (high blood pressure that has no identifiable cause).The CHMP conclusions stem from a safety review conducted by the EMEA's Pharmacovigilance Working Party. This review included also a large number of non-centrally authorised medicines. Implementation of the recommendations for non-centrally authorised medicines will follow through the appropriate national procedures.-- ENDS --Notes:Three angiotensin II receptor antagonists are currently available in centrally authorised medicines: irbesartan, telmisartan and valsartan.Centrally authorised medicines containing Irbesartan are Aprovel, Karvea, Irbesartan BMS and Irbesartan Winthrop. Irbesartan is also available in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in the following centrally authorised medicines: Coaprovel, Karvezide, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Winthrop.Centrally authorised medicines containing telmisartan are Micardis, Pritor and Kinzalmono. Telmisartan is also available in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in the following centrally authorised medicines: MicardisPlus, PritorPlus and Kinzalkomb.Valsartan is available in combination with amlodipine in the following centrally authorised medicines: Exforge, Copalia, Dafiro and Imprida.

18532,EMA_NEWS_2647,2018-08-22,Keeping medicines safe,"How EMA monitors medicines once they are on the marketAfter its authorisation a medicine is used by many patients, often together with other medicines. Over time, certain side effects may emerge that have not previously been identified. It is therefore essential that the safety of all medicines is continuously monitored throughout their use in healthcare practice.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) protects public and animal health in the European Union and the European Economic Area by analysing information on possible side effects from new clinical studies, scientific publications and reports from doctors, pharmacists and patients.To address new or increased risks linked to a specific medicine, EMA can recommend a range of actions to protect public and animal health - ranging from restricting the medicine's use to taking it off the market.For an easy introduction to how the Agency monitors medicines, watch this video.For further information, consult our webpage on pharmacovigilance."

The Commission explained that after considering all the available evidence and being satisfied with the company's remedial actions, it has decided to close the case. Further information is provided in the Commission's statement published today.The infringement procedure was started by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 23 October 2012 at the request of the European Commission in the context of Commission Regulation (EC) No 658/2007, the so-called Penalties Regulation. The aim of the inquiry was to investigate allegations that Roche failed to comply with its pharmacovigilance obligations in relation to 19 of its centrally authorised products.This inquiry was triggered by a pharmacovigilance inspection carried out in 2012 by the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which identified serious shortcomings of the pharmacovigilance processes of Roche.The initial EMA investigation report was finalised on 14 April 2014 and forwarded to the company, the Member States and the European Commission. Upon transmission of the investigation report, the procedure continued at European Commission level. In July 2015, the European Commission returned the file to EMA for an additional inquiry and for further examination of certain facts. The Agency then sent, on 1 July 2016, the final updated report to the European Commission summarising its findings.The Commission has now closed the case.In a written statement submitted to the Commission, Roche said:""Roche accepted all the inspection findings. It took them extremely seriously and fully understands the EMA's and Commission's concerns. It has worked diligently to remediate the deficiencies as quickly as possible and also to enhance the company's medical compliance and PV systems to prevent any recurrence. While it has come a long way, the company knows that its efforts to enhance its systems and to maintain the trust of all stakeholders must continue. It is committed to working with the authorities to ensure it becomes, and then remains, a leader in the field."""

11868,EUROJUST_PR_0108,2010-06-22,People smuggling network disrupted," Page ContentThe Hague, 22 June 2010 With the support of Europol and Eurojust, English, French, German and Hungarian police officers today arrested 31 suspected facilitators of illegal immigration. One arrest was made in the UK, 13 in France, 5 in Germany and 12 in Hungary. 42 premises were searched in the early hours of this morning. The majority of those arrested were of Vietnamese origin but there were also several arrests of EU nationals. In total 66 immigrants from Vietnam were found during the house searches. 31 of these have already been confirmed as illegal immigrants whilst identities of the rest still have to be established. This pan–European investigation started 14 months ago. The investigations, supported by Europol, focused on suspects who smuggled illegal immigrants mainly from Vietnam into the EU, with a so–called ‘full guarantee’. This implied that the people were given guarantees that they would reach their final destinations, even where previous smuggling attempts had failed. The price for the entire guaranteed journey was up to 40 000 euros and could take anything from a few days up to many weeks. The families of the illegal immigrants would often sell their houses and property to fund the journey, resulting in substantial debt. Having done this, they would receive the full guarantee from the facilitators. One of the modus operandi used by this network was that they provided the immigrants with travel documents and valid visas that were issued on false grounds, with the help of involved consular officials. Once the immigrant arrived in Europe the travel documents were handed back to the criminal network. Various routes were used by the immigrants, such as flights from Vietnam to airports in Austria, the Czech Republic or Hungary. The immigrants were then transported onwards over land, hidden in trucks, to France and Germany. Another route involved flights into Romania and Bulgaria and then onwards via trucks or cars to Hungary or the Czech Republic, and from there by car to France. Eurojust was involved in assisting the coordination of the investigations and the exchange of information between the Member States involved. In April 2010 a coordination meeting was hosted by Eurojust in The Hague. Europol experts were present at the coordination centre to provide technical expertise and operational analysis support. During the investigation phase, Europol prepared several intelligence reports and facilitated the exchange of information. New criminal links were discovered by Europol in close cooperation with national experts.

12065,EUROJUST_PR_0305,2016-10-14,Action against an organised criminal group involved in thefts of luxury cars," Page Content​The Hague, 14 October 2016 ​On 11 October, a joint action day run by French and German police authorities, and supported by Eurojust with a coordination centre, succeeded in stopping an international organised criminal group (OCG) involved in thefts of luxury cars. The modus operandi of the OCG shows that the suspects broke into car owners' private homes to steal their car keys. The suspects played different roles in the OCG, ranging from stealing the cars, forging identity documents, and driving the vehicles to Germany. The investigation started in June 2016, when a Roma camp was dismantled in northern France. The investigation revealed links to other cases in which the French authorities of the Tribunal de Grande Instance (TGI) Le Havre investigated two car thefts, and discovered that the cars were stolen in France and sold to customers in Germany for low prices. Between 2012 and 2015, 17 car thefts were under investigation by JIRS Lille, France. The OCG is allegedly involved in the theft of an estimated 100 cars meant for resale in Germany. Eurojust provided support at various stages of the investigation, offering the opportunity for France and Germany to discuss and elaborate a common judicial strategy and find the most efficient response. Two coordination meetings were organised by and held at Eurojust in 2016. A joint investigation team (JIT) was formed between France and Germany in January 2016, with Eurojust providing funding for the JIT, enabling long-term cooperation and coordinated covert operations, which eventually led to the planning of the joint action day. Europol supported the action day by being present in Germany and France. Eurojust’s support proved crucial in dismantling the OCG, speeding up the entire operation and facilitating information exchange between the authorities involved.

12075,EUROJUST_PR_0315,2016-06-28,Eurojust and Ukraine sign an Agreement on Cooperation," Page ContentThe Hague, 28 June 2016 ​Yesterday, at a ceremony at the European Commission, Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, and the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Mr Yuriy Lutsenko, signed an Agreement on Cooperation in the presence of Ms Věra Jourová, EU Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. Conclusion of a cooperation agreement with a third State usually leads to a greater number of cases between the third State and Eurojust. With the inclusion of Ukraine, Eurojust has signed nine such cooperation agreements to date. Cooperation with third States is a crucial element in combating serious crime, particularly organised crime and terrorism. In practice, cooperation agreements enable the exchange of operational data, including personal data, in line with European standards on data protection. They also provide for the possible secondment of a Liaison Prosecutor from Ukraine to Eurojust. In 2004, Ukraine appointed two Eurojust contact points. The agreement also provides that Ukraine will designate a contact point as Ukrainian National Correspondent for Terrorism Matters. President Coninsx commented:Cooperation with third States is essential to deliver cross-border justice. Since 2005, Ukraine has been involved in 70 Eurojust cases, 26 coordination meetings, one coordination centre and one JIT. In this respect, the conclusion of this Agreement on Cooperation is a vital step in further strengthening cooperation with Ukraine. We are very pleased to have Ukraine joining our network of third States with which Eurojust has signed a cooperation agreement. Prosecutor General Lutsenko said:Developing a relationship with this EU organisation will give us many opportunities for international cooperation. BackgroundUkraine is a priority EU partner within the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership. The European Union and Ukraine signed an Association Agreement in 2014. The signing of the Agreement on Cooperation was in the framework of a visit of President Poroshenko and a large Ukrainian delegation, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who signed an agreement on scientific and technical cooperation with Commissioner Carlos Moedas. © European Commission   Related linksUkraine Security Service’s visit to Eurojust Agreement on cooperation between Eurojust and Ukraine  For further information regarding Eurojust's activities, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre)   "

11736,EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0397,2018-04-20,Caucasian mafia organisation committing burglaries and retail thefts in France and Greece dismantled thanks to first-ever joint investigation team between the two countries," On 17 April 2018, more than 30 suspects, including the 4 leaders of the organised crime group, composed of Georgian and Armenian nationals, were arrested after simultaneous operations of the French and Greek judicial and law enforcement authorities in Caen and Thessaloniki. Several coordination meetings held at Eurojust led to the first joint investigation team agreement ever signed between France and Greece on September 2017. Eurojust provided substantial logistical and financial support to the joint investigation team, which culminated in the establishment of a coordination centre at Eurojust's premises in The Hague. The common action day was coordinated by Eurojust with the support of Europol, allowing for real-time exchange of information and cross-checks of the evidence gathered against Europol's databases. The transnational organised crime group (OCG) is believed to be a predominantly Georgian mafia organisation called 'Vory V zakone', suspected of having committed thousands of burglaries and retail thefts in the Normandy region as well as in Greece. It is estimated that the OCG committed on average 13 shoplifting acts in France and 3 house breakings in Greece a day, causing a severe damage of several millions of euros. The OCG, whose sponsors were located in Greece, was hierarchically structured and governed by rigid rules, including the provision of capital to the 'obshak', a fund used as a common financial deposit for criminal activities. Background Eurojust is the European Union's hub for judicial cooperation and coordination between Member States, assisting in the investigation and prosecution of cases involving serious organised cross-border crime. The judicial cooperation tools that Eurojust offers to national authorities include coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams. Joint investigation teams are established between the national authorities of two or more Member States to coordinate and enhance ongoing national investigations through sharing of case-related information and evidence. In 2017, Eurojust supported 200 JITs and provided EUR 1.31 million in funding to JITs.   For more information about Eurojust, see www.eurojust.europa.eu or contact Eurojust's Corporate Communications Unit at media@eurojust.europa.eu.

11497,EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0158,2020-04-03,Eurojust remains fully operational during coronavirus crisis," Undiminished support for national authorities in the fight against cross-border crime The Hague, 3 April 2020     While Europe and other parts of the world are coping with the coronavirus crisis and its consequences, criminals continue to pursue their illegal activities. Some of them are even expanding their heinous business by ruthlessly taking advantage of the current situation. In these challenging times, Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, remains fully operational and continues its support for national authorities in the fight against serious cross-border crime.   In the beginning of March, a number of business continuity measures were swiftly activated to ensure the Agency's services also in a situation of remote working. Eurojust quickly adapted its infrastructure and critical processes to ensure that its laptops could provide secure access to the case management system, as well as advanced videoconferencing, including interpretation via secured channels. In the period 13  31 March 2020: 202 new cases were opened by National Members of Eurojust, each case initiating cooperation among countries involved in a specific investigation of serious cross-border crime. This is only a slight decrease compared to the number of cases registered from 1 to 12 March (261), when the Eurojust building was still fully accessible; eight coordination meetings took place, one at Eurojust premises and the other seven via secure videoconferencing. Another four coordination meetings through videoconferencing are scheduled to take place in the next two weeks; Eurojust's coordination centre was deployed remotely to support a joint action day; 42 new grants for joint investigation teams were awarded by Eurojust to national authorities on 27 March 2020 for a total amount of EUR 470 000; ; and agreements for two new joint investigation teams have been signed. Ladislav Hamran, the President of Eurojust, said: While we are in the middle of a global health crisis, Eurojust is committed to ensure that also in these extraordinary times, we do not allow criminals to escape justice. In the past weeks, we have continued to bring prosecutors from all over the EU together in a virtual way. This reinforces our belief that the fight against cross-border organised crime calls for a profound digitalisation of the way we work, bridging any distance by using secure connections for videoconferencing and data exchange. Justice needs to be done under all circumstances. Background: Prosecutors and investigative judges tackling serious cross-border crime need to quickly find the right counterpart, coordinate their investigations, efficiently exchange information and solve a range of practical issues that regularly arise when using EU judicial cooperation tools, including the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and the European Investigation Order (EIO). Eurojust is a hub where national judicial authorities connect, work closely together and ensure solid judicial follow-up throughout the internal security chain, from the very start of the cross-border criminal investigation to the final verdict in court. Throughout the different stages of the investigation, Eurojust therefore offers tailor-made operational support: A rapid response, sometimes completed within a matter of hours, including connecting with key counterparts and preparation of formal judicial cooperation requests, including official translations. Complex forms of assistance and coordination mechanisms, which may be combined as required to support major operations: 	 the identification of key counterparts that need to be involved, for example to coordinate parallel investigations; the organisation of case-specific coordination meetings; the formation of joint investigation teams (JITs); and the planning of joint action days, steered in real time from the coordination centre at Eurojust. In 2019, nearly 8 000 criminal investigations of many forms of serious cross-border crime, including drugs smuggling, cybercrime, trafficking in human beings, theft, migrant smuggling, terrorism and many forms of economic crime, including money laundering, fraud and environmental crime, were facilitated through Eurojust.

11913,EUROJUST_PR_0153,2011-02-08,Large international operation against illegal immigrant smuggling networks," Page ContentThe Hague, 8 February 2011 Supported and co-ordinated by Eurojust and Europol, early this morning, police officers in five countries took action against a number of sophisticated criminal networks involved in the smuggling of illegal immigrants, mainly of Vietnamese origin. The countries involved in the operation were France (19 arrests), Germany (8), Czech Republic (2) and the UK (1). In total, 30 suspected criminal facilitators were arrested. Simultaneously, a similar action took place in Hungary; 5 suspects were arrested. France took action to dismantle a transit camp used by immigrants at Grande-Synthe, close to Dunkerque; 38 immigrants (14 of Vietnamese and 17 of various other nationalities) were intercepted in this camp, where they all lived in cramped conditions. Actions also took place in Lille, Paris, London, Prague, Berlin, Munich and Budapest, where several suspected safe houses and apartments were targeted. In France, an indoor cannabis cultivation farm was also discovered. The criminal facilitators who were the target of today’s operation offered their services to potential immigrants to travel illegally from Vietnam to the UK. The modus operandi was to provide the illegal immigrants with false documents, fly them via Moscow, and then smuggle them onwards via trains, automobiles or concealed in lorries into the EU. For those who wanted to go to the UK, a group of Iraqi Kurdish criminal facilitators offered this service from Belgium and France to the UK for approximately € 2.000 to 3.000. They arranged that the immigrants could cross the English Channel in a van with hidden compartments, or concealed among commodities in lorries. The criminal facilitators also used a more expensive method (€ 10.000 to 15.000 for guaranteed arrival), by obtaining via deceptive means Hungarian and Czech Schengen visas issued in Hanoi for business purposes. The immigrants were then able to take direct flights to Paris. The immigrants were accommodated in safe houses in Paris arranged by the criminal facilitators prior to the final leg of their journey to the UK. This was a sophisticated network with cells in Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, France, the UK and Vietnam. At Eurojust, for the first time, a co-ordination centre was set up to facilitate the exchange in real time of information between Eurojust, France and the other countries involved. The case was initiated by the French magistrate of the JIRS of Lille and supported by the Eurojust Case Management Team. The Europol Mobile Office was deployed on the spot in France and Germany during the operation and consisted of one illegal immigration specialist and one analyst at each location. Europol experts also provided technical expertise and operational analytical support throughout the investigation.

12103,EUROJUST_PR_0343,2017-11-10,Joint international operation against online piracy," Page ContentThe Hague, 10 November 2017  On 8 and 9 November 2017, Eurojust supported an international joint operation against online piracy criminal groups. This operation resulted in 2 arrests, one of which was based on a European Arrest Warrant, 73 searches and the seizure of several websites, servers, computers and electronic evidence. The joint operations were co-led by units specialised in cybercrime at the offices of the prosecutor generals of Frankfurt am Main and of Dresden, as well as the State Criminal Police of Hesse and Saxony, with the assistance of the German Federal Criminal Police. The operations were carried out in close cooperation with the judicial and law enforcement authorities of France, the Netherlands, Spain, Canada, San Marino and Switzerland. This international joint operation is the result of the investigations conducted in Germany against criminal networks suspected of managing the internet-based download portals www.usenetrevolution.info, www.town.ag and www.usenet-town.com, which illegally offered licensed or copyrighted materials (such as films, TV shows, software, computer games, music, e-books and e-papers), without paying the required fees to license or copyright owners. In total, the download portals provided illegal access to approximately 2 million links to licensed or copyrighted materials. The owners of the platforms managed to make an illicit profit of several million euros, and this copyright infringement created damages of approximately EUR 7,5 million. Through a coordination centre established at its premises in The Hague, Eurojust supported the international joint operations and ensured the transmission and execution of European Investigation Orders, rogatory letters and a European Arrest Warrant, as well as the swift exchange of operational information collected on the ground among all the judicial and law enforcement authorities involved. For further information about the German investigations, please see the press release of the prosecutor general of Dresden (in German).   Background: The following video explains the purpose and functioning of Eurojust’s coordination centres.

11451,EUROJUST_NEWS_0112,2020-09-23,Minister of Justice of Lithuania visits Eurojust," Mr Elvinas Jankevičius, Minister of Justice of Lithuania, met today with Eurojust’s President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, and Ms Margarita Šniutytė-Daugėlienė, National Member for Lithuania at Eurojust. The President discussed how Eurojust has remained fully operational during COVID times through the use of digital solutions, including virtual coordination meetings. He also raised the importance of the further digitalisation of justice in the EU and pointed to recent initiatives taken by the Commission in this respect. The President also expressed Eurojust’s gratitude for Member States’ clear recognition of the importance of Eurojust’s mission in the ongoing negotiations for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027. He stressed the need for appropriate funding in coming years to support expected continued growth in national judicial authorities’ operational needs to fight cross-border crime. The Minister raised the issue of extradition of EU citizens to third countries and said: ""The European Union must ensure the proper protection of its citizens against whom extradition requests have been made by third countries. This is especially relevant when such actions have a political aspect or if prosecution was not initiated on legitimate grounds. Up to now, a clear and consistent framework for cooperation between EU members in this area has not been established and there is an urgent need to create a legal mechanism for such synergies."" Mr Hamran said: ""Eurojust has unique expertise in the field of extradition. This is why earlier this year, the Justice and Home Affairs Council invited Eurojust and the European Judicial Network to analyse how cases of requests for the extradition of EU citizens by third States are handled in practice, in view of possible EU guidance to be developed by the Commission. We are keen to share our findings and welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate."" Ms Šniutytė-Daugėlienė further introduced the Minister to Eurojust’s judicial cooperation tools, such as coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams, and pointed to recent operational successes, including the dismantling of a criminal network operating in Lithuania, the UK and Ireland responsible for drug trafficking, money laundering and trafficking in human beings.

21897,EFSA_NEWS_0649,2011-06-25,EFSA stands ready to provide scientific assistance to European Commission and Member States on French E.coli outbreak," Scientists at the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are closely monitoring the latest E.coli outbreak in the Bordeaux region of France and preparing to provide scientific support to the European Commission in the analysis of scientific data related to this outbreak. EFSA scientists are liaising closely with staff at the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and are in touch with food safety authorities in Member States, in particular France and Germany. French authorities have reported 10 cases of patients suffering from bloody diarrhoea in the Bordeaux region of the country, five of them diagnosed with haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can be caused by Shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC). Preliminary bacteriological tests found the E.coli strain O104:H4 to be present in two of the cases. French officials said this was the same strain as that responsible for the outbreak in Germany associated with bean sprouts. They said an epidemiological investigation found that seven patients, who live in close proximity to each other, had attended an open day at a recreational centre in the commune of Bègles near Bordeaux on 8 June. Six of those were said to have eaten bean sprouts scattered on various dishes at the centre. EFSA is preparing to support the European Commission and Member States in epidemiological investigations regarding the French outbreak, in particular helping to trace back to the origin of the contamination and possible links to the German outbreak. Following the outbreak in Germany, EFSA, in cooperation with ECDC, issued public health advice on the prevention of diarrhoeal illness with a special focus on STEC. EFSA also issued scientific advice on options to mitigate the possible risks of food contamination and human infection from STEC, confirming existing advice on the importance of following good agricultural practices, and good manufacturing and hygiene practices as laid down in internationally recognised guidelines. "
21948,EFSA_NEWS_0700,2010-02-25,EFSA publishes second series of opinions on ‘general function’ health claims," EFSA has published a second series of opinions on a list of ‘general function’ health claims compiled by Member States and the European Commission[1]. Scientific experts on EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) assessed all available scientific data submitted to substantiate the 416 health claims. These opinions have been sent to the European Commission and to Member States which will ultimately decide whether to authorise these claims or not. The evaluations of the NDA Panel were positive when there was sufficient scientific evidence available to support the claim, such as those related to vitamins and minerals. Experts issued unfavourable opinions on most of the claims in the second series due to the poor quality of the information provided to EFSA including: lack of information to identify the substance on which the claim is based, e.g. “probiotics”; lack of evidence that the claimed effect is indeed beneficial to the maintenance or improvement of the functions of the body (e.g. food with “antioxidant properties”); lack of human studies with reliable measures of the claimed health benefit [2]. This is the second series of opinions on ‘general function’ health claims and the Panel is continuing its work on the remaining claims on the list. This phased approach has been adopted due to the very large number of claims received for evaluation and the requirement, for EFSA, to publish opinions soon after adoption in order to ensure transparency. In carrying out its work, EFSA combines similar claims (e.g. by substance and/or the benefit) in order to form coherent opinions. EFSA engages regularly with stakeholders and is aware of the importance of clarifying the process followed by the NDA Panel in the evaluation of claims. A briefing document describes how EFSA has followed consistent procedures for evaluation of Article 13.1 health claims, including the use of uniform scientific criteria for substantiation of claims and for the characterisation of foods. The document (updated on 17th November 2009) is available on EFSA’s website. Briefing document for Member States and European Commission on the evaluation of Article 13.1 health claims EFSA expects to complete this work by 2011 depending on the final number of claims received. EFSA is liaising with the European Commission to set out a more precise timetable for completing the work, taking into account any additional claims to be evaluated. NDA opinions on article 13 [1] General function’ claims defined under Article 13.1 of the Regulation 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on food include: the role of a nutrient/substance in growth, development and the functions of the body; psychological and behavioural functions; slimming and weight control or reduction of hunger, increase of satiety or the reduction of available energy from the diet. These claims do not include those related to child development or health or disease risk reduction. [2] The NDA Panel has no pre-established formula in relations to the number or type of studies required for substantiation of a claim; it takes all pertinent scientific data into consideration. In common with the standards used by Codex Alimentarius and the US Food and Drug Administration, human studies are central to substantiation and there is a hierarchy of evidence: randomised controlled trials followed by observational studies while animal studies or in vitro research may also be taken into account.

21511,EFSA_NEWS_0214,2017-12-12,Salmonella cases no longer falling in the EU," The declining trend of salmonellosis cases in the EU has levelled off according to the annual report on zoonotic diseases published today. Cases of Salmonella Enteritidis acquired in the EU have increased in humans by 3% since 2014 says the report, which is compiled by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In laying hens, the prevalence increased from 0.7% to 1.21% over the same period. “The increase shown by our surveillance data is worrying and a reminder that we have to stay vigilant,” said Mike Catchpole, ECDC’s Chief Scientist. “Even in a state of high awareness and with national control programmes for S. Enteritidis in place, there is a need for continuing risk management actions at the Member State and EU level,” he added. Marta Hugas, EFSA’s Chief Scientist, said: “The decrease of Salmonella has been a success story in the EU food safety system in the last 10 years. Recent S. Enteritidis outbreaks contributed to a change in this trend in humans and poultry. Further investigations by competent authorities in the field of public health and food safety will be crucial to understand the reasons behind the increase.” There were 94,530 human cases of salmonellosis reported in the EU in 2016. S. Enteritidis – the most widespread type of Salmonella, accounted for 59% of all salmonellosis cases originating in the EU and is mostly associated with the consumption of eggs, egg products and poultry meat. Campylobacter and Listeria Campylobacter, the most reported food-borne pathogen in humans, was detected in 246,307 people, an increase of 6.1% compared with 2015. Despite the high number of cases, fatalities were low (0.03%). Levels of Campylobacter are high in chicken meat. Listeria infections, which are generally more severe, led to hospitalisation in 97% of reported cases. In 2016, listeriosis continued to rise, with 2,536 cases (a 9.3% increase) and 247 deaths reported. Most deaths occur in people aged over 64 (fatality rate of 18.9%). People over 84 are particularly at risk (fatality rate of 26.1%). Listeria seldom exceeded legal safety limits in ready-to-eat foods. Salmonella food-borne outbreaks increasing The 4,786 food-borne disease outbreaks reported in 2016 represent a slight increase in comparison with 2015 (4,362 outbreaks), but the figure is similar to the average number of outbreaks in the EU during 2010–2016. Outbreaks due to Salmonella are on the rise, with S. Enteritidis causing one in six food-borne disease outbreaks in 2016. Salmonella bacteria were the most common cause of food-borne outbreaks (22.3%), an increase of 11.5% compared to 2015. They caused the highest burden in terms of numbers of hospitalisations (1,766; 45.6% of all hospitalised cases) and of deaths (10; 50% of all deaths among outbreak cases). Salmonella in eggs caused the highest number of outbreak cases (1,882). EU summary report on zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks 2016 Note to editors: The EFSA-ECDC report on trends and sources of zoonoses is based on 2016 data collected from all the 28 European Union Member States. Nine other European countries reported on some of the zoonotic agents (Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). Salmonella Enteritidis is the Salmonella serotype responsible for most salmonellosis cases and Salmonella food-borne outbreaks. It had been declining constantly since 2007 when the EU surveillance began and control measures in poultry were implemented. Data related to S. Enteritidis in this press release excludes cases associated with travel outside the EU. "
21895,EFSA_NEWS_0647,2011-06-30,EFSA publishes fifth series of evaluations of ‘general function’ health claims," On 30 June 2011 EFSA’s NDA panel[1] finalised the evaluation of all ‘general function’ health claims[2] due to be adopted by that date. With the publication of this fifth series of scientific opinions, EFSA adds an additional 536 claims to the 2,187 claims published to date. A remaining group of 35 claims will be published in July 2011. The European Commission and Member States will then consider EFSA’s scientific advice in deciding on the possible authorisation of such claims for food products. EFSA is liaising closely with the European Commission and stands ready to provide any further support which could be required in the assessment of ‘general function’ health claims. Of the 536 claims evaluated in this latest series, favourable outcomes include the relation between specific dietary fibres and blood cholesterol; cereal fibre and bowel function; carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks and endurance performance; low sodium and blood pressure; dietary fibre and reduced increase in blood glucose after meals; melatonin and sleep onset and very low calorie diet in relation of body weight.  Other claims in this series received unfavourable evaluations because NDA Panel experts concluded that they were not sufficiently specific, such as claims on “women’s health” or “mental energy”, or that they referred to food categories which were considered to be too broad, such as “fruits and vegetables”, “dairy products”, to be linked to specific effects. Other claims were unfavourably assessed because they were not supported by any relevant studies in humans. Such studies are central to the establishment of a cause and effect relationship between the food or substance concerned and the beneficial health effect claimed. This series of opinions will be followed by a sixth series of assessments of 35 claims in July 2011. Notes to editors Out of the 4,637 claims submitted to EFSA by the European Commission between July 2008 and March 2010, the European Commission asked EFSA to evaluate 2,758 claims by June 2011, 331 claims were withdrawn and 1,548 claims on “botanicals” have been placed on hold by the Commission pending further consideration on how to proceed with these. Timeline of publications of EFSA’s evaluations in this area: 1st October 2009, 521 health claims addressed in 94 opinions 25th February 2010, 416 health claims covered in 31 opinions 19th October 2010, 808 health claims, addressed in 75 opinions 8th April 2011, 442 health claims, addressed in 63 opinions 30th June 2011, 536 health claims, addressed in 73 opinions July 2011, 35 health claims addressed in 5 opinions [1] EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies. [2] ‘General function’ claims defined under Article 13.1 of the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on food include: The role of a nutrient/substance in growth, development and the functions of the body; psychological and behavioural functions; slimming and weight control or reduction of hunger, increase of satiety or the reduction of available energy from the diet. These claims do not include those related to children's development or health or disease risk reduction. "
21994,EFSA_NEWS_0746,2009-04-06,EFSA publishes first four opinions on smoke flavourings," The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published the first in a series of opinions on flavouring products which are added to foods to give a “smoked” flavour. EFSA’s CEF Panel[1] concluded that the use of the flavouring product Smoke Concentrate 809045 was not of safety concern, however, it expressed safety concerns over the use of two other flavouring products – Unismoke and Zesti Smoke Code 10. These findings were based on exposure estimates for all of the smoke flavourings which are used in the European Union, which were also published in a separate opinion today. Klaus-Dieter Jany, the Chair of the CEF Panel, said: “With regard to Unismoke and Zesti Smoke Code 10, the Panel concluded that there were insufficient margins of safety between estimated exposure to the two flavouring products and intake levels above which they may cause adverse health effects. However, the Panel concluded that the margins of safety for Smoke Concentrate 809045 were wide enough. In all three cases, the Panel considered that studies were sufficient to remove concerns over genotoxicity – in other words, damage to the genetic material of cells.” EFSA’s exposure estimates – which looked at cumulative exposure to the different flavouring products in different categories of food, based on proposed uses and use levels supplied by the manufacturers – indicated that exposure mainly arises: for Unismoke, through meat and meat products, as well as soups and sauces; for Zesti Smoke Code 10, through meat and meat products, fish and fish products, composite foods (such as casseroles and meat pies) and processed fruits and vegetables; for Smoke Concentrate 809045, through meat and meat products, soups, sauces, protein products and ready-to-eat savouries. Studies showed that Unismoke and Zesti Smoke Code 10 caused adverse health effects in rats above certain intake levels. Due to the absence of data on reproduction and developmental toxicity and the lack of long-term studies on these two flavouring products, the CEF Panel concluded that the uses and use levels specified by their manufacturers would require larger margins of safety. Smoke Concentrate 809045 was found to cause no adverse health effects in rats at the highest levels tested. Notes to editors Smoking is traditionally used to help preserve certain foods such as dairy products, fish and meat. Over time, changes to the flavour of foods brought about by smoking have become more important than its preservative function. Smoke flavourings are now added to change the flavour of various foods, including many which are not traditionally smoked. The European Commission has asked EFSA to assess the safety of the smoke flavourings which are used or intended for use in the EU in order to draw up a list of authorised flavouring products. EFSA is due to publish opinions on eight further smoke flavourings by the end of 2009.

21582,EFSA_NEWS_0300,2016-08-09,EFSA reviews maximum content of copper in animal feed," EFSA has proposed modifications to the maximum levels of copper in feed for some animal groups. It recommends a reduction in the maximum copper content in feed for piglets, cattle and dairy cows, and an increase in feed for goats. The proposed levels would reduce the amount of copper released into the environment, which could potentially play a role in reducing antimicrobial resistance. EFSA’s Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) recommends that copper content in complete feed for piglets should not exceed 25 mg per kg (down from 170 mg/kg). The maximum content of copper in complete feed for dairy cows and cattle should be reduced from 35 mg/kg of feed to 30 mg/kg, the Panel says. For most other animal groups the currently authorised upper levels are unchanged except for goats where the Panel recommends an increase. The recommended levels are considered sufficient to satisfy the nutritional needs for copper of these animal groups. The FEEDAP Panel’s work is based on an extensive systematic literature review and data collected from Member States and stakeholders. The Panel estimates that the reduction of copper in feed for piglets would reduce the release of copper into the environment through manure by 20%. In the scientific opinion, EFSA experts also suggest that reducing copper in feed could help to reduce antimicrobial resistance in pigs and in the environment. This is because some studies indicate – as one of several hypotheses – that the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance could potentially be linked to the genetic proximity of some antibiotic and copper resistance genes. Revision of the currently authorised maximum copper content in complete feed "
21812,EFSA_NEWS_0563,2013-03-27,Mechanically separated meat: EFSA advises on public health risks and detection methods," Microbiological and chemical hazards associated with mechanically separated meat derived from poultry and swine are similar to those related to non-mechanically separated meat (fresh meat, minced meat or meat preparations). However, the risk of microbial growth increases with the use of high pressure production processes. These are some of the findings of a scientific opinion published by EFSA on public health risks related to mechanically separated meat. EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards also developed a model to help identify mechanically separated meat and differentiate it from other types of meat. Mechanically separated meat is derived from the meat left on animal carcasses once the main cuts have been removed. This meat can be mechanically removed and used in other foods.There are two main types of mechanically separated meat: “high-pressure” mechanically separated meat, which is paste-like and can be used in products such as hotdogs; and “low-pressure” mechanically separated meat, similar in appearance to minced meat. EFSA’s opinion concludes that possible microbiological risks associated with mechanically separated meat are similar to those related to non-mechanically separated meat.  Microbiological and chemical risks arise from the contamination of raw materials and from poor hygiene practices during meat processing. However, high pressure production processes increase the risk of microbial growth. In fact these processes result in greater muscle fibre degradation and an associated release of nutrients which provide a favourable substrate for bacterial growth. In relation to chemical hazards, experts from EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the food chain advise that no specific chemical concerns are expected provided that Maximum Residue Levels are respected. The Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) considered different parameters to distinguish mechanically separated meat from non-mechanically separated meat. The BIOHAZ Panel found that, based on currently available data, calcium (released from bone during processing) is the most appropriate chemical parameter. EFSA’s scientific experts developed a model which uses calcium levels to support the identification of mechanically separated meat products. This model will assist policy makers as well as food operators and inspectors in differentiating mechanically separated meat from non-mechanically separated meat. In order to improve the differentiation between mechanically separated meat obtained through low pressure techniques and hand deboned meat, EFSA recommends the use of specifically designed studies to collect data on potential indicators. Scientific Opinion on the public health risks related to mechanically separated meat (MSM) derived from poultry and swine    Notes to editorsWhen high-pressure methods are used, the carcass or the meat parts are pressed through a machine-like sieve. When low-pressure methods are used, the meat is mechanically scraped from the carcass. Currently in the EU, mechanically separated meat can be produced from poultry and pork but not from bovines, sheep and goats. Mechanically separated meat must be clearly labelled as such and does not count as part of the stated meat content of the product. High pressure mechanically separated meat must be immediately frozen and can only be used in cooked products. See Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin. "

22038,EFSA_NEWS_0790,2008-04-02,EFSA opinion on four substances used to decontaminate poultry carcasses: Assessment of effects on bacterial tolerance and antimicrobial resistance," EFSA has carried out an assessment on whether there is any increased bacterial tolerance and resistance to antibiotics from the use of four antimicrobial substances used to decontaminate poultry carcasses1. The EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) concluded that, despite a long history of use, no published data exist to indicate that the four substances, within the proposed conditions of use, will lead to increased bacterial tolerance to these substances or to increased resistance to therapeutic antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents. The Panel also encouraged further research on the likelihood of an increase in bacterial tolerance to these types of substances, and the possibility of their resistance to therapeutic antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents. The BIOHAZ Panel noted that there was some evidence indicating bacterial tolerance to other antimicrobial substances or biocides2 which were not subject of this Opinion. However, these data were either based on laboratory experiments which do not always mirror “real-life” situations or resulted from the improper use of biocides. EFSA delivered several opinions in 2005 and 2006 in relation to these four antimicrobial substances which looked at both the safety of using them on food and their effectiveness in killing or reducing bacteria. In evaluating the four substances, EFSA’s Panel on additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food(AFC) concluded that, based on the data available, there was no safety concern, within the proposed conditions of use. For its part, the BIOHAZ Panel looked at the effectiveness of one of the four substances, peroxyacids, and said that, owing to lack of sufficient data available to the Panel, including those submitted by the applicant, it was unable to say if these substances effectively killed or reduced bacteria on poultry.

32289,EASO_NEWS_0095,2016-12-06,Two new studies highlight the significant contribution of EU Agencies to citizens and administrations," The 45 EU Agencies and Joint Undertakings make a vast contribution to the economic and political development of the European Union according to two new studies presented today during the EU Agencies Forum at the European Parliament. The studies highlight that while the EU Agencies represent less than 0.8% of the EU’s annual budget their contribution has widespread impact at citizen, industry and policy level. The first study analyses the cost-effectiveness of the seven EU Agencies operating to support the Internal Market, and how they reduce the overall costs to taxpayers. The second study focuses on the contribution of 44 Agencies and Joint Undertakings to the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda.The studies will be discussed today and tomorrow during the first EU Agencies Forum at the European Parliament. Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness and Kristalina Georgieva, Vice-President of the European Commission, are speakers at the event.  António Campinos, Executive Director of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) which is currently Chair of the EU Agencies Network, said: “The EU Agencies are the familiar face of the EU for many Europeans, delivering essential services on the ground for a relatively small proportion of the overall EU budget - less than 0.8%, to be exact. In other terms, they cost €1.23 euros per EU citizen. The cost benefit ratio is hence very positive, and as the EU Parliament study has shown, agencies save national administrations many millions every year, by delivering synergies and preventing duplication of efforts in each Member State.""  Agencies are cost effective and save moneyOverall, the 2015 budget of the EU Agencies represents less than 0.8% of the EU’s annual budget (about €1.2 billion), while creating significant efficiencies and delivering value for EU citizens across a wide range of policy areas, according to a report by Deloitte (link). A second report commissioned by the European Parliament estimates that it would cost Member States up to €200 million a year to assume the tasks currently done by just seven of the 45 agencies1 (link).Agencies are close to EU citizens and businesses As well as supporting the top political priorities of the European Union, EU Agencies play an important role in many other aspects of the everyday life of citizens: in disease prevention and control, security and defence, education and knowledge, stability of the financial systems, and in the fields of digital connectivity or transport, among others. In 32 cities across 24 Member States, EU Agencies work to improve the EU industry and citizens’ lives in many ways. For example:Frontex, the European Border and Coastguard Agency, currently deploys some 1 200 officers at EU’s external borders and has helped to rescue more than 89 000 people at sea so far this year;The European Asylum Support Office currently deploys over 300 staff in around 20 locations in Italy and Greece. They are working to support the implementation of the EU Relocation Programme and EU-TR Statement. EASO has an important role in better managing the Common European Asylum System;In 2015, Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, supported more than 40,000 investigations against terrorism and serious crime; The EU’s Intellectual Property Office’s study on the economic contribution of Intellectual Property Rights shows that IPR intensive industries in the EU now support directly or indirectly 38% of jobs and 42% of the EU’s GDP; Since 2010, the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) has created Europe’s largest innovation community, helped set up 32 innovation hubs across Europe, and supported the creation of more than 200 innovative start-ups and entrepreneurship training for 2,000 students and graduates;From 2014-2020 the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking is administering €3.7bn investments in bio-based innovation and will be funding more than 200 cooperative projects through cross-industry clusters;The EMCDDA (EU drugs agency in Lisbon), monitors over 560 new psychoactive substances through an EU Early Warning System. Where required, it assesses the risks of these substances to public health in Europe;The European Medicines Agency has recommended over 1000 new medicines for the treatment of patients. In addition to monitoring approved medicines, it also addresses the challenges holding back the development of new medicines, including new antibiotics.NOTE FOR EDITORSThe two studies on EU Agencies and Joint-UndertakingsThe first study on “The Cost of Non-Agencies with Relevance to the Internal Market” was requested by the Budget Committee of the European Parliament and prepared by the Centre for Strategy & Evaluation Services (link). It shows that the Agencies reduce the overall costs to taxpayers. This report is a snapshot covering just seven agencies: The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO);The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA); The European Medicines Agency (EMA);The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA);European Banking Authority (EBA);The European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA);The European Insurance & Occupational Pensions (EIOPA).The European Banking Authority (EBA); The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA);The European Insurance & Occupational Pensions (EIOPA). The report shows that it is significantly more cost effective to perform a task once at EU level than to replicate it 28 times at national level.  The second study on “How do EU Agencies and Bodies contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy and to the Juncker Commission Agenda?” (link) was commissioned by the EU Agencies Network from the consultants Deloitte. It looks at how the EU agencies and bodies contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy and the Juncker Agenda. The EU Agencies Network The 45 decentralised Agencies and Joint Undertakings of the EU closely interact and cooperate within the EU Agencies Network, a Pan-European network, set up by the Heads of EU Agencies, as a collective voice for the Agencies to coordinate, exchange information and agree common positions of shared interest.For more informationFor more details about the Forum, see the Agenda.Follow the EU Agencies and the event on Twitter via #EUAgencies and #euagenciesforumClick here and find out more about how the 45 EU Agencies and Joint Undertakings.Watch videos about the EU Agencies on YouTube here.Press contactsDorottya VannaiMobile: +34 671 61 45 88Tel: +34 965 137 136Dorottya.VANNAI@ext.euipo.europa.eu Ruth McDonald Mobile: +34 606 157 278Tel: +34 965 13 8934Ruth.MCDONALD@euipo.europa.eu_______1The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO); The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA); The European Medicines Agency (EMA); The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA); The European Banking Authority (EBA); The European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA); The European Insurance & Occupational Pensions (EIOPA).

As with the TST, many uncertainties remain with regard to the efficacy of the IGRAs. It is therefore essential to secure an accurate understanding of these assays‘ known efficacy, so that they be optimally used and only in context with proven effect. Apers L, Yansouni C, Soentjens P, Vekemans M, Bottieau E. Current Infectious Diseases Report Feb 2011 Description This review of published literature presents the characteristics of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in a travel clinic setting. It presents the most recent reviews and meta-analyses on accuracy of the IGRAs and compares it to that of the tuberculin skin test (TST), also taking into the consideration different population groups to consider when testing for LTBI. The data presented shows that the two commercially available IGRAs (QFT-GIT and T-Spot.TB) in general have a similar sensitivity and superior specificity as compared to TST. However, authors state that the replacement of TST for IGRAs is often not recommended by experts due to the many uncertainties that remain in interpreting IGRA test results, and that experts rather recommend the IGRAs be used in combination with the TST; a reflection of the lack of a gold standard for diagnosing LTBI. The uncertainties with regard to the IGRAs efficacy and role in diagnosing LTBI is further reflected in current policies and guidelines for TB testing in the USA, UK, Canada and the Netherlands, as presented in the current paper.  Authors conclude that for travel clinic practices, the choice of TST, IGRA or combination of TST and IGRA for diagnosing LTBI should reflect current policy guidelines, logistical and financial implications. Furthermore, authors highlight the importance that each patient’s place of origin, medical history and history of travel be considered when interpreting test results for LTBI. Public Health significance IGRAs are increasingly being considered for the diagnosis of LTBI, as a replacement to the TST, including travel medicine. As with the TST, many uncertainties remain with regard to the efficacy of the IGRAs. It is therefore essential to secure an accurate understanding of these assays‘ known efficacy, so that they be optimally used and only in context with proven effect.

33499,ECDC_OTH_0599,2013-04-14,Epidemiological update of 15 April: avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China,"Epidemiological update of 15 April: avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China Epidemiological update 14 Apr 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since the previous ECDC epidemiological update, 20 new cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported, including two fatalities in previously confirmed cases. The geographical spread includes two additional provinces: Beijing and Henan. Since 31 March 2013, sixty cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) have been reported from six provinces in eastern China with a combined population of about 330 million. Onset of disease has been between 19 February and 9 April 2013 in: Shanghai (24), Jiangsu (16), Zhejiang (15), Anhui (2), Henan (2)and Beijing (1). See Figure 1 below. The date of disease onset is currently unknown for five patients. Most cases have developed severe respiratory disease and only three cases are reported to have mild clinical course. Thirteen patients died (case-fatality ratio=21%). The median age is 65 years with a range between 4 and 87 years; 17 of them are females. The Chinese health authorities are responding to this public health event by enhanced surveillance, epidemiological and laboratory investigation and contact tracing. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus. The authorities reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) that avian influenza A(H7N9) was detected in samples from pigeons, chickens and ducks, and in environmental samples from live bird markets ('wet markets') in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang provinces. Authorities have closed markets and culled poultry in affected areas. The source and mode of transmission have not been confirmed. The outbreak is caused by a reassortant avian influenza virus with low pathogenicity for birds, hence it does not cause the signal 'die-offs' in poultry associated with highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses. Genetic analyses of the isolates have shown changes which suggest that the H7N9 virus may have greater ability to infect mammalian species, including humans, than most other avian influenza viruses. Pathogenicity for humans appears to be high and higher age appears to be a risk factor for disease. The most likely scenario is that of A(H7N9) spreading undetected in poultry populations and occasionally infecting humans who have close contact with poultry or poultry products but this will have to be validated as further data become available. At this time there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. More than 1 000 close contacts of confirmed cases are reported to have been followed up without evidence of person-to-person transmission. There is one family cluster with two confirmed cases for which human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out but where common exposure is the most likely explanation. The rapid geographic spread and the increase of confirmed cases is likely to be the result of strengthened case finding and increased testing. A(H7N9) test kits have been distributed to over 400 laboratories across China and this increased ascertainment is expected to provide important epidemiological information. An increasing incidence of sporadic cases and expansion of geographic spread in China and possibly neighbouring countries are expected over the coming weeks. Individual imported human cases to Europe cannot be ruled out and countries need to prepare for detecting and diagnosing such cases. Critical developments that would change this assessment would be evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission and detection of avian influenza A(H7N9) in bird populations in Europe. ECDC is closely monitoring developments and is continuously re-assessing the situation in collaboration with WHO, US CDC, China CDC and other partners. ECDC published an updated risk assessment on April 12.   Figure 1: Distribution of influenza A(H7N9) cases by province, China, as of 14 April 2013   Province Population, millions Cumulative count No of deaths First case reported Latest case reportedShanghai 23 24 9 31.03.2013 14.04.2013Jiangsu 79 16 1 02.04.2013 14.04.2013Zhejiang 54 15 2 03.04.2013 14.04.2013Anhui 60 2 1 31.03.2013 07.04.2013Beijing 30 1 0 13.04.2013 13.04.2013Henan 94 2 0 14.03.2013 14.04.2013TOTAL: 330 60 13 31.03.2013 14.04.2013     Figure 2: Distribution of influenza A(H7N9) cases by week of onset of symptoms, China, as of 14 April 2013   Figure 3: Distribution of cumulative number of influenza A(H7N9) cases by province, China, 19 February – 14 April 2013 Avian influenza virus China Influenza Influenza A(H7N9) virus Influenza in humans, avian origin Public health threat Zoonotic influenza Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail"
33037,ECDC_NEWS_0137,2018-03-21,"ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment highlights young adults and healthcare workers as groups that are susceptible to measles, 21 March 2018","ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment highlights young adults and healthcare workers as groups that are susceptible to measles, 21 March 2018 News 21 Mar 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC assesses the risk of measles transmission in the EU/EEA in latest rapid risk assessment. The latest ECDC rapid risk assessment on the risk of measles transmission in the EU/EEA highlights that vaccination coverage and occurrence of cases vary within countries and population groups. It points to the need for systems to identify and vaccinate young adults, who are increasingly affected and therefore increase measles circulation, but who may not be aware of their vaccination status. Finally, ECDC signals the frequency of cases amongst healthcare workers as a matter of concern and suggests that Member States may consider specific interventions to ensure this group is vaccinated. Measles cases occur unequally within countries Data showing the distribution of measles cases within countries (Figure 1) highlights the importance of vaccination coverage of at least 95% of the general population throughout a whole country with two doses of measles-containing vaccine. This is recommended and necessary to ensure that measles circulation is interrupted, and that introduction of measles cases does not result in secondary cases. The availability of data at subnational level allows identification of geographical areas where measles cases are occurring and where targeted actions may be needed to identify unvaccinated individuals, increase coverage rates and carry out response activities. Figure 1. Subnational distribution of measles cases per million population by place of notification*, EU/EEA, 1 January 2017–31 December 2017 *For Denmark, subnational notification rates are based on place of residence. For Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, Iceland, Luxembourg and Norway, the notification rates by country are presented, as reported in TESSy.   Measles increasingly affects young adults who may not be aware of their vaccination status Some countries have seen an increasing proportion of cases among adults, prompting the need to consider actions to identify people or pockets of susceptible individuals who are incompletely vaccinated or not vaccinated at all. In light of current outbreaks in several EU countries, individuals who have not been vaccinated with two doses of measles-containing vaccine are at risk of contracting and further spreading measles, especially to infants who are too young to be vaccinated and are more vulnerable to complications from the disease. Healthcare providers should consider recommending vaccination for all eligible individuals who are not immunised, or not fully immunised, in line with national recommendations. Any encounter with the healthcare system should be used as an opportunity for a catch-up vaccination against measles as well as other vaccine-preventable diseases. Frequency of measles cases amongst healthcare workers a matter of concern The frequent occurrence of measles among healthcare workers in several EU/EEA countries is a matter of concern and Member States may consider specific interventions to address this, such as ensuring that all healthcare workers are immune to measles, with proof/documentation of immunity or immunization as a condition of enrolment into training and employment.   EU/EEA Measles Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail"
32905,ECDC_NEWS_0005,2020-02-26,COVID-19: ECDC updates case definition for EU surveillance,"COVID-19: ECDC updates case definition for EU surveillance News News story 26 Feb 2020 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Following the rapid increase of coronavirus cases in Italy, ECDC continuously assesses the impact that those local clusters have on the overall risk of further spread in the EU/EEA. In addition, the Centre supports the Member States in their COVID-19 preparedness and response efforts. At this stage, it is likely that Europe will see similar developments like in Italy, varying from country to country. To address these scenarios, ECDC constantly updates its risk assessments for Europe and provides guidance for the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and authorities to respond to the outbreak. Following the recent detection of COVID-19 clusters in Italy, ECDC’s support included issuing guidance for hospitals and healthcare workers on how to manage COVID-19 cases and how to protect themselves when taking care of patients as well as for environmental cleaning. On 25 February 2020, ECDC also updated the case definition for EU surveillance of COVID-19 outlining the criteria for suspected cases who should be tested. These include patients presenting with acute respiratory infection (whether mild or severe) who in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms have met at least one of the following criteria: close contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 infectionor having stayed in areas with so-called presumed community transmission. ECDC reviewed the list of countries and areas of presumed community transmission which now also includes the four regions in northern Italy. Pasi Penttinen, ECDC expert in infectious diseases, stresses how travellers can help prevent further spread of COVID-19: “This outbreak is a global issue now and good coordination is vital. There is also something everyone can do: when you are travelling to or living in areas with presumed community transmission - which we outline in our assessment - follow strict hygiene measures such as regularly washing hands with water and soap or using alcohol-based hand sanitisers. When you come back from such an area, monitor your health status for a period of 14 days after your return. If you experience any respiratory, flu-like symptoms during that period, contact a healthcare specialist. Ideally do so via telephone first and indicate your travel history before you seek medical attention in person and sitting in waiting rooms with other people. If you have any symptoms, please avoid contact with other people until you have consulted a healthcare specialist.” Read more Case definition and European surveillance for COVID-19, as of 2 March 2020 Case definition for EU surveillance of COVID-19.

33526,ECDC_OTH_0626,2013-02-07,"Epidemiological update: multistate outbreak of Salmonella Stanley infection, 30 January 2013","Epidemiological update: multistate outbreak of Salmonella Stanley infection, 30 January 2013 Epidemiological update 7 Feb 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In July 2012, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) initiated a Europe-wide investigation on a Salmonella Stanley outbreak, together with the affected Member States, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Reference Laboratory for Salmonella (EURL Salmonella). Cases were associated with strains showing an indistinguishable PFGE pattern not previously reported in Europe. Epidemiological and microbiological outbreak investigation at the European Union level In July 2012, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) initiated a Europe-wide investigation on a Salmonella Stanley outbreak, together with the affected Member States, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Reference Laboratory for Salmonella (EURL Salmonella). Cases were associated with strains showing an indistinguishable PFGE pattern not previously reported in Europe. Between July and September 2012, ECDC encouraged European Union (EU) and other European Economic Area (EEA) Member States to perform Xbal-PFGE typing on all S. Stanley human isolates. The image profile of the outbreak strain was shared with all EU countries. ECDC collected and analysed molecular typing data on S. Stanley from EU/EEA Member States to explore potential sources of infection within the food production chain in this multi-country outbreak. Following the publication of the joint ECDC/EFSA rapid risk assessment on 20 September 2012, ECDC suggested to the EU/EEA Member States to perform PFGE typing only on a subset of isolates, and to report to ECDC the number of non-travel associated S. Stanley cases on a monthly basis, regardless of travel history within or outside the EU. The objective of this update is to monitor the evolution of the outbreak. Although the case definition for this monitoring purpose is broader than during the intensive phase of the outbreak (higher sensitivity), the epicurve provides an indication of the development of the outbreak. ECDC will provide a monthly update of the situation in the EU/EEA until the outbreak is considered over. Ten EU Member States have had cases with PFGE results matching the PFGE outbreak profile. These countries were asked to provide the number of non-travel related cases of S. Stanley (i.e. probable and confirmed cases) identified per month between 1 August 2011 and 23 January 2013. From 2007 to 2011, an average of nine cases of non-travel related S. Stanley infections were reported monthly to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) in EU/EEA Member States. Epidemiological update Between 1 August 2011 and 23 January 2013, 684 cases of non-travel-related S. Stanley infections (probable and confirmed cases*) were identified in the EU: Hungary (235), Austria (186), Germany (77), Belgium (41), the United Kingdom (64), Czech Republic (35), Sweden (18), Italy (14), Slovak Republic (12), and Greece (1) (Figure 1). * See case definition at the end of the document Figure 1: Distribution of cases of non-travel-related Salmonella Stanley infections (probable and confirmed cases*) by Member States and month of report, August 2011 – January 2013, as of 23 January. (n=684) The monthly number of cases reported has decreased consecutively from the peak in August 2012 (n=133) to December (n=16), and is  close to the pre-outbreak rate (n=9/month). As the exclusion criteria refer to PFGE testing, and probable cases have not been tested by PFGE, the overall number of case reports shown here may slightly overestimate the actual size of the outbreak. Additionally, the antibiotic resistance pattern of some probable cases suggests that they are not part of the outbreak, although comparison of resistance patterns is not as reliable an epidemiological marker as PFGE testing. In spite of these uncertainties for a small fraction of cases, the pattern of epidemiological curve provides essential information on the resolution of this outbreak. Microbiological update Comparative molecular epidemiological analyses of human, food, animal and environmental isolates’ PFGE fingerprints performed by ECDC and the EURL Salmonella corroborate the available epidemiological evidence. This provides additional evidence that strongly supports the conclusions of the ECDC/EFSA rapid risk assessment of 21 September 2012, in particular the implication of the turkey production chain as the probable main source of the outbreak. Conclusions The number of cases represented in this update provides an indication of the trend of the outbreak. The monthly number of cases has decreased for five consecutive months towards the pre-outbreak rate, suggesting a reduction in exposure to the vehicle for the infections. However, the monthly number of non-travel related cases reported in December in the 10 affected countries exceeds the pre-outbreak rate observed for the EU as a whole. Therefore the outbreak cannot yet be considered as over. ECDC will monitor the monthly number of cases in affected countries again next month to confirm the end of the outbreak. If this is achieved, surveillance for re-emergence of the outbreak will be achieved thereafter through updates from EU Member States to ECDC, e.g. via the Epidemic Intelligence Information System for Food and Waterborne Diseases (EPIS-FWD), and through analysis of trends in reports of non-travel related S. Stanley submitted to TESSy by Member States.

32979,ECDC_PR_0079,2018-11-15,ECDC calls for continued action to address antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings,"ECDC calls for continued action to address antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings Press release 15 Nov 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On European Antibiotic Awareness Day, ECDC publishes the results of two point-prevalence surveys of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in hospitals and in long-term care facilities in the EU/EEA. The findings show that practices in terms of antimicrobial use vary from country to country throughout Europe and that, overall, there is room for improvement. Furthermore, healthcare-associated infections remain a serious issue, with 8.9 million occurring each year in both hospitals and long-term care facilities. Overuse of antimicrobials – mostly antibiotics – and varying infection prevention and control practices may result in the increased emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the EU/EEA.  Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “The rising number of   Europeans who are dying or who become disabled from infections that are resistant to antimicrobials is of great concern to me and to the European Commission. We can avoid many of these deaths by stopping the unnecessary use of antimicrobials in healthcare and in agriculture, and through better diagnosis and prevention of infection in healthcare settings and communities. I am proud of the work that our partners in EU Member States, together with the European Commission and the EU agencies, do to implement the European One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance. I call on everyone who has influence on the prevention and treatment of infections to redouble their efforts to combat this threat”.   The studies showed that there still are sources of unnecessary use of antimicrobials in hospitals and in long-term care facilities. In hospitals, the proportion of broad-spectrum antimicrobials used varied from 16% to 62% across Europe. These medicines are not always necessary and their use drives antimicrobial resistance. In addition, more than 50% of antimicrobial courses for surgical prophylaxis, i.e. antimicrobials given to patients to prevent infections in relation with surgical procedures, lasted more than one day although continuing antimicrobial prophylaxis after the end of intervention is not recommended. In long-term care facilities, 29% of antimicrobials were prescribed for prophylaxis, and 74% of those courses were given to prevent urinary tract infections. While this might reduce the risk of infection in women, there is no evidence about its effectiveness when applied widely to elderly patients. The surveys also confirm that healthcare-associated infections remain a public health issue in the EU/EEA. ECDC estimates that on any given day one in 15 patients in European hospitals, and one in 26 residents in long-term care facilities, have at least one healthcare-associated infection. Many of them were caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.   Andrea Ammon, ECDC Director, stated: “With 33000 deaths each year as a consequence of an infection due to bacteria resistant to antimicrobials and EUR 1 billion in annual healthcare expenditure, we need to ensure that these medicines are used prudently and that infection prevention and control measures are in place in all healthcare settings across Europe”. She added: “Since the rates of antimicrobial resistance, the rates of antimicrobial consumption as well as infection prevention and control practices vary from country to country, it is essential to tailor strategies to address specific needs. ECDC calls for continued action at all levels”. Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe said: “Human, animal, and environment health are all equally responsible for the correct use of antimicrobials and to avert the threat of antimicrobial resistance. As we strive to ensure that these medicines are rightly used in the community and in healthcare settings, one sector alone will not solve the problem. “One Health” brings together professionals in human, animal, food and environment health as one force, and as such is the only way to keep antimicrobials working. I call on all European countries to secure the highest commitment to this approach from the whole of society and the whole of government”. Point prevalence surveys A prevalence survey is a count of the number of patients with a particular condition/treatment (in this case either a healthcare-associated infection or an antimicrobial agent) at a particular time (in this case a day), as a proportion of the total number of patients who are hospitalised at that particular time. In 2016-2017, ECDC coordinated the second point-prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals. the third point-prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European long-term care facilities.

Health burden of antibiotic resistance An ECDC study on the health burden of antibiotic resistance, published on 5 November 2018, estimated that about 33000 people die each year in the EU/EEA as a direct consequence of an infection due to bacteria resistant to antibiotics and that the burden of these infections is comparable to that of influenza, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined. It also explains that 75% of the burden of disease is due to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and that reducing this through adequate infection prevention and control measures, as well as antibiotic stewardship, could be an achievable goal in healthcare settings.

Dieleman J, Romio, S, Johansen K, Weibel D, Bonhoeffer J, Sturkenboom M. Guillain-Barré syndrome and adjuvanted pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 vaccine: multinational case-control study in Europe BMJ 2011 Due to an association that was observed in the United States between a swine-flu based human influenza vaccine developed in 1976 and the disease acute polyneuropathy Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (1,2), GBS was one of the adverse events that was monitored in Europe and North  America (3) following the 2009 influenza pandemic vaccination campaigns. A scientific investigation has been conducted by ECDC and VAESCO (coordinated by the Brighton Collaboration, Switzerland and data analysis performed by the Erasmus University, The Netherlands), comprising Public Health authorities and academic research groups  in five European countries (Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK) is described here. Cases of GBS (and its variant Miller-Fisher syndrome) were identified through medical electronic databases or neurologist networks in respective countries and a common study protocol for the case-control study was used. For confirmation of cases, a case definition developed by the Brighton Collaboration was used.(4) Based on a source population of around 50 million individuals, the investigators identified 104 validated GBS cases, which could be matched to one or more controls with a date of first symptoms between November 2009 and the end of March 2010. Each case was matched with up to 25 controls and for age, sex, date of onset and country. Data were collected for a series of potential risk factors, including influenza like illness and other respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal infection and previous GBS, all described to be associated with a new onset of GBS. Most cases were men aged 46-61 years and were classified according to the Brighton case classification level 1 to 3. Acute infections in the six weeks leading up to the index date were more common in cases than in controls, most commonly influenza-like illness and upper respiratory tract infections. Exposure to pandemic influenza vaccination was confirmed by primary care records in a period from one day to six weeks before the date of onset of symptoms. Various different vaccines were used, but predominantly adjuvanted vaccines in line with those included in the national pandemic vaccination campaigns. An unadjusted pooled risk estimate was statistically significant at an odds ratio of 2.8 (95% confidence interval of 1.3 to 6.0). However after controlling for risk factors such as influenza-like illness and upper respiratry tract infections, as well as seasonal influenza vaccination, no increased risk was observed and the odds ratio declined to 1.0 (0.3 to 2.7). ECDC Comment (July 13th 2011) ECDC and its collaborators have already estimated background GBS incidence rates to be used in observed versus expected analyses in the safety monitoring of the 2009 pandemic vaccination campaigns. Other adverse events included in the monitoring were anaphylaxsis, convulsions and idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP). The findings of the current European study are welcome and not unexpected. An earlier study in the UK found no association of the pre-pandemic seasonal vaccine and GBS; in fact the vaccine was almost protective against GBS.(4,5) Another previous study by the American CDC found the same lack of any statistical association for the non-adjuvanted pandemic vaccines used in the United States with GBS. (3) That the study was undertaken even more expeditiously in the United States is to be expected given their prior experience from 1976, where one additional case of GBS occurred for every 105 swine-origin influenza vaccinations.(1,2) GBS  was considered to be a possible adverse event based on previous experience with swine-flu containing influenza vaccines. For this reason, Europe and the United States prepared to look for it. ECDC and its collaborators (the European Medicines Agency (EMA), VAESCO and national authorities) are also investigating a possible association between one of the adjuvanted 2009 pandemic vaccines and narcolepsy-cataplexy in children and adolescents.(5,8) These investigations will take more time because of the lack of basic epidemiological data, however they will certainly be tackled with the same independence and scientific rigour as for GBS.(7)       Schonberger LB, Bregman DJ, Sullivan-Bolyai JZ, Keenlyside RA, Ziegler DW, Retailliau HF, et al.

Cases reported in the EU were autochthonous human WN fever cases (neuro-invasive and non neuro-invasive), meeting laboratory criteria as per EU case definition (Directive 2008/426/EC) and all reported cases outside the EU. The first cases of West Nile fever (4 cases) were reported on 31 May 2013 by the office of epidemiology of the Astrakhanskaya oblast, in the Russian Federation. These cases occurred during the first decade of May, almost one month earlier than in 2010-2012. As of 6 November 2013, 226 human cases of West Nile fever (including 150 neuro-invasive infections) have been reported in the EU; 16 cases in Croatia, 86 in Greece, 31 in Hungary, 69 in Italy and 24 in Romania. In neighbouring countries, 557 cases have been declared in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Israel and Tunisia. In the EU, Greece has still been the most affected country with 86 cases. Nine areas reporting cases have been displayed on the map. Italy has reported more cases than in the previous years and 15 provinces were affected, including some of the most populated provinces in the north of the country and a newly infected province in the south. Hungary, Romania and Croatia have reported 31, 24 and 16 cases, respectively. In these countries, the respective capitals were affected. In the neighbouring countries, most of the cases have been reported from Serbia where 302 cases have been detected in 18 districts, including the capital, Grad Beograd. A large number of cases have also been reported from the Russian Federation (177 cases in 11 oblasts and the Adygeya Republic) and from Israel (63 cases). In addition, sporadic cases have been reported from Bosnia and Herzegovina (3 cases), the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (1 case), Montenegro (4 cases), Tunisia (6 cases) and Ukraine (1 case). Since 25 October, no recent cases have been reported. With the decrease of mosquito populations’ activity, the season of West Nile virus transmission to humans is now coming to an end in the EU and neighbouring countries.

Of those, two were identified in the Federal District and 44 in the state of Hidalgo. However, media reports mention up to 81 confirmed cases: 77 in the state of Hidalgo, two in the state of Mexico and two in the Federal District, which is the most populated area of Mexico. Of the cases where information was available, 44% are male and 56% are female, age ranging from two to 82 years old; 30% have been hospitalized. This is the first sustained autochthonous transmission of cholera recorded since the 1991-2001 endemic period. These infections are caused by Vibrio cholerae O:1 Ogawa toxigenic. The strain is different from the one that circulated in Mexico during the 1991-2001. Genetic testing suggests this strain to be similar to the strain currently circulating in Haiti, Dominican Republic and Cuba. Travellers to Mexico should be aware of preventive hygiene measures and seek advice from travel medicine clinics prior to their departure, to assess their personal risk. In addition, physicians in the European Union should consider the diagnosis of cholera in returning travellers from Mexico presenting with compatible symptoms. Upon diagnosis, notification to the relevant public health authorities is essential.   In Cuba, according to the same update, 678 confirmed cholera cases, including 3 deaths, have been reported from July 2012 through August 2013. The affected provinces are Camaguey, Granma, Guantanamo, Havana, and Santiago de Cuba. Twelve of the confirmed cases had travelled to Cuba from other countries (two from Chile, two from Germany, three from Italy, one from the Netherlands, two from Spain, and two from Venezuela).

Today, the European Antibiotic Awareness Day received the European Health Award, a prize awarded each year by the European Health Forum Gastein. The European Health Award honours initiatives aiming to improve public health or healthcare in Europe. It was established in 2007 to promote cross-border cooperation, multi-country working and the development of sustainable, innovative and transferable initiatives which address current challenges such as disparities in health status, access to services and the provision of treatment within Europe. This year, six cross-border health projects were short-listed for the European Health Award. The prize-winner was chosen by an independent panel of leading health experts. ECDC Acting Director Dr. Andrea Ammon said: “This award is recognition that the European Antibiotic Awareness Day has made a significant contribution to raising awareness of prudent antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance as priorities for governments and health authorities across the European Union and beyond.” European Antibiotic Awareness Day is a health initiative coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which aims to provide a platform to support national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics. The goal of the European Antibiotic Awareness Day is to provide the participating countries with evidence-based tools, as well as technical and political support for their campaigns. In 2015, with the support of WHO/Europe, 41 European countries organised activities to mark the initiative. Participation has grown steadily since the first EAAD in 2008 to which 32 European countries participated.

33833,ECDC_OTH_0933,2011-05-10,The extinction of dengue through natural vulnerability of its vectorsArchived,"The extinction of dengue through natural vulnerability of its vectorsArchived ECDC comment 10 May 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Aedes aegypti is a highly specialized mosquito species feeding predominantly on humans and breeding in artificial water holding containers in urban areas, and currently restricted to subtropical and tropical areas. Williams et al. focus on the reasons why Ae. aegypti once occurred in locations where the mosquito does not occur anymore in Australia, the more temperate drier parts of the country. Williams CR (1), Bader CA (1), Kearney MR (2), Ritchie SA (3), Russell RC (4).PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases 2010 Dec 21; 4(12):e922. Background: Dengue is the world's most important mosquito-borne viral illness. Successful future management of this disease requires an understanding of the population dynamics of the vector, especially in the context of changing climates. Our capacity to predict future dynamics is reflected in our ability to explain the significant historical changes in the distribution and abundance of the disease and its vector.  Methodology/principal findings:Here we combine daily weather records with simulation modelling techniques to explain vector (Aedes aegypti (L.)) persistence within its current and historic ranges in Australia. We show that, in regions where dengue presently occurs in Australia (the Wet Tropics region of Far North Queensland), conditions are persistently suitable for year-round adult Ae. aegypti activity and oviposition. In the historic range, however, the vector is vulnerable to periodic extinction due to the combined influence of adult activity constraints and stochastic loss of suitable oviposition sites. Conclusions/significance: These results, together with changes in water-storage behaviour by humans, can explain the observed historical range contraction of the disease vector. For these reasons, future eradication of dengue in wet tropical regions will be extremely difficult through classical mosquito control methods alone. However, control of Ae. aegypti in sub-tropical and temperate regions will be greatly facilitated by government policy regulating domestic water-storage. Exploitation of the natural vulnerabilities of dengue vectors (e.g., habitat specificity, climatic limitations) should be integrated with the emerging novel transgenic and symbiotic bacterial control techniques to develop future control and elimination strategies. VBORNET comment: 2011-03-16 Aedes aegypti is a highly specialized mosquito species feeding predominantly on humans and breeding in artificial water holding containers in urban areas, and currently restricted to subtropical and tropical areas. Williams et al. focus on the reasons why Ae. aegypti once occurred in locations where the mosquito does not occur anymore in Australia, the more temperate drier parts of the country. By means of mechanistic models (using CIMSiM), they challenge the idea that the historic range is climatically suitable for long term Ae. aegypti survival. They show that in some locations, the mosquito, for example, could only survive when permanent water holding containers were present. When prevalence of water tanks decreased, Ae. aegypti persistence reduced remarkably. Of course the reverse is also possible. In Europe, until the beginning of the 20th century, the yellow fever mosquito was present in many areas and sea-ports along the Mediterranean coast, but disappeared rapidly during the 1950’s. To our knowledge no report provides convincing evidence why this had happened. The current study might provide clues that the species became extinct through its natural vulnerability in this region. Recently Ae. aegypti has established itself again on the island of Madeira (Portugal) through reintroductions by trade activities as well as on the north-eastern Black Sea coast. Expansions of the distribution of this mosquito due to global warming are expected, but other unidentified non-climatic factors might preclude this from happening. Generally, Ae. aegypti is not anticipated to reach as far north as Western Europe as it cannot withstand freezing temperatures. This study, however, makes you wonder whether man made changes or habits allow this mosquito to establish in apparently climatic unsuitable locations, as once seen in Australia. The authors conclude that Ae. aegypti is naturally vulnerable for extinction in certain conditions and that this vulnerability should be exploited in control programmes especially in subtropical and temperate regions. Yet, considering the increasing importance of Ae.albopictus as vector of dengue in these regions, it adds a level of complexity to such control programmes.

By doing that, he added, VET will achieve higher visibility and recognition in the community and among key stakeholders. Mr Calleja was addressing over 150 participants from UNESCO/UNEVOC Member States as well as key international players in technical vocational education and training (TVET). Speakers proposed measures countries should take in TVET to place education and training at the core of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. TVET has the potential to contribute to creating sustainable economies and societies by preparing youth and adults for employment, entrepreneurship and by promoting gender equality and social equity. The Cedefop Director spoke about key factors preventing VET from achieving the attractiveness it deserves to inspire and empower youth through skills development. Quality assurance issues topped his list followed by the often unresolved issue of permeability between higher education and VET, the negative sociocultural perceptions of VET, the fear to implement reform and increase its visibility, learning environments not showing young people in compulsory education the value of VET programmes, teacher training which requires more structural organisation,  blinkered guidance and counselling for young adults, especially those who wish to take the VET learning pathway, poor job offers for persons with VET qualifications, disagreement at governance level on the complementarity between skills for life and skills for jobs, and failure to recognise informal and non-formal learning and assign credits that would enable VET mobility. According to Mr Calleja, these factors add to VET’s unattractive profile even though several Member States are increasing skills competitions and media campaigns to encourage enterprises to invest in VET. European initiatives, policies and tools that strengthen VET provision are also on the increase. A video message by UNESCO’s Director-General Irina Bokova opened the conference. Head of UNESCO/UNEVOC Shyamal Majumdar and UNESCO’S Director of policies and lifelong learning systems David Atchoarena spoke of the need to transform TVET systems for sustainable development linked to the 2030 sustainable development goals and UNESCO’s TVET strategy. Other speakers included Cedefop’s Bureau Member Peter Thiele, UNESCO’S Director of lifelong learning institute Arne-Carlsen and Vice-President World Skills International Jos de Goey. "

The project, which began in December 2008 and ended in December 2009, was promoted by Fondazione Giacomo Brodolini with Agenzia Liguria Lavoro, Agenzia Campania per il Lavoro and Regione Marche as partners. The aim of the project was to define and experiment a purpose-made methodology and set of indicators for integrated evaluation of the active ageing policies implemented in Italy in the light of the objectives set by the European Employment Strategy (EES). In fact, the EES includes, among its priorities, increasing the rates of participation of older workforce, and thus implementing actions for prolonging working life, but also preventing and curbing those processes of social exclusion that may be associated with age.In particular, the project pursued the following aims: • promoting an integrated approach for the monitoring and implementation of active ageing policies• formulating a methodological structure for integrated evaluation of all the active ageing strategies deployed in the various areas and their contribution to the overall objective• applying this model to the territory of the three Regions• communicating the results to the various parties involved.

5931,CEDEFOP_NEWS_1149,2016-02-23,Slovenia - scholarships for shortage occupations," Based on the amendments of the Scholarship Act from 2013, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia has introduced a Scholarships policy (2015-19). Its goal is to mitigate structural imbalances in the labour market over 2015-19 by encouraging youth and adult enrolment in upper vocational programmes for shortage occupations. EUR 1.2 million will be allocated to this purpose annually, financing jointly from the national budget and European Social Fund (ESF). Every year the Slovene human resources development and scholarship fund launches a call for 1000 scholarships for learners enrolled in vocational programmes for shortage occupations. Shortage occupations are those in a high demand, but with a deficit of qualified workers on labour market, and those with an anticipated gap between labour demand and supply. Trends indicate more structural imbalances for some secondary VET jobs with the retirement of qualified workers. Analyses by the Employment Service of Slovenia of areas of shortage occupations show that priorities are in handcraft, computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, food processing, construction, forestry, wood processing, chemical technologies and services (hotel management, catering and chimney sweeping). Shortage fields will be determined yearly by the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs in cooperation with social partners and youth representatives. Educational programmes for a support will be chosen annually based on labour market demands and enrolment in previous years. The Scholarship Act sets the scholarship rate at EUR 100 per month; this can be combined with other scholarships apart from those awarded by companies. In the school year 2015/16 there were 7,677 applications for 1000 scholarships.   Slovenia supports youth education through different types of scholarships. There are state scholarships for youth from socially disadvantaged families, and Zois' scholarships for talented students. The State also encourages companies to anticipate and address human resources gap by jointly funding scholarships to VET learners. A special scholarship is intended for Slovenians living abroad and for national minorities in Slovenia. More information: http://www.mddsz.gov.si/nc/en/newsroom/news/article//7676/ (in English) "
5589,CEDEFOP_NEWS_0809,2017-09-28,"Guidance must go to school, work and homes"," Image copyright:  SA Innove Rajaleidja/Pathfinder The international conference on lifelong guidance policy and practice, jointly organised by the Estonian EU Presidency, Foundation Innove and Cedefop as part of the first European guidance week (#EGW2017), brought over 200 experts in career services from 35 countries to Tallinn on 27 and 28 September. Speaking on the first day, Cedefop Director James Calleja argued that ‘guidance, which is like oxygen to learners, must leave its natural home, the school, and penetrate workplaces; it must ride on the potential of ICT and must not lose its humanistic approach dealing with individuals on a one-to-one basis.' In an age of technology and automation, career guidance is indispensable to the employability of both young people and older workers, said Mr Calleja. He added that the Presidency theme ‘unity through balance’ when applied to career guidance assumes a worrying reality faced with at least three common imbalances: the imbalance between the weight of technology and the burden of unskilled potential, the weight of success against the burden of school failure or early leaving, and the potential of ICT and the burden of inaccessibility to information, especially on trends to future jobs and skills. ‘No skills equals no jobs,’ Mr Calleja affirmed. Therefore Cedefop’s contribution to career guidance is not only significant but also developing through various initiatives that provide policy-makers with valuable information and policies, such as Skills Panorama, the online toolkit for early leaving and the recently launched CareersNet, a new network to share best practice support in career guidance. New reality In his welcome speech, Estonian Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Education Mart Laidmets said that guidance plays an important role in reaching the Europe 2020 benchmarks. He added that, as all communication is moving to the internet, relevant services to the citizens, such as lifelong guidance, must make the most of this new reality. Over 40 experts, researchers, hands-on specialists and policy-makers from across Europe made presentations and participated in discussions at the conference. Both days also featured workshops, aimed at identifying the most important lines of action. Cedefop expert Stelina Chatzichistou presented Skills Panorama, the skills portal set up by the European Commission and powered by Cedefop, at the session on better career mobility and labour market functioning. Call for action In the conclusions presented by Mr Laidmets at the final session, which included six recommendations, it was stressed that 'development of ICT in guidance and e-governance provides an opportunity for the Member States and the EU to provide better access and coherence of the services to all citizens. Lifelong guidance needs to be repositioned across the policy fields at national and EU levels, in particular taking into account the future of work and in preparing citizens for scenarios of employment, underemployment or no employment in a segmented labour market.' There was a call to the European Commission to 'take the lead in such repositioning and in developing an implementation strategy, taking into account the six recommendations of this Estonian Presidency conference, and using the EU guidelines for policies and systems development for lifelong guidance.' According to Foundation Innove’s Margit Rammo, within the scope of the Presidency, this was another great opportunity for Estonia to draw more attention to e-solutions for career guidance because international cooperation is key and a source of inspiration for generating innovative solutions. ‘This entire event is one of the outcomes of international cooperation: although Estonia is presiding in the EU, it would not have been doable without our partners and counterparts from European networks,’ Ms Rammo said and listed the European Commission, Cedefop and University of Jyväskylä in Finland as major partners. Improving services Cedefop guidance expert Pedro Moreno da Fonseca, who was in charge of the project on behalf of the agency, said of the need to organise a European guidance week: ‘This week of activities provided a unique opportunity for the guidance community to discuss ways to increase the relevance of its work to the ones who need it the most, such as the unemployed and the educationally disengaged. The potential of labour market intelligence (LMI) and ICT as elements to improve services to the citizen were key discussions. Cedefop’s tools to support the integration of LMI and ICT in guidance practices were piloted and results allow foreseeing good uptake and development. We also had positive reactions to CareersNet and the indication that its role in supporting peer learning and innovation will be successively achieved.’ New network In the framework of the week, Mr Moreno da Fonseca organised the first meeting of Cedefop’s new CareersNet network in Tallinn. EU Member States experts had the chance to exchange best practice in career guidance and come up with new ideas for cooperation. Addressing the participants, Cedefop Head of Department for Learning and Employability Antonio Ranieri underlined the fundamental role of experts in the network in increasing the quality of Cedefop’s research in lifelong guidance. He noted that CareersNet will decisively contribute to widening the contribution of this work in informing developments in other policy fields such as validation and adult learning. The European guidance week events are part of the 2017 European vocational skills week (#EUVocationalSkils), which is organised by the European Commission with Cedefop as a partner.

5351,CEDEFOP_NEWS_0570,2018-06-26,United Kingdom (England): encouraging school to apprenticeship transition," The Education and Employers charity has identified good practices that schools in England successfully employ to aid young people’s transitions from school to apprenticeships, during a period of time when the overall number of teenage apprenticeship starts has stagnated. The number of apprenticeship starts in England each year has nearly tripled in a decade (BIS, 2016), mainly because of an increase in adult apprentices. While more teenagers apply for apprenticeships, actual teenage apprenticeship starts are not rising. Careers advice Only 11% of respondents to the Education and Employers survey thought about and pursued the option of becoming an apprentice. Another poll of those aged 16-18 (YouGov, 2015) found that 31% had not received any careers advice on apprenticeships. Tip 1: The most successful schools in getting teenagers into apprenticeships give advice and guidance at a younger age than other schools, to allow plenty of time to consider future career options. Fig 1: Age that students were told about apprenticeships Source: Teenage apprenticeships: Converting awareness to recruitment   Employers responding to the project survey believe that there is a stigma associated with apprenticeships that means they are only being promoted to lower achieving students. School teachers may also be less confident in promoting apprenticeships due to a lack of relevant personal experience. Tip 2: Provide support to raise the confidence of school staff Gender stereotypes The Education and Employers survey identifies diversification of the workforce as one of employers’ key reasons for hiring teenage apprentices. Despite this, only one school in the project sample challenges gender stereotypes by promoting non-traditional job roles to young people. Tip 3: Early exposure to gender-awareness activities can encourage girls and boys to try apprenticeships they may not have considered otherwise. Parents 65% of young people think their parents prefer them to enter university rather than an apprenticeship (ACCA commissioned survey, 2015). The Education and Employers project discovered that few schools arrange events specifically oriented towards parents. Tip 4: Schools and colleges with a high number of successful apprenticeship applicants carry out specific events to engage parents as part of their careers provision. Businesses Education and Employers advises that careers events involving businesses have optimal impact when valued by young people. Tip 5: Schools and colleges with a high number of successful apprenticeship applicants invite current or ex-apprentices to show young people the progression and career routes available. Preparation Low attaining, white males from less socially advantaged backgrounds report that they are the most likely group to plan to apply for apprenticeships at age 19. However, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, particularly those with unemployed parents, are no more likely to become actual apprentices (Longitudinal Study of Young People in England). Employers report that young people often lack basic skills, attitudes and behaviours needed in the workplace, in addition to appearing immature and unreliable during interviews; consequently, they are reluctant to employ young people again (Ofsted, 2015). Tip 6: Many employers use assessment centres as part of their recruitment processes (CIPD, 2014). Schools and colleges should prepare young people to deal with the centres’ wider array of tests and exercises more confidently.

7115,CEDEFOP_NEWS_2340,2010-10-27,Guidance and counselling must adapt to the needs of ageing workers," Cedefop’s recent workshop on guidance for ageing workers reflected on the critical importance of this issue for Europe - and the complex questions policy-makers and researchers must address. The ageing of the workforce is one of the most worrying of Europe’s labour market trends. Throughout Europe, the younger cohort is shrinking while the share of older workers in the labour force is rising, leading to concerns about the sustainability of pension systems.  Government plans to raise the age of retirement have become a controversial issue in many countries. The spirited debate which characterised Cedefop’s recent workshop on guidance for ageing workers reflects the critical importance of this issue and the complexity of related questions that must be addressed. These range from identifying the correct research methods to tackling attitudes to ageing.  Indeed, the first obstacle is cultural.  Evidence from across the EU shows that employers do not give their ageing workers enough opportunities to stay on at work.  The data also point to significant differences between countries. In the UK, 60% of employers say that encouraging workers to work beyond 65 is a potential solution to future staff shortages. But only 12% of Dutch employers see this as a viable alternative. Policy-makers have some difficult riddles to solve. Foremost among them is how to offer lifelong guidance and otherwise encourage people to stay on at work, without appearing to introduce punitive measures.     One such measure is the retirement age. In some cases it is obligatory, leading to an abrupt age divide in the workplace. Policy makers and social partners need to examine whether this is still the way to go, or whether greater career flexibility – such as partial retirement - can ensure a longer working life, higher social acceptance, and greater intergenerational cooperation.  Another challenge is to find the best form guidance should take, and the optimum division of responsibility. Should employers take the lead, or is it up to governments? And what is the role of the workers themselves?   As workshop participants pointed out, policy-makers would do well to take interdisciplinary research into account in order to avoid pitfalls such as cultural stereotyping of older workers. Policy measures may include:      expanding counselling services that cater for ageing workers providing support for cross-sectoral cooperation in guidance provision encouraging closer social dialogue between employers and employees in this area   A related issue is how the guidance and counselling field itself can best face the rising demand for services for older workers.  The counsellors’ own initial education and continuing professional development must take this demand into account. But at the moment guidance services are scattered throughout many different bodies and are shaped by different regulatory frameworks. Policy makers can make a real difference by introducing standards that make guidance a more coherent profession.  They can also support the development of tools enabling counsellors to complement their traditional role: instead of only dealing with young people, they must be able to take on more responsibilities for the baby boomer generation. The old division of fixed ages for study/working life/retirement no longer accurately  describes how people live. Whether working within a company or in a public guidance service, the counsellor must take a highly individualised approach, understanding people’s aspirations and identifying a context in which they can thrive.  Guidance professionals must be prepared to suggest several options: alternating work with learning spells, a complete job change, a switch to another employer or self-employment and entrepreneurship.  Other issues:   To recognise skills that have been gained at work – i.e. experience - validation systems must be put in place. So far few countries have done so. Careful study of the data is needed to establish whether, and to what extent, training in itself helps people have longer careers. 2012 is the European year of active ageing. Given the importance of this issue for the economy and its repercussions on training, Cedefop plans to focus particularly on adult learning and ageing workers between 2012 and 2014. *** The workshop, Supporting longer working lives: Guidance and counselling for ageing workers took place on September 30-October in Thessaloniki.   Next year, Cedefop will publish a compilation of the papers presented.  Also in 2011, the Centre will launch a Europe-wide study on guidance for active age management.    Picture: Cedefop conference on guidance for ageing workers, left to right: Margaret Malloch (Cass School of Education), Jasper van Loo and Mika Launikari (Cedefop)     "
6450,CEDEFOP_NEWS_1663,2013-09-13,"Germany: VET data: first university entrance qualification, then apprenticeship"," Some 2.5 million students ‒ a record high in enrolment rates at German universities. At the same time, more and more young people who have acquired university entrance qualifications decide against going to university and opt for vocational education and training (VET) instead, as current data show. Export hit from Germany? Cars and machines, of course. But also apprenticeship steadily climbs up the hit list. Several European countries, like Spain, are introducing apprenticeship-type schemes to alleviate youth unemployment. In US President Obama’s view the asset of this system is that young Germans can acquire a vocational qualification and be job-ready by the end of upper secondary education. To obtain similar qualifications, young Americans need to attend a community college after high school. In 2011, 2.6 % of the apprentices in Germany had not completed ISCED level 2, almost every second had completed Realschule (usually 10 years of schooling) and approximately every fourth had completed Hauptschule (9 to 10 years of schooling). However, 22.1 %, more than one in five, people commencing a VET programme could have chosen to study at a university or university of applied sciences, say the statisticians. From 17.7 % in 2005 the number of VET learners holding a university entrance qualification has steadily increased. This can be explained by the general rise in the number of persons eligible to study at university. In 2011, this increase was particularly dramatic. In Bavaria and Lower Saxony, following a change in the duration of upper secondary general education, two age groups passed their exams to gain university entrance at the same time. Conscription was also abolished. Hence, a hitherto unseen number of first semester students flooded German universities. VET also benefited from this situation, even though the rush was less than that hitting the universities. According to the Federal Statistical Office, 524 000 of a total of 741 000 people who took up VET in 2011, opted for an apprenticeship, combining practical work in an enterprise with study at a vocational school. The remaining 30% chose one- to three-year programmes that are mainly school-based to become wood sculptors, foreign language assistants, chefs or physiotherapists, for instance. Contrary to apprentices, learners in these programmes are not remunerated. "

Researchers, project partners and stakeholders from the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Italy, Austria and the United Kingdom presented their products and outcomes developed within the TrainCom project. Fundación Tripartita para la Formación en el Empleo is the Spanish project partner. Learning outcome orientation in VET has been the focus of TrainCom. The term ‘learning outcome’ was introduced in European debates in response to a need for increasing transnational transparency and mobility. Creating a common language eases communication across system borders and helps to transfer learning from one context to another. Learning outcome orientation has become an important element of systemic development in many countries’ education and training policy. It also influences curricula development. The use of competence-based learning units contributes to VET quality, but training staff needs to be involved in shaping competence-based learning. The main product of TrainCom is a multilingual online learning platform for competence-based VET. It provides information and inspiration to VET teachers and trainers who are in charge of developing or redesigning programmes. Five phases of competence-based training (CBVET) are covered: planning and organising CBVET; carrying out work-based learning; monitoring and documenting learning outcomes; assessing competences; supporting learning and guidance. The platform provides detailed information on how to carry out each phase and offers tools and examples of good practice from training providers, companies and training centres, in the participating countries. TrainCom’s final conference was a good opportunity for national and European experts to discuss and exchange views on recent national developments regarding EU policies in apprenticeships, work-based learning, learning outcomes, and competence-based learning, and answer questions, such as: what actions are planned to foster apprenticeship models? what actions are planned to increase VET quality? what actions are planned to decrease youth unemployment?

The selection criteria were: quality of VET provision, number of students in particular sectors, regional distribution of schools, and balanced geographical representation of future centres. In the near future, the centres of competence will be established in five priority areas: tourism and hospitality, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and ICT, health care and agriculture. Over EUR 130 million from the European Structural and Investment (ESI) funds will be invested in state-of-the-art equipment for the future centres, boarding rooms for VET students and teachers, expanded opportunities for work-based learning and more successful transition of VET graduates to the labour market, closer cooperation with employers and advanced teacher training opportunities. Centres of competence will serve as hubs of excellence in VET with particular focus on work-based learning. Established with the support of ESI funds, the centres of competence will offer VET programmes to students, as well as professional guidance and continuous professional development and training to professionals, VET teachers and workplace mentors. Main features will include innovative learning opportunities, excellence of teachers and workplace mentors, state-of-the-art facilities, and intensive cooperation with local enterprises and other VET stakeholders. Relying on long-standing European best practices in VET, the establishment of centres of competence in Croatia is also in line with the Strategy of Education, Science and Technology, the VET system development programme 2016-20, and the Act on VET 2018 amendments. The future network of centres of competence is a unique opportunity to increase investment in VET in Croatia, encourage cooperation and networking among VET schools, higher education institutions and enterprises, promote quality and innovation in VET, and advance students’ professional and entrepreneurial competencies.

The ""youth guarantee"" is intended to provide for a smooth transition between school and work, to support labour market integration and to make sure that no young person is left out. The measure is a key part of the response to the worsening youth employment conditions across Europe. Links 3226th Council meeting - press release "

To introduce and implement the new ideas, various training events have been planned. - First training aimed at those responsible for curricula at schools: lead teachers for curricula groups, department heads and leaders of the broad group of studies. The training will give a thorough overview regarding the changes forthcoming in the evaluation system and their importance in the context of applying the output-based curriculum. - Then training for the modular teams, where teams are expected to be composed of people from every curriculum group of every VET institution. That team will support the curriculum group in the future and will be leading the transfer to the new approach to evaluation. One of the sub-activities of the program ""Developing the content of VET 2008-2013"" is working out the unified concept for evaluation and training of assessors. In May 2010, an evaluation concept task force was set up whose main responsibility was to work out the principles of evaluation in VET and the implementation of a unified methodology to assess learning outcomes.

6584,CEDEFOP_NEWS_1808,2013-01-17,Lithuania: traineeships of vocational teachers in enterprises," In November 2012, a group of vocational teachers from the wood processing sector started in-service training in enterprises. The opportunity is provided via the ESF-supported project ‘Development and implementation of the system for improving the technological competences of vocational teachers and lecturers’ (Profesijos mokytojų ir dėstytojų technologinių kompetencijų tobulinimo sistemos sukūrimas ir įdiegimas). During the project training programmes were prepared to broaden vocational teachers’ technological competences needed for designing and manufacturing wood products and furniture and for working with modern equipment and materials. Vocational teachers will be introduced to technological innovations of wood processing technologies, sectoral development trends and will prepare a project for improving VET curricula. Afterwards such traineeships will be organised for vocational teachers from engineering, food production, construction, transport and many other sectors. It is planned that in total 650 teachers from vocational schools and colleges will have participated in traineeships by the end of 2013. The coordinator of the three-year project is the Education Development Centre (Ugdymo plėtotės centras). During the project a model for VET teachers’ technological competence improvement has been developed based on the experience of previous pilot projects. The model suggests elements of the in-service training system, funding, a scheme for stakeholder cooperation, etc. It was developed on the basis of a comprehensive survey of managers in VET providers and vocational teachers/lecturers on competences required for technology training. In cooperation with employers and their organisations 100 vocational teacher training programmes in 12 sectors of the economy were developed. Training according to these programmes will be organised in leading companies under the supervision of employees of enterprises. "

5397,CEDEFOP_NEWS_0617,2018-05-14,Luxembourg: new TEVA barometer monitors professional integration," In March 2018, the TEVA barometer went online. This is a new tool allowing better monitoring of the integration of graduates from vocational and technical school programmes into the world of work.   The TEVA barometer provides detailed data for 65 VET jobs and professions and for nine sections and three divisions in technical secondary education. It is intended for use by education and guidance professionals, as well as pupils and their parents, while looking for early career development opportunities based on their qualification. Twenty key indicators sum up the early careers of young graduates, which are divided into four stages: leaving school (rate of school-leavers getting a job); first job (proportion of young people obtaining a permanent contract for their first job, average duration of first job); employment during the first three years after leaving school (proportion of employment under temporary and permanent contracts by sector of activity, by size of company); employment after three years (rate of employment, median hourly wage). The new monitoring tool is an outcome of the TEVA study (Transition Ecole-Vie Active - transition from school to working life), carried out by the Training Observatory. This study analysed the early careers of recent secondary education graduates and monitored more than 5 000 of them from 2009 to 2015. The TEVA barometer is based on these data, which are updated annually to include each new generation of graduates. Read more: TEVA - Baromètre de l'insertion professionnelle   "

6215,CEDEFOP_NEWS_1432,2014-09-17,Germany - dual study courses grow continuously," Popularity of dual study courses remains unbroken. With 11.4 % in 2013, the AusbildungPlus (vocational education plus) database of the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BIBB) registered a two-digit growth rate in dual study courses for initial training. The database currently records 1014 dual study courses with simultaneous training in a company and at university (of applied sciences) or university of cooperative education. This figure is boosted by 447 additional study courses for continuing education. Students registered with AusbildungPlus increased from 41000 in 2004 to 64400 in 2013. In particular, universities expanded their dual study courses from 30 to 57 in the past year. Traditionally, dual study courses are mostly found in economics, engineering and computer sciences. However, the biggest growth took place in social sciences, where study courses on offer grew by almost a third to currently 41 courses registered in the database. This exceeds a growth rate of 24 % in the previous year. The main reason is demographically-caused demand for skilled professionals in the healthcare and nursing industry. With cooperation between at least two learning environments, dual study courses adopt a core principle of vocational education and training. In its position paper on dual study courses of October 2013, the Wissenschaftsrat (German Science Council) highlights significance of combining theory with practice. It defines the link between in-company and academic learning by way of corresponding curricula and organisation as a central quality criterion for dual study courses. BIBB President Friedrich Hubert Esser welcomes the position paper: ’The future challenge will be to establish quality standards regarding the link between in-company and academic learning in dual study courses.’ The Science Council's recommendation will be adopted to give direction to systematic registration of dual study courses in the central AusbildungPlus project database. More information: AusbildungPlus is a BIBB project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Its focal point is a database providing nationwide information on dual study courses and additional qualifications in the dual vocational education system. Wissenschaftsrat(German Science Council) provides advice to the German Federal Government and State (Länder) governments on higher education and research’s  structure and development.

4668,CEDEFOP_NEWS_0111,2013-12-16,Press release - Turkish photographer receives Cedefop / Photomuseum Prize," Cedefop Director James Calleja presented on Monday in Thessaloniki the Cedefop / Photomuseum Prize to Turkish photographer Aydin Cetinbostanoglu for his project ‘Diary of a village doctor’. Mr Calleja stressed ‘the truly international character of the prize’ and added that the award is ‘not only a way to support the art of photography but also to visualise vocational education and training and to draw attention to the big issue of today: how to bridge education and work’. Since 2007, Cedefop and the Thessaloniki Museum of Photography have been organising international competitions for the best photographic portfolio on the theme of working and learning.  The 2012/13 winner Aydin Cetinbostanoglu was chosen by an international jury consisting of Simon Edwards from the Maison Européenne de la Photographie, Elina Heikka, Director of the Finnish Museum of Photography, Jennifer Trauscher, who manages the Impossible Project in Vienna, Vangelis Ioakeimidis, Director of the Thessaloniki Photomuseum and Christian Lettmayr, Deputy Director of Cedefop. He received EUR 5 000 and his prize-winning work will be exhibited in Thessaloniki. The theme of the competition was ‘Learning for life, working to grow’. This collaborative effort by the two institutions draws attention to the themes of Cedefop’s mandate: training, skills, lifelong learning and the links between employment and education. Criteria for the award selection are mostly based on the creative and innovative capacity to interpret the theme. A winner of several awards in his career, Mr Cetinbostanoglu was born in Izmir, in 1954. He staged his first photo exhibition in 1973. He studied Political Sciences at Ankara University. He likes to share the happiness and sadness of human beings using his camera lens and to make friends while taking their pictures. He has made 22 personal exhibitions and has taken part in 20 group ones. In 2014, when Thessaloniki is the Youth Capital of the European Union, the theme for the Cedefop / Photomuseum competition will be ‘Reinventing the present: original jobs’.

5277,CEDEFOP_NEWS_0497,2018-11-15,United Kingdom: raising digital skill levels through partnerships," The Digital Skills Partnership was established for public, private and charity sector bodies in England to develop and deliver training that improves the digital skills of individuals and organisations as a whole. Demand for skilled workers in the digital sector is growing in the UK [1]. The UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has subsequently set up the Digital Skills Partnership to work on implementing the UK digital strategy. A multitude of digital skills training exist in the UK, so it is sometimes unclear to prospective learners and organisations which courses are best suited to their needs. An important part of the partnership’s work is to develop tools that can help identify digital skills needs through local partnerships and support more nationally coherent skills provision. The partnership is also tasked with predicting future digital skills needs in new and emerging markets. The first two local digital skills partnerships had started operations by the summer of 2018 as pilot projects covering the Lancashire and the Heart of the South West regions. Education and training providers can now collaborate within these local digital skills partnerships to avoid duplication of efforts and ensure training provision meets local needs. The partnership aims to raise digital skill levels of both adults and young people through basic digital training for beginners to advanced skills linked to specialist jobs. Skills provision is offered at three levels. Essential digital skills introduce adults and children to basic activities, such as turning on a computer and accessing services on the internet. General digital skills may be taught as part of the curriculum in schools, through workplace training or to adults who need to manage online accounts. Specialist digital skills refer to coding, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and digital marketing among others. These more advanced skills may be learned in schools, colleges and universities, but also through non-formal learning activities in clubs or in the workplace, and are often related to specific job roles. Employer engagement is vital to the success of the partnership, and businesses have been involved from the start. Strategic input and insights from key businesses ensure skills provision matches the demands of local employers and contribute to growing the local economy. Business links are being made through local enterprise partnerships. It is further the remit of the partnership to enable small businesses and charities to raise the skill levels of their workforce. The partnership also aims to bring industry and other partners together to update teachers on the digital skills and knowledge they need to teach. The digital skills partnership has created a work model comprising six main steps from recognition of skills needs, through delivering training, evaluating impact and sharing best practice, which aims to guide local partnerships. The guide – called a playbook – is a living document that may be updated by individuals and organisations participating in the partnership. [1] Tech Nation (2015). Business structure database. "

The major objective of creating a competence-based, modular qualification system through issuing a reformed OKJ (in February 2006) was to adapt VET to labour market demands. The number of qualifications in the new register has been reduced considerably, and the new system allows for obtaining partial qualifications which gives early school leavers a better chance to re-enter VET. By identifying specialized 'built-on' (rpls) vocational qualifications, it also creates a better linkage between IVET and CVET and thus facilitates continuing training.

Cedefop has been producing regular skills forecasts, looking into employment trends of sectors, occupations, and qualifications, for over a decade now. Over the same period, Eurofound has been running the European job monitor, producing proxies of, among other, job quality, wages, skills levels and task structure. Cooperation between the two institutions was announced with the aim to extend the focus of the skills forecast to include the European job monitor. Such analysis will strengthen Europe’s capacity to better anticipate the future evolution of work and its content. Outcomes of this collaboration will be a joint reference publication and a dissemination event in Brussels in 2018. On the side of this initiative, Eurofound’s FOME project on the future of manufacturing has utilised Cedefop’s skills forecasting framework to produce various scenarios on behalf of DG GROW. At the same time, the workshop provided a forum for validating this exercise through the scrutiny of Cedefop’s group of individual country experts.

7338,CEDEFOP_NEWS_2556,2009-11-29,Financing vocational education and training in the EU new Member States and candidate countries," The Maastricht Communiqu (December 2004) insisted on the need to invest in vocational education and training (VET), particularly with the aim of  focusing on the image and attractiveness of the vocational route, in order to increase participation in VET. Following this approach, the ETF analysed the forms of investment in education and training in several countries, and their impact on the systems. The report has just been published with the title ""Financing vocational education and training in the EU new Member States and candidate countries"" This report provides an overview of the financing of vocational education and training in seven EU new Member States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Cyprus) and four candidate countries (Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and, to a lesser extent, Croatia).

4942,CEDEFOP_NEWS_0167,2020-07-13,Czechia: responses to the Covid-19 outbreak ," Following the declaration of a state of emergency, the physical presence of students in basic, upper secondary and tertiary professional schools was prohibited by the Resolution of the Czech Government of 12 March 2020. The state of emergency was declared for 30 days and subsequently extended until 17 May 2020. From 12 March 2020 until the end of the school year, 30 June 2020, online forms of learning have been used. On its website, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MŠMT) kept updating information on crisis measures and published a schedule for the gradual release of measures and students’ return to school.           On 11 May, schools reopened for final-year students of: basic schools to prepare for their entrance examinations leading to programmes with Maturita exam (VET schools and secondary general schools, Gymnázia); upper secondary schools in programmes leading to a VET certificate or Maturita exam; tertiary professional schools and conservatoires, to prepare for their Absolutorium, and for students in all years of higher education. Consultations and practical training are carried out in person;      On 25 May, schools reopened for the students at primary level of basic schools, to resume their learning, and lower grades of tertiary professional schools to complete their practical training and take exams;    As of 1 June, final examinations, Absolutorium and Maturita exams began. The students in lower grades of upper secondary schools continued with practical training. As of 8 June, the students of secondary level of basic schools and lower grades of upper secondary schools are having class meetings and consultations for the final assessment.        However, students’ full-time participation in school is optional and online learning continues. MŠMT prepared a set of hygiene and safety guidelines: a maximum 15 students per class is allowed and there must be a statutory declaration confirming the absence of symptoms and other risk factors.  Online learning The MŠMT website provided regular updates on recommended procedures for online education/learning. It was supplemented by a signpost indicating where materials for teachers, parents and students were continuously being added, including materials for VET. Online teaching for basic schools was also provided by the public service broadcasters Czech Television and Czech Radio. With the focus on basic and upper secondary schools, Czech Television launched a dedicated portal offering a wide range of documentaries. The Czech Academy of Sciences prepared tips for parents and children on home experiments, e-resources, electronic versions of various journals, online exhibitions and educational videos. For teaching vocational subjects, schools were able to use electronic textbooks or instructional videos created within various projects: such as elecronic texbooks; ejilova, or in cooperation with employers, such as heluz. Access to didactic tests and worksheets for Maturita exams was available to both students and teachers. A version for smartphones and tablets was also provided. The Czech School Inspectorate carried out a comprehensive survey of how teaching was being implemented in all types of schools. Based on the results, the Ministry decided to help one thousand selected schools with technical equipment and the use of communication platforms to secure quality online teaching. There was also an excellent volunteer response from teachers who shared their experience with colleagues via webinars.   Practical training Practical training, which is an integral part of all VET programmes leading to a VET certificate or Maturita exam, and study programmes in tertiary professional schools, was suspended during the ban on in-classroom teaching. Work obligation was announced for students preparing for professions in social services or healthcare; they actively helped while working or participated as volunteers. The MŠMT Decree of 6 May 2020, on education response to the coronavirus epidemic, allowed the headmasters of tertiary professional schools to adjust the accredited curriculum for the summer period. Some companies provided free teaching materials, including the didactic division of FESTO and Scania. In the gastronomy field, usual paid registrations were made available free of charge to those students who were interested in watching training videos from courses for professional educators. Admission to and completion of education programmes Act No. 135/2020 Coll. was adopted, with special rules for admissions to certain types of education and for their completion in the school year 2019/20. It stipulates that final examinations, Maturita exams and Absolutorium may take place no earlier than 21 days after the resumption of in-classroom learning for final-year students; it also cancels the written part of the Maturita exam common component in Czech and foreign languages. Where learning in school cannot take place, a VET or Maturita certificate should be issued based on the students’ learning outcomes from the last three school reports. However, Maturita and final examinations are taking place starting from 1 June 2020.     All students who submitted an application will be admitted to the examination without the obligation to have completed the final year of study. The law stipulates that entrance exams will take place no earlier than 14 days after resumption of in-classroom learning, and there will be only one available date this school year. The content and form of the entrance exams remain unchanged (only the timeframe for completing individual tasks has been added), and there are no changes to the admission criteria set by the headmasters. The implementing regulation in the form of Decree No. 232/2020 Coll., On admission procedure, Maturita exam and final examination in 2019/20, regulates the course and assessment of entrance, Maturita and final examinations and sets the rules for the admission procedures in the school year 2019/20.   Another implementing regulation issued in connection with online learning is Decree No. 211/2020 Coll., On the evaluation of students’ learning outcomes in the second half of 2019/20. This repeals the evaluation rules set out in the school regulations and stipulates that students in the final year of upper secondary schools cannot be assessed with the grade ‘failed’ or ‘not evaluated’ due to the effects of force majeure. Student evaluations should not get worse relative to their usual results.   In May, a series of interactive webinars was prepared to familiarise the schools headmasters with measures releasing the emergency. The webinars provided them with hygiene guidelines for schools and rules for student assessment as well as modified secondary school entrance exams, Maturita exams, Absolutorium and final examinations. Despite varying levels of digital literacy, most teachers showed a proactive attitude in the unprecedented situation. However, differences in standard and quality of education were also evident in terms of infrastructure. The schools vary in terms of technical equipment and not all were able to equip their teachers with laptops. Some students’ families experienced similar difficulties. In 2014, the Digital Literacy Strategy mentioned opening up to new methods and ways of learning through digital technologies as one of its objectives. The coronavirus pandemic has significantly accelerated the gradual use of these methods. It showed that the students from socially disadvantaged backgrounds are particularly vulnerable in terms of connectivity and learning habits. In multiple cities, volunteers and teachers decided to help, copying and distributing learning materials to students in need. Some schools were able to lend tablets to their students to allow them to engage in online learning. Links VET in Europe database - Czechia "

5449,CEDEFOP_NEWS_0668,2018-03-20,Germany: refugees at university ," Education plays a central role in integrating refugees. More than half of the refugees arriving in Germany are younger than 25, an age when education is most needed. Many have gained a university entrance qualification in their home country, or had commenced or completed a degree programme there. With funding from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) has developed a set of targeted measures to enable universities to offer those refugees with sufficient academic qualification access to higher general and higher vocational education.  Approximately EUR 100 million in funding will be available until 2019. Using funding from the BMBF, the DAAD has developed an extensive package of long-term measures comprising three components which form the basis for ensuring access to university study:   component 1: recognising skills and qualifications: refugees who are potentially qualified for university study arrive with a wide range of language skills and abilities. Precisely determining what these abilities are, whether they qualify them for study and where support is needed, supports integration into regular degree programmes and contributes to academic success. This is achieved through an initial advising session, diagnostic testing procedures and the assessment of certificates of academic qualification (TestAS, uni-assist and onSET for refugees); component 2: ensuring academic qualification through language and subject-related preparation: the funding programme Integrating refugees in degree programmes (Integra) prepares young foreigners without a university entrance qualification for the rigours of university study by offering relevant programmes at preparatory colleges (Studienkollegs), foundation courses and at German universities. Participants learn fundamental subject-specific knowledge and terminology, and develop individual learning strategies and social skills. The German federal government has agreed to finance some 2 400 additional places at preparatory colleges and comparable university programmes in the next few years. The universities themselves are preparing refugees for admission to their degree programmes with supplementary language and preparatory courses; component 3: supporting integration at universities: through the funding programme Welcome - students helping refugees, many students are volunteering their time to assist refugees to integrate in German universities. Their efforts are contributing to the refugees’ academic success and social integration. These measures include buddy and mentoring programmes at several universities, as well as language learning projects headed by teacher trainees and students of German language studies. Such projects are funded by the Federal Government, recognising the important contribution the students are making. The programme’s funding supports students and their projects at universities by offering them employment contracts and covering the cost of materials.

5450,CEDEFOP_NEWS_0663,2018-03-20,Netherlands: public-private partnerships will promote innovation in VET," The Social and Economic Council of the Netherlands (SER) has published a report on VET, which emphasises the importance of intensifying cooperation between schools and enterprises. The aim is to be responsive to, and able to keep up with, the pace of innovation. To keep up with innovation and continuously changing job requirements, the government and private sector have joined forces to accelerate change and invest in adjusting workforce skills. Dynamic regional and sectoral partnerships were formed: centres of expertise (in higher education) and centres for innovative craftsmanship (in vocational education). The centres promote collaboration between local business, vocational schools, institutes for higher education and the government. Shared investments of both public and private parties help drive business models that create financial viability. Variation and autonomy are key characteristics. Each centre creates its own niche and market value. Through associations with education organisations, new insights, methods and curricula reach an extended audience. The focus of the centres lies in: building strong ties between VET schools and businesses; training of professionals, craftspersons in innovative skills; providing lifelong learning and just-in-time retraining facilities; accelerating and improving companies’ capacity for innovation. Katapult – the title of the community of all 160 centres - intends to increase outreach and sustainability and to explore and launch strategies to involve more regional stakeholders in the centres’ activities. An overview of the policies and financing of the centres was published at the so-called Katapult-day, on 30 November 2017. In two years’ time the number of companies cooperating with a centre has doubled, from 3 000 to 6 000. Also, 50 000 students are currently participating in the activities of local centres. The aims of the Katapult community for 2025 are: 90% of all Dutch schools for senior vocational education, as well as of the Universities of Applied Sciences, participating a centre’s activities; achieve the involvement of 25% of all VET students; expand business involvement in the centres’ activities up to 20 000 companies; increase teacher involvement in centres’ activities to create up-to-date curricula. On Katapult-day, Mr. Hans de Jong, CEO of Philips Benelux, emphasised the importance of the centres and urged companies to get involved in their activities: ‘Only if many more companies are willing to cooperate with schools for vocational education, are we able to train new talents for the innovation of the labour market and innovation society as a whole.

5269,CEDEFOP_NEWS_0485,2018-12-13,Iceland: more funds for VET in the 2019 State budget," The State budget proposal for 2019, submitted to the Icelandic Parliament on 11 September, included several measures concerning VET-related issues, including a possible budget increase that would improve the potential of the ‘workplace training fund’ (Vinnustaðanámssjóður). However, the proposed budget increase for VET is subject to the outcome of a pending report on the efficiency of the current funding framework. Currently, the workplace training fund serves as the main source of financial support to companies willing to take on VET students. Companies get compensation from the fund for a specific training period to meet training costs. Many companies/employers have called for an increase in overall funding for the workplace training fund, or alternatively for a restructuring of the way funds are allocated. Another important VET-related measure is also included in the draft budget: the creation of a ‘workplace VET logbook’ (IS: Ferilbók). This logbook is intended to serve as an electronic database where the work-based component of VET education will be registered. The database will also contain all intended learning outcomes expected from the learner at the workplace. The master in trade overseeing work-based learning will have access to the database, ensuring that the student accomplishes the predefined learning outcomes. The master, the student and the VET school should agree on a detailed learning contract at the beginning of the learning period. Even though the technical details and specifications of the workplace VET logbook are not finalised yet, the practice itself is thought of as a step that may significantly improve VET provision in Iceland.

To avoid any misinterpretation of the results, users of the calculations are kindly invited to review the FIRDS Transparency System downloading instructions document in particular paragraph 28. As communicated on 9 April 2020, the annual transparency calculations for the other non-equity instruments have been postponed. Next steps The transparency requirements based on the results of the annual calculations of the large in scale (LIS) and size specific to the instruments (SSTI) thresholds for bonds shall apply from 1 June 2020 until 31 May 2021. From 1 June 2021, the results of the next annual calculations of the LIS and SSTI thresholds for bonds, to be published by 30 April 2021, will become applicable. Systematic internaliser calculations for equity, equity-like instruments and bonds ESMA has published data for the systematic internaliser calculations for equity, equity-like instruments and bonds under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and Regulation (MiFIR). ESMA has published the total number of trades and total volume over the period October 2019-March 2020 for the purpose of the systematic internaliser (SI) calculations for 24,940 equity and equity-like instruments and for 316,894 bonds. The results are published only for instruments for which trading venues submitted data for at least 95% of all trading days over the 6-month observation period. The data publications also incorporate OTC trading to the extent it has been reported to ESMA. The publication includes data also for instruments which are no longer available for trading on EU trading venues at the end of December. The publication of the data for the SI calculations for derivatives and other instruments has been delayed until August 2020, as announced on 9 April. The SI-assessment for those asset classes does not need to be performed until September 2020. New bond liquidity data available ESMA has started today to make available the latest quarterly liquidity assessment for bonds available for trading on EU trading venues. For this period, there are currently 745 liquid bonds subject to MiFID II transparency requirements. ESMA’s liquidity assessment for bonds is based on a quarterly assessment of quantitative liquidity criteria, which include the daily average trading activity (trades and notional amount) and percentage of days traded per quarter. ESMA updates the bond market liquidity assessments quarterly. However, additional data and corrections submitted to ESMA may result in further updates within each quarter, published in ESMA’s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS), which shall be applicable the day following publication.  The scope of assessed bonds decreased for this publication as a result of a change in reporting practice from a trading venue in the United Kingdom. This change does not affect the quality of the calculations on the bonds that are published The full list of assessed bonds will be available through FITRS in the XML files with publication date from 30 April 2020 (link available here) and through the Register web interface (link available here).

29148,ESMA_PR_0748,2017-11-13,ESMA highlights ICO risks for investors and firms," Investors ESMA is alerting investors of the high risk of losing all of their invested capital as ICOs are very risky and highly speculative investments. The price of the coin or token is typically extremely volatile and investors may not be able to redeem them for a prolonged period. Another key risk stems from the fact that, depending on how they are structured, ICOs may fall outside of the scope of EU laws and regulations, in which case investors cannot benefit from the protection that these laws and regulations provide. ICOs are also vulnerable to the risk of fraud or money laundering. Firms Where ICOs qualify as financial instruments, it is likely that firms involved in ICOs conduct regulated investment activities, in which case they need to comply with the relevant legislation, including for example: ·         the Prospectus Directive, ·         the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), ·         the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD); and ·         the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. ESMA stresses that firms involved in ICOs should give careful consideration as to whether their activities constitute regulated activities. Any failure to comply with the applicable rules will constitute a breach. Background An ICO is an innovative way of raising money from the public, using so-called coins or tokens and can also be called an initial token offering or token sale. In an ICO, a business or individual issues coins or tokens and puts them for sale in exchange for fiat currencies, such as the Euro, or more often virtual currencies, e.g. Bitcoin or Ether. The features and purpose of the coins or tokens vary across ICOs: ·         Some coins or tokens serve to access or purchase a service or product that the issuer develops using the proceeds of the ICO; ·         Others provide voting rights or a share in the future revenues of the issuing venture; ·         Some have no tangible value; and ·         Some coins or tokens are traded and/or may be exchanged into fiat or virtual currencies at specialised coin exchanges after issuance.   ICOs are used to raise funds for a variety of projects, including but not limited to businesses leveraging on the Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology."
28471,ESMA_PR_0041,2020-03-20,ESMA sets out approach on MiFIR tick-size regime for Systematic Internalisers," ESMA expects competent authorities not to prioritise their supervisory actions in relation to the new tick-size regime from 26 March, the application date, until 26 June 2020, and to generally apply their risk-based supervisory powers in their day-to-day enforcement of applicable legislation in this area in a proportionate manner. ESMA, in coordination with national competent authorities, continues to monitor developments in financial markets as a result of the COVID-19, including the application of relevant EU requirements by market participants, and is prepared to use its powers to ensure financial stability, orderly functioning of EU markets and investor protection."
27785,ESMA_NEWS_0890,2018-10-15,ESMA sees 1.9% increase in prospectus approvals across the EEA ," In line with 2016, in 2017 around 40% (1421 out of 3567) of the prospectuses approved were in the form of base prospectuses and 91% were drawn up as single documents as opposed to tripartite prospectuses. Almost 74% (2626) of prospectuses approved in 2017 related to non-equity securities with the most frequent security type being debt securities with a denomination of at least €100.000. After three years of decrease, the number of EEA prospectuses passported to one or more host countries increased by around 2.6% from 2016 to 2017 (from 838 to 860), with Germany and Luxembourg still accounting for the majority of prospectuses passported to other EEA countries in 2017. The purpose of making prospectus data available is to provide information about trends within the prospectus regime in terms of general approval and passporting activity, as well as the structure of approved prospectuses and the types of securities they cover. ESMA has published reports on prospectus activity since 2007, and data reports published between 2011 and 2016 are available on ESMA’s website. Furthermore, the website provides access to ESMA’s Prospectus Register where stakeholders can search for additional detailed information in relation to prospectuses approved and passported within the EEA."

28012,ESMA_NEWS_1125,2017-12-05,ESMA latest Risk Dashboard sees no change in overall risk levels," In Q3 2017, EU financial markets remained relatively calm, although reactive to global geopolitical events. This was reflected in increased market expectations of the near-term volatility following global political tensions. While market and credit risks remain very high, ESMA's outlook for credit risk has declined reflecting improvements in risk indicators. The outlook for liquidity and contagion risk is stable. While operational risk continues to be elevated, with a worsening outlook due mounting concerns over potential for cyber-attacks.  "
29106,ESMA_NEWS_0705,2017-12-20,ESMA PUBLISHES CRA MARKET SHARE CALCULATION," The purpose of the market share calculation is to facilitate issuers and related third parties in their evaluation of a CRA with no more than 10% total market share in the EU. The CRA Regulation (CRAR), under Article 8d, says that issuers or related third parties are required to consider appointing a CRA with no more than 10% total market share whenever they intend to appoint one or more CRAs to rate an issuance or entity. Using the Market Share Calculation The publication aims to guide the user through the requirements of Article 8d. It also provides background and guidance as to how the market share calculation is performed and should be used. The structure and approach of the document is as follows: Section 6 - Allows the user to identify CRAs with no more than 10% total market share; Section 7 - Allows the user to identify the types of credit ratings offered by these CRAs; Section 8 - Allows the user to assess the proportion each credit rating type makes up of a CRA’s overall issuance; and Section 9 - Provides a link to a Standard Form and Supervisory Briefing the user can for documenting the non-appointment of a CRA with no more than 10% total market share. This market share calculation is valid for use from its date of publication and applicable until the date of publication of the next Market Share Calculation in 2018. ESMA welcomes feedback on the information presented in this market share calculation in future and invites market participants to send this by email to: CRA-info@esma.europa.eu"

27305,ESMA_NEWS_0388,2020-05-20,ESMA calls for transparency on COVID-19 effects in half-yearly financial reports," The Public Statement provides recommendations on areas of focus identified by ESMA and highlights: -        the importance of providing relevant and reliable information, which may require issuers to make use of the time allowed by national law to publish half-yearly financial reports while not unduly delaying the timing of publication; -        the importance of updating the information included in the latest annual accounts to adequately inform stakeholders of the impacts of COVID-19, in particular in relation to significant uncertainties and risks, going concern, impairment of non-financial assets and presentation in the statement of profit or loss; and -        the need for entity-specific information on the past and expected future impact of COVID-19 on the strategic orientation and targets, operations, performance of issuers as well as any mitigating actions put in place to address the effects of the pandemic. The Public Statement is also applicable to financial statements in other interim periods when IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting is applied. It calls on the management, administrative and supervisory bodies, including audit committees, of issuers and, where applicable, their auditors, to take due consideration of the recommendations included within the statement. ESMA further emphasises the role of audit committees in promoting high-quality half-yearly financial reports at this difficult junction in time. Next steps ESMA and European national enforcers will monitor and supervise the application of the IFRS requirements as well as any other relevant provisions outlined in the Statement, with national authorities incorporating them into their examinations and taking corrective actions where appropriate. ESMA will collect data on how EU listed entities have applied the recommendations and will take into account those findings, amongst other considerations, in setting the enforcement priorities for the annual financial statements for the year 2020. These findings will be reported on in ESMA’s Report on the 2020 enforcement activities."

The Report provides an overview of the applicable legal framework and the sanctions and measures imposed by NCAs under the MiFID II framework during the year 2019. Due to differences in the identification of sanctions and measures for the purpose of the reporting to ESMA and the length of the enforcement processes, the data does not provide at this time the basis for detailed statistics, clear trends or tendencies in the imposition of sanctions and measures. Next Steps The information included in this Report will contribute to ESMA’s work aimed at fostering supervisory convergence in the application of MiFID II."
28095,ESMA_PR_1210,2017-07-13,ESMA consults on certain aspects of the MiFID II suitability requirements," The suitability requirements were introduced under MiFID to enhance investor protection by ensuring that firms which provide investment advice and portfolio management act in the clients’ best interests. Suitability has to be assessed against clients’ knowledge and experience, financial situation and investment objectives. In order to achieve this, investment firms have to obtain the necessary information from clients. While the objectives of the suitability assessment under MiFID I remain unchanged under MiFID II, the obligations have been strengthened and specified further under the new legislative framework by including the following requirements: an explicit reference to the fact that the use of electronic systems shall not reduce the responsibility of firms; further details on conduct rules for firms providing a periodic assessment of the suitability; the requirement for firms performing a suitability assessment to assess, taking into account costs and complexity, whether equivalent products can meet client’s needs; the requirement for firms to analyse the costs and benefits of switching from one investment to another one; the extension of suitability requirements to structured deposits; and the requirement for firms to provide clients with a suitability report prior to the conclusion of the recommended transaction. Proposed Guidelines on certain aspects of the MiFID II suitability requirements The Consultation Paper includes proposals on the draft guidelines which confirm and broaden the existing guidelines, issued in 2012, in order to: consider recent technological developments of the advisory market, including the increasing use of robo-advice, i.e. automated or semi-automated systems for the provision of investment advice or portfolio management; give relevance to the results of supervisory activities conducted by national competent authorities (NCAs) on the suitability requirements; incorporate some insights of studies in the area of behavioural finance; and provide additional details on some aspects that were already covered under the ESMA’s 2012 guidelines. Next Steps The consultation closes on 13 October 2017. ESMA will consider the feedback it receives to the consultation in Q4 2017/Q1 2018 and expects to publish a final report in Q1/Q2 2018.                  "

28199,ESMA_NEWS_1328,2017-02-03,ESMA publishes Practical Guide to national rules across EEA on major holdings notifications under Transparency Directive," The Transparency Directive requires investors to notify issuers when they acquire or dispose of shares admitted to trading on regulated markets, resulting in their total voting rights crossing certain set thresholds. As a minimum harmonisation directive, the Transparency Directive allows EEA countries some discretion as to how they transpose the rules into national law. Therefore, ESMA has prepared this Practical Guide, in close cooperation with national regulators, to help market participants identify their notification obligations under national law in accordance with the Transparency Directive. The first part of the Practical Guide contains a fact sheet for each EEA country (with the exception of Lichtenstein) setting out the national requirements in relation to notification of major holdings along with links to the relevant websites. The second part presents information on rules and practices in a series of tables, enabling market participants to compare rules across different jurisdictions. ESMA has created the Practical Guide based on information provided by national regulators and market participants should address any queries regarding specific content directly to the relevant regulator of the country concerned. ESMA will update the Practical Guide on an ad hoc basis, based on changes to national rules and practices. "

29338,ESMA_NEWS_0955,2016-12-21,ESMA proposes new digital format for issuers’ financial reporting," The digital format will allow users such as investors, analysts and auditors to carry out software supported analysis and comparison of large amounts of financial information. Access to annual financial reports for both professional and retail investors is essential for creating robust capital markets across the EU. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said “Financial reports are crucial for a full understanding of a company’s situation and moving to electronic reporting will facilitate analysis, comparability and accessibility of issuers’ financial statements. ""We believe that the vast pool of free, structured financial information that will emerge once electronic reporting starts will trigger technological innovation. The Inline XBRL format has the potential to bring financial reporting into the digital age.” The main conclusions in ESMA’s statement are: Issuers must prepare their annual financial reports in the human readable XHTML (Extensible Hyper Text Markup Language) format, which can be read by standard browsers without the need for specialised tools; Only where annual financial reports contain IFRS consolidated financial statements must issuers label this information using XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language), which is machine-readable. The XBRL data is embedded directly into the XHTML document through the Inline XBRL format. ESMA may extend mandatory labelling of information using XBRL to other parts of the annual financial report or to financial statements prepared under third country GAAP at a later stage; and The IFRS Foundation’s Taxonomy should be used to transfer financial information into structured data for the electronic reporting of IFRS financial statements. ESMA will focus on developing the detailed technical rules, field test its proposed solution and afterwards submit the technical standard to the European Commission for endorsement around year-end 2017."

This opinion outlines the assessment of the liquidity risk posed by liquidity providers regardless whether or not these being a clearing member. ESMA clarifies that CCPs should include, in the measurement of their liquidity needs, the default of their top two clearing members in all their capacities vis-à-vis the CCP, in addition to assessing in their stress testing scenarios all entities towards which the CCP has a liquidity exposure. ESMA’s opinion is addressed to competent authorities responsible for CCP supervision."
28919,ESMA_NEWS_0511,2018-09-26,ESMA updates Q&A on MiFIR data reporting," The updated Q&As document includes the following two new Q&As: FX Swaps reporting: the Q&A includes reference data and transaction reporting scenarios where an FX swap is reported as a single stand-alone financial instrument. This specific Q&A should be implemented in 6 months after its publication. To ensure a consistent approach across reporting requirements, ESMA is also publishing today a Q&A on FX swap reporting under EMIR, which is expected to be implemented 12 months after its publication due to the higher operational complexities, related to the reporting of post-trade events and UTI exchange. Interest Rate Swaps reporting: the Q&A includes reference data and transaction reporting scenarios involving Interest Rate Swaps. Given its impact on the ISIN creation process, this Q&A is envisaged to apply 6 months after the publication date. Issuance of new ISINs as per the Q&A is only expected for the new instruments that must be reported to FIRDS for the first time on implementation date and going forward. The ISINs reported under the requirements of Article 27 of MiFIR that were issued prior to the implementation date of this Q&A and are still live on the implementation date should not be terminated in FIRDS. Reference data Fields 8-11: the Q&A clarifies how trading venues or SIs should populate Fields 8-11 in the reports submitted under Article 4 MAR and Article 27 MiFIR. The updated Q&A also include an amendment to the existing Q&A 1 on Total issued nominal amount (MiFIR Q&A Section 11. Field 14 and Field 17). The purpose of these Q&As is to promote common supervisory approaches and practices in the application of MiFIR.

27233,ESMA_NEWS_0316,2020-08-31,ESMA publishes list of thresholds for shareholder identification," The document contains information provided by national competent authorities setting out: national thresholds for shareholder identification in Member States that have established such a threshold; relevant national legislation and rules; and indication of Member States where the revised Shareholder Rights Directive (SRDII) has not yet been transposed into national law. ESMA drafted this document to enhance transparency around the regimes adopted across the EU. The revised SRDII requires Member States to ensure that companies have the right to identify their shareholders. Member States may provide for companies having a registered office on their territory to be only allowed to request the identification of shareholders holding more than a certain percentage of shares or voting rights. Such a percentage shall not exceed 0,5 %. Next steps When ESMA receives notifications from Member States that information reflected in the document has changed, the document will be updated and republished on the website. However, there may be a small delay in making such updates. If any discrepancy is identified between the information in the document and legislation or rules published at national level, priority should therefore be given to the latter."

15716,SRB_NEWS_0049,2017-12-12,"Single Resolution Board holds its second conference in Brussels  ""Building resolvability together""","  Brussels – 29 September 2017 Today, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) is holding its second conference in Brussels under the theme ""Building resolvability together”. The SRB’s focus is on making banks easier to resolve, counting on and fostering a strong cooperation with all its stakeholders. Since the financial crisis much has happened: banks are stronger, safer and less leveraged today. But more progress still remains to be made by banks, enhancing their preparedness for resolution, and by the authorities developing and enhancing Resolution Plans, setting minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) and more generally addressing barriers to resolution. This work will require seamless cooperation across all stakeholders. “The Single Resolution Board, together with the National Resolution Authorities of the Banking Union, focuses on resolution planning and preparation with a forward-looking mindset to avoid the potential negative impact of a bank failure on the economy and on financial stability. 2017 has seen the first experience with the resolution framework. It clearly proved its functioning, but work on resolvability is a multi-year project for all and the lessons-learned will feed into future work.” - Elke König, Chair of the Single Resolution BoardThe conference features opening addresses and keynotes from:Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for the Euro and Social Dialogue, also in charge of Financial Stability, Financial Services and the Capital Markets Union, speaking on the future of resolution and the Banking Union : ""We created the Single Resolution Mechanism as the second pillar of the Banking Union in the midst of crisis with ambitious aims: reducing the bank-sovereign feedback loop, protecting financial stability, and making sure that taxpayers are not first in line to foot the bill for the banking sector's mistakes. This year - as it was put to the test – we saw that the SRM is working. But work still remains before we have fully achieved its objectives. We need to implement what we have agreed, further reduce risks in the banking system, and complete the Banking Union. This is one of the most important short-term actions if we want to move on with the deepening of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union.""Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank, speaking on the need for a safety net: “We need to tackle the issue of funding in resolution. New instruments may be needed”. Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, Bank of England, speaking on resolution feasibility: “There are in place now credible options, other than insolvency or bailout, that ensure that bank shareholders and creditors will bear losses if a bank fails”.Martin J. Gruenberg, Chairman, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, speaking on building resolvability for globally systemic important banks: “Tackling the issue of resolving a systemically important financial institution requires the commitment of all of the groups represented here today on a global scale. Together, we are building a solid foundation to address this critically important issue.  More work remains to be done, but we shouldn’t lose sight of how far we have come.” The Conference also features panel discussions with the industry, regulators and supervisors focused on the promises of the Banking Union, the future of resolution and international challenges to overcome.  The conclusions of the Single Resolution Board's second conference will be available as a report to be published in the course of next month.To follow the event through web-stream, download the agenda, or learn more, go to the conference homepage.

15737,SRB_NEWS_0002,2020-07-10,Brexit: get ready for changes,"Over the past few months, there has been an understandable focus on dealing with the effects of the Covid-19 outbreak on our economies. However, we should not forget some of the other challenges facing the European financial sector, among them the fact that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union at the end of the year.Yesterday, the European Commission published its Brexit readiness communication, calling on banks, investment firms and other financial sector actors to consider how this will affect their business and to take all the necessary steps to prepare.The SRB is monitoring the situation closely with the European Central Bank, the European Commission and other financial stability partners. We also work closely with the Bank of England, and look forward to continuing our fruitful cooperation.The SRB has been working with the banks under its remit to prepare for this scenario for some time, and published its Brexit expectations document in November 2018. This document covers MREL eligibility, internal loss absorbency, operational continuity, access to FMIs and other matters. We communicated our expectations on an individual basis to banks. The SRB put a particular emphasis on issuances under UK law, raising awareness that they may become non-eligible for MREL.The SRB’s Expectations for Banks document and the recently published MREL policy under the Banking Package also lay out measures applying to third countries, which will apply to the UK from 1 January 2021. This includes adding relevant clauses to contracts governed by third country law to ensure eligibility for MREL, enhance cross-border recognition of resolution actions or support operational continuity in resolution.As previously stated, the 2020 resolution planning cycle will take the impact of Brexit and the end of the transition period into account while continuing to make progress towards all banks being resolvable. What is clear is that there has been a significant lead-in time for Brexit and the SRB has been transparent on what we expect from banks. The time of uncertainty is now over. Banks should use the remaining time to be fully prepared."
12858,EIT_NEWS_0827,2018-11-20,EIT InnoEnergy MSc Alumni's company expands internationally," The company aims to improve the lives of those without reliable access to energy   With a smart concept of a lamp that can be assembled by anyone anywhere, EIT InnoEnergy MSc SELECT alumni Govinda Upadhyay's company, LEDsafari, has been expanding internationally and has now reached 40 countries. Govinda won the 2015 EIT CHANGE Award for his design of a simple and affordable solar LED lamp, after completing the EIT InnoEnergy MSc programme in 2012. The idea then became a start-up when he founded his own ed-tech company, LEDsafari, in 2016.    A true believer in the importance of networking, Govinda shared how he was able to get the idea off the ground in the first place. 'The EIT InnoEnergy programme and network is what really helped me develop my idea and turn it into a business. And I’m still tapping into this network – and always will. Excellent contacts and support are vital to succeed in business.' And now the multi-award winner (including Forbes 30Under30, Asia21 Young leaders, BITSAA’s 30 under 30, and the recent Prestigious Ambassador Award from the Swiss government) shares what’s new with this growing company. New products 'LEDsafari is evolving fast' Govinda explained. 'We are moving towards online training for staff of solar companies working in emerging economies. We realised that we need more trained people in the solar sector, especially in emerging economies. And this is how we can fill that gap.'  With an upgraded online training platform that offers new courses for solar companies and organisations to train their staff, LEDsafari is doing their part to help the planet go solar. 'Also new, our plug and play IoT sensor technology that makes it easy to do remote monitoring of solar devices. It is reliable, works with the 2G network (so no need for internet), and predicts possible faults in the solar panel. This will create efficiency in solar operations and hopefully bring more jobs and growth to the solar sector.'  Govinda shows a perfect example of these two technologies working together with their new SmartHelio products launched at InterSolar Munich and Brazil – with many companies showing interest in this B2B platform. 'Using online training and sensors, we will manage solar companies’ staff and solar devices. Our goal is to become the gold standard for training on these skills.' He added, 'It is essential to go to conferences and exhibitions. That’s why we are travelling all over the world to promote this simple and powerful new technology.' Community Outreach Always thinking on how to improve the lives of those without reliable access to energy (and teaching sustainability principles to those WITH reliable access), LEDsafari has continuously worked towards enabling communities to create their own healthy light source – which was the very goal of his original project-turned-business-idea. 'We have developed an innovative pedagogical way to teach students about electrical concepts, design process and sustainability using the process of making a simple and inexpensive solar LED lamp. We now have over ten different types of simple DIY solar kits for the schools and children.' LEDsafari has expanded its outreach program to 40 countries now, with new partners in Bali (Indonesia), Leh (India), Haiti, Ghana and Guatemala.

13341,EIT_NEWS_1310,2017-02-22,Irene's story: EIT Digital Master School," Meet former EIT Digital Master School program student, Irene Kolomvrezou. Have you ever thought of yourself as a student traveller? Well, certainly, Irene did, even before she discovered the EIT Digital Master School Programme back in 2013. This young Greek student in Mathematics and IT was looking for an international qualification, when finishing her Bachelor's programme from the University of Athens, and she came across the EIT Digital Master School programme. ""I started mathematics and wanted to continue in new technology studies so [tweetable]EIT Digital was a perfect match to broaden my horizons[/tweetable]. The EIT Digital Master School had the full package and at the time, it was a new programme."" Irene started the Master programme in Human Computer Interaction and Design at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. She enjoyed experiencing new ways of teaching and learning in Sweden as well as discovering the city and making new friends from all over Europe. In combination with her second year at Aalto University in Finland, KTH gave her solid basis in business development on top of her computer and maths researches. ""I enjoyed networking with EIT Digital people to gather all diverse experiences from universities, with a common background in our studies but different point of views. By starting studying in two different countries, I managed to get new perspectives. This has been a great personal experience, I learned a lot about myself."" Little did Irene know that she would end up joining a booming startup after her studies: ""Before joining the EIT Digital Master School Programme, the world of startups was far away from me. The reason I wanted to learn more about business is because I felt I was missing a lot of key knowledge."" During the Summer School, which is mandatory between the first and second year of the EIT Digital Master School, Irene created a network that helped her find a master thesis, continuing her researches in Digital Wellbeing. The EIT Digital Co-location Centre in Eindhoven had a High Impact Initiative at the time called 'Fit to Perform' and needed new people to join. Irene was employed by Philips, partner of EIT Digital and came to Eindhoven to work on developing a wearable device that measures truck drivers' vigilance by processing their physiological data. The startup is about to launch its services this year in July. Irene's advice to students: ""Move around. Broaden your horizons."" ""Too often, students in Greece have doubts about going abroad. It is good to discover Europe's different cultures and I encourage people to do so: go abroad for a short period, learn new languages, make new friends, it doesn't mean you won't be back. The EIT Digital Master School programmes opens a lot of doors, many opportunities, networking and getting to know what is out there. I was missing this in Greece. I was missing the big picture. EIT Digital encourages collaboration and team spirit both at University and at Node level."" If you are looking to know more about EIT Digital Master School,  you can meet EIT Digital during their European Master School roadshow: MASTER SCHOOL ROADSHOW The Master School is a two-year master's programme with eight technical Majors and a Minor in Innovation & Entrepreneurship. 18 European top universities, renowned researchers and leading businesses are in partnership with EIT Digital to provide cutting-edge ICT excellence in combination with innovation and entrepreneurship training, leading to a double degree and an EIT-labelled Certificate.

13273,EIT_NEWS_1242,2017-05-19,EIT Digital PhD graduate has 'sixth sense' for innovation," Birds, turtles and other animals like fish have a sense that human beings lack: a sense of orientation. Now, Dr Julia Wache, a 2017 graduate of the EIT Digital Doctoral School, has co-founded feelSpace, a company that produces a vibrotactile compass belt that functions as a sixth sense. It helps visually impaired people to orientate themselves and find their way. Thanks to a recent cash injection, the company has increased production and has also come up with a game. Wache and her co-founders are getting ready to take their sixth sense across Europe. Giving people an extra orientation sense like the one animals have, sounds like a synopsis for a movie or a philosophical question. But ten years ago, researchers at Osnabruck University started to research this question. They found that in addition to the known human senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, with a bit of help, human beings could also learn to use a sense of orientation. Sixth sense belt For research purposes, they developed a tactile compass belt. The waist is, says Wache, is the most convenient and reliable place to wear such a device. 'The neck would be uncomfortable and arms or legs move too much.' The belt has integrated vibration elements, equally spaced around the waist. The northernmost element is active constantly. If the user turns, the signal moves around the waist. The belt bearers are therefore always aware of where north is and their position in relation to it. Research, including behavioural and physiological tests with participants, revealed that the belt was especially helpful to blind subjects who can navigate more intuitively with the belt. 'People who tried the belt really liked it', says Wache. 'Even those who were not visually impaired. Some of them said 'this is so awesome, where can I buy it?' At that time, the belt was not meant to be a commercial product. The first version even looked scary, you wouldn't want to enter an airport with it.' EIT Digital Doctoral School So how did Wache, who always thought she would become a scientist, come to be involved in a new startup? First, she knew the researchers, in fact one of them was her twin sister, and her sister's research intrigued her. She visited her in Trento University where her sister worked on an exchange programme. Here, Wache heard about the EIT Digital Doctoral School. Somehow, the school awakened a latent ambition in her. 'I have always had the feeling that I wanted to implement something myself and improve people's lives with it.'  She applied and got admitted to the ICT Doctoral Programme at the University of Trento, a partner of the EIT Digital Doctoral School. Founding feelSpace At the EIT Digital Doctoral School, Wache learned to think like an entrepreneur and to act like one; it turned into a state of being. Her studies in innovation and entrepreneurship at the EIT Digital Doctoral School alongside her interest in her sister's research, led her to ask the questions: Why not turn this significant research into a business? One that can provide blind or visually impaired people with a sixth sense that makes their lives easier? Why not produce and sell the belts? Why not found a startup? And so, she did. In 2014, Wache designed a business model for her Business Development Experience. The model centred around a startup selling tactile navigation belts that will help blind people navigate and orientate better. The idea was approved by EIT Digital and supported by information from the researchers at University of Osnabrück. She - and her fellow students , came top of the class which allowed them to attend the VT KnowledgeWorks Global Student Entrepreneurship Challenge in Virginia in the US, where they won a $25,000 prize. Wache's business model and the acknowledgement of winning the contest validated her concept and finally led to the founding of the feelSpace company in November 2015. Investor feelSpace, based in Osnabrück, benefited from German financial aid designed to support spinoffs of universities. The aid covered the salaries of three people for one year. Following this, Wache helped to design and drive a crowdfunding campaign at Indiegogo which raised over $13,000. Additionally, to secure long-term company development, the founders set about trying to find an investor. Here, she really could practice what she was taught in the ""Growth and Harvest"" course at the EIT Digital Doctoral School. 'When we were looking for and talking with investors, I could separate the good offers from the bad. I could sense we could aim for higher figures.' In February 2017, the founders succeeded in securing a €600,000 investment from Johannes Busmann of Prowind GmbH. Producing the sixth sense belt With this funding, Wache and her co-founders were able to speed up development and started producing the belt in bigger volumes to enter the market. The initial market penetration focused on institutions for visually impaired people. Wache says with pride that they already have their first paying and happy customers. 'This means there is a need for our product among visually impaired people.' One blind user has said to Wache that she can now go horse-riding and be conscious of where she is, even though she cannot see. And she knows she can find her way back. 'The tactile belt gives people freedom, independence and more self-confidence. They can go out, feel free and decide for themselves when and where to go and can be certain to find their way back home on their own.' Using the corresponding smartphone app - connected via Bluetooth - you can enter details of any address you want to get to. Of course, visually impaired people can rely on traditional navigation apps as well, but this usually means listening to a voice on their device. That forces them to focus their hearing on the navigation aids - a sense they'd rather use to focus on traffic and other noises in their surroundings. With the feelSpace navigation belt they are more or less equipped with an extra sense; they can navigate without overloading their other senses. The belt makes life much easier for those who cannot see well or cannot see at all.' Target Audience Although the primary target audience is visually impaired people, customers with other impairments, like deaf people, or with no impairments at all, can also benefit from this extra sense. Wache says: 'Sighted people like to use it to further their ability to orientate and navigate more easily and to fully use their other senses so they have a fuller experience of their surroundings. That makes me proud. The sixth sense is complementary to their other working senses.' That is why feelSpace also promotes the belt as an orientation and navigation device to sighted people. 'Hikers, bikers or tourists do not want to constantly stare at their smartphones for navigation help while exploring, or be frustrated by excessive sunlight or rain, rendering smartphone displays difficult to read.' For sale Using a sixth sense is no longer a fantasy; it is for sale at feelSpace. The belt is a reality and the opportunity to live with a sixth sense has been made possible by Wache and her colleagues. As far as they know, theirs is the first company to come to the market with an extra sense that is comfortable to wear. Accordingly, Wache has high hopes for the commercial success of the tactile compass belt. 'We are en route to making some money.' Future feelSpace has big plans for the coming year as it continues its development. An important milestone will be launching the iPhone version of the app that accompanies the belt. So far, there has only been an Android app. Also, improvements are in development to further the social inclusion of blind and visually impaired people, particularly into working life, like a voice input for the navigation app. The company's first target market is Germany. 'In Germany, we are well connected with the market for visually impaired tools, many institutions for blind people know us already.' The European market is the next step, to be tackled in 2018. Game In May, feelSpace introduced a new product, called 'feelSpace - The Game'. Here, the tactile belts can be used for teambuilding, and social events in schools or at business events. 'This game is about learning to trust one another,' explains Wache. One person who controls the app, navigates their blindfolded, belt wearing partner through a labyrinth. The belt wearer feels vibrations either on the left, back, middle or right side of his or her waist to lead the direction. The Game will be officially launched in the coming weeks and it targets a new sector for feelSpace, says Wache, who is now a fully European entrepreneur - heart and soul.

12509,EIT_NEWS_0478,2020-01-14,Innovative battery start-up joins EIT InnoEnergy," The innovative battery start-up, AC Biode, has joined EIT InnoEnergy. AC Biode is developing the world’s first standalone alternating current battery using a so-called  ‘biode’, which has both the characteristics of an anode and a cathode. The alternating current battery is more efficient, safer and about 30 per cent more compact than regular batteries, which use direct current (DC). We are going to use existing materials and production lines but switch from direct current to alternating current. All the batteries in the world are direct current. At the moment when you charge a battery, the power source comes from alternating current and the battery is direct current. The majority of motors, such as in electric cars or drones, are alternating currents. So you lose up to 35 per cent of electricity. We can reduce the loss. Tadashi Kubo, CEO and co-founder   "
13292,EIT_NEWS_1261,2017-04-26,EIT Director spoke at Webit Festival Europe," Martin Kern, the Interim Director of the EIT, spoke today at the Webit Festival Europe.  In a talk with Plamen Russev, Founder & Chairman of the Webit Foundation, Martin Kern discussed the many successes the EIT and its Innovation Communities have achieved thus far, pointing to specific examples such as Konux, Plume Labs, Furhat Robotics and Tado. Mr Kern also pointed to the practical help that start-ups receive. A constant issue for these ventures is funding, so the EIT provides (in addition to some funding) training on how to pitch to potential investors and clients. As Mr Kern explained, 'This is so crucial to success. In all areas of life we get maybe one chance, and maybe only 60 seconds, to explain an idea. Those 60 seconds have to contain the idea, the benefits, why it’s needed and why people would want it. That is a truly difficult task, it’s really tough, and so we have professionals who train our entrepreneurs how to pitch. This is the famous elevator pitch.' During the discussion, Mr Kern also put to rest the comparison that is often made between the EIT and MIT. 'Let’s not compare apples and pears. But if you want to compare, let’s check some facts: the MIT was founded in 1861, the EIT started in 2010. The MIT’s budget is EUR 13 billion annually for a single location. The EIT has now EUR 400 million per year for the whole of Europe. MIT has 1000 staff, the EIT has 65 staff. Do you expect the same results? ' Background Mr Kern spoke at the top tier SUMMIT of WEBIT.FESTIVAL, Chaired by the President of Bulgaria and co-hosted by the Head of the European Commission Representation in Bulgaria. The summit aims to address some of the major challenges the humankind faces in today's Digital age. The event is invitation only highest level event gathering political leaders (e.g. Presidents, Vice Presidents and top European political leaders), top entrepreneurs and founders, Nobel Laureates, scientists and innovators along with top enterprise executives from Europe and rest of the world.

12353,EIT_NEWS_0322,2020-07-27,EIT Climate-KIC led  Policy Innovation Taskforce mobilises cities to deliver responses to climate crises," While the challenges of climate change and a global health crisis converge in cities, the economic conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic now present an unprecedented moment in modern urban sustainable development. Are cities ready, willing, and able to respond? Can their leaders and citizens embrace the kind of aggressive innovations needed for them to act on the climate emergency? With the right framing and context, transformative policy measures can deliver climate mitigation and resilience in cities. Achieving this will require a novel approach, one based on careful experimentation and testing on the ground. We need to innovate quickly to learn what we do not yet know how to do. We must experiment and test our best ideas, using a rigorous method for getting results in the time we have. This premise led EIT Climate-KIC and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM) to combine their efforts and convene a global taskforce to invent the policy innovations we need cities to test.  -Thomas Osdoba, Director of Healthy, Clean Cities programme at EIT Climate-KIC. The taskforce met in early June and will be working throughout the next year. The initiative intends to use real-time testing by cities to shorten the deliberation cycle to develop insights quickly and enable the emergence of more refined or advanced policies. The taskforce includes 19 high-profile experts from a wide range of international climate and sustainable development-focused organisations. Creating and testing pathbreaking policy measures in the real world EIT Climate-KIC’s experiences on the ground reveal cities generally have high-level policy goals for long-term decarbonisation of mobility and/or energy systems, usually by 2040 or 2050. These goals, consistent with the Paris Agreement, often lack the specific policy instruments required to achieve these targets. Even with continued calls for greater urgency in our efforts to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, little is in place – even among cities which lead on climate action – to achieve outcomes more quickly. The Policy Innovation Taskforce will move beyond reporting on ‘best practices’ in favour of moving towards an agile mode of policy invention and co-creation, systemically rethinking policymaking by cities. The inventions produced by the taskforce need to be tested in the real world and in real-time as quickly as possible. - Nikhil Chaudhary, Cities Advisor at EIT Climate-KIC. The Global Covenant of Mayors and EIT Climate-KIC will draw insights and strategic lessons from this experimentation to inform even better policy ideas. There will be tightly knit feedback loops of recommendations and learning between pilot cities and the taskforce within this process. The target cities and urban/climate policymakers willing to step up to this challenge are 15 cities EIT Climate-KIC is currently working with across Europe through its Healthy, Clean Cities programme. The 15 cities working with EIT Climate-KIC’s Healthy, Clean Cities programme are the primary target of this policy innovation experimentation. These cities are taking the first step in building a global movement of cities working more urgently to achieve the same impact in this single decade, in keeping with recent calls from the United Nations to move more aggressively to limit global warming to 1.5 C. Once road-tested and refined within this group of cities, GCoM will lead the process of engaging mayors and city practitioners across their 10,000 signatories and 14 Regional Covenants. GCoM also plans to expand the reach of this initiative through a series of consultations through their innovation-focused programme, Innovate4Cities, and with representatives of 25 national governments affiliated with Mission Innovation. An array of policy challenges as a starting point to tackle complexity While the pandemic and climate emergency are daunting challenges for cities, innovative opportunities are opening that previously would have been unthinkable from a policy perspective. Under these circumstances, the initiative has identified a range of crucial policy areas relevant to cities globally, which include: Mobility systems and land-use integration Economic systems, climate budgeting and finance Citizen engagement and social sciences Climate governance, resilience and wellbeing Energy systems and buildings Biodiversity, water and natural ecosystems Public health and crisis management The seven areas listed above create a starting point and will continue to evolve as recommendations are developed and new challenges are uncovered. Moreover, the initiative will explore the interdependencies and interlinkages of policy issues, in service of advancing systems innovation in policymaking. Emerging conversations from the kick-off gathering The virtual meeting gathered multiple perspectives for considering the needed policy innovations. How to classify the overlapping policy areas and consider them holistically was one of the major focal points. One key takeaway was to strike the right balance between deep-dive ‘technical’ domains and embedding cross-cutting issues like resilience, governance, finance, citizen engagement and equity. The problem in my view is that climate action is often considered in isolation. Climate action is contingent on industrial policy, it is contingent on how we build homes and plan our communities and so on, so we must think about it holistically.” – Sophie Howe, Future Generations Commissioner for Wales We need to think about the ‘how’ – how do we approach change. There will be a need for an alignment of leadership and vision in all domains that are affected: governments, citizens, companies, NGOs. All these actors will need to be included structurally in a governance model, one that is driven by a common ambition. This could avoid exclusion and provide a broad platform for change and space for interaction and shared opinions. – Mohamed Ridouani, Mayor of the City of Leuven Several members also stressed the need for urgency in framing innovative policy responses in a post-COVID-19 world. The speed and uncertainty of the current times have brought an additional emphasis on themes, such as systemic risks and resilience, climate-related co-benefits of economic recovery, demand for new governance models, and decision-making. In the coming months, the taskforce’s work shall proceed through smaller sub-committees and will zero in on developing solutions for specific policy challenges. Moving ahead, the premise is that the first set of policy recommendations may not be perfect for all cities. But the act of experimentation, co-design and collective learning will lead everyone to better inform the next generation of policies. Watch this space.

With funding of up to EUR 50 000 for a maximum of one year, the grant supports the applicants in realising the next steps towards the market for innovative products and services. In addition, the successful applicants get access to a European network of world leading medtech, biotech, pharma and IT companies as well as world-class research organisations in healthcare and top universities. They will benefit from unique services in crucial areas such as clinical validation (living labs and test beds), market preparation and internationalisation provided in EIT Health Accelerator programmes such as GoGlobal (MedTech and Digital) or Launchlab. The winners will get early access to the EIT Health Investors Network, which brings international investors together (VCs, Corporate VCs, Business Angels, Crowd Investors) in order to boost the winner’s business idea and to support the participants to increase their visibility across Europe. Six promising projects or start-ups have been selected after the second evaluation cut-off date in 2017 which will be funded by EIT Health: Project-Title: Smartbaseboards Name of Organisation: nevisQ GmbH Website: www.nevisq.com Brief description: nevisQ develops an intelligent sensor system for discrete room monitoring in nursing care facilities in order to relieve the nursing staff and to increase the quality of care. The solution is based on infrared sensor strips, which create a two-dimensional image of a room and recognize objects as well as persons in the room. Machine learning algorithms are used to interpret movements and situations so that for example falls can be clearly identified. The infrared sensor strips can be installed in or above the basebaords a few centimeters over the ground, making them very discreet and easy to install. As soon as the sensor system detects a critical situation of a nursing home resident, such as a fall, the nursing staff is immediately notified to help the fallen person. The advantage here is that the person in need of care does not have to carry a device, such as an emergency button, or has to call actively for help himself. The solution gives nursing homes a competitive advantage and can therefore also increase profitability. At the same time, the nursing homes and the health insurance companies can save costs, for example by a smaller number of falls with serious consequences and a more efficient care work with fewer sick days of the workforce. Project Title: HealthLab MRN 2025 Name of Organisation: OptiMedis AG Website: www.optimedis.de Brief description: Together with OM (manager of “Gesundes Kinzigtal”(GK), a successfully operating population-based integrated care system (ICS) in Germany based on a shared benefits contract with health insurances, and of “Gesundheit für Billstedt/Horn”, another ICS, operating in a deprived municipal neighborhood) MRN is planning to implement a digitally integrated care management model for its 2.4 mil. inhabitants. For this, the area will be split into local regions of 100-150.000 inhabitants. Within each region local providers and patients will be connected using an electronic health record (eHR), the population will be activated and the care provision will be managed inter-sectoral and evidence based. On the metropolitan level these regions will be linked together and provided with central knowledge and services. The overall goal is to establish a highly qualitative and efficient prevention and care provision for the entire metropolitan area and thus increase its attractiveness and position it as a leading European health region for innovation and a test bed for medical research and implementation. The Project would be Germany’s first area-covering population-oriented integrated care of its size. Project Title: PEAIHD Name of Organisation: Avergen Pharmaceuticals GmbH Website: www.avergen.com Brief description: Avergen Pharmaceuticals has identified small molecules that inhibit aggregation of mutated huntingtin (mHtt) at concentrations 400 nM in a cell-based Huntington’s disease (HD) model. Previously, several research groups have shown in mouse models that mHtt aggregation plays a pivotal role in HD. HD is a fatal autosomal dominant orphan drug indication with no disease modifying therapies available. In this in vivo efficacy study, Avergen Pharmaceuticals wants to demonstrate that the early lead compound can inhibit the aggregation of mutated huntingtin and that the inhibition of aggregation consecutively leads to an improvement of motor symptoms in the R6/2 Huntington’s disease model. This proof of efficacy of the early lead compound will be the bases to acquire series A investment and build a team to progress the project further. Project Title: neolexon for Kids Name of Organisation: neolexon UG i. G. Website: www.neolexon.de 	Brief description: neolexon is bringing digitization to the domain of Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) in order to support therapists and patients. SLT aims to improve speech and language abilities, which are either lost due to a brain injury (called Aphasia) or not sufficiently developed as in the case of children. So far, SLT is severely dependent on analogue methods involving picture cards and memory games, which have a variety of disadvantages. neolexon aims to digitize this ecosystem in the form of tablet based apps supported by a handcrafted and medically reliable database. Using the neolexon system, therapists can easily create individual training materials out of a large set of words together with SLT relevant linguistic properties. The training materials are sent to target group-specific training apps in order to enable unlimited training at home. neolexon has so far built a comprehensive German word database and apps for adults effected with Aphasia. In its next steps, neolexon is building apps catering to children thereby establishing an extensive and commercially viable digital SLT solution. Project Title: Implementation of an IT infrastructure for improved medical research Name of Organisation: Climedo Health GmbH Website: www.climedo.de Brief description: Climedo supports the research activity at hospitals by providing doctors with an intelligent software solution to efficiently collect, archive and visualize clinical and biomedical data throughout their research process. Current inefficient management of medical research data in university hospitals, mainly caused by a lack of IT infrastructure, leads to massive losses in quality, time and money. European hospitals need to be fully equipped with smart systems in order to better support doctors in their difficult judgements regarding the interpretation of medical research outcomes. This will ultimately lead to more effective therapies. In the scope of the EIT Health grant, Climedo will conduct a customer-centric software development project at a well-known German university hospital to enable them conduct their research projects more effectively and efficiently. Project Title: Evolution of the Cancer Drug Efficacy CTR-Test® to Promote International Commercialization Name of Organisation: TherapySelect Dr. Frank Kischkel Website: www.therapyselect.de Brief description: Only 25% of cancer patients respond to their applied chemotherapy. To address this problem the CTR-Test (Chemotherapy-Resistance-Test) was developed. The test is a laboratory derived test and can measure efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs on living tumor samples to find the best chemotherapy option for an individual cancer patient. Currently the test is commercially and exclusively offered by TherapySelect. The technology is ready to be out-licensed to other laboratories, but the biggest obstacle for an international commercialization is the usage of radioactivity. Thus within this project the current radioactivity-using CTR-Test version is modified that no radioactivity is needed anymore. In addition the high comparability between the current and modified version is ensured to fulfill all legal requirements for commercialization by performing a direct side-by-side comparison of both versions analyzing patients' tumor samples. 	With this project more cancer patients in Europe and worldwide can benefit from better treatment outcomes, resulting in prolonged life and better quality of life by reducing side effects of ineffective therapies. Reducing ineffective therapies also helps to reduce costs in the healthcare system. Thus our project addresses future challenges of healthcare due to aging societies, demographic change and contributes to the promotion of healthy living, well-being and improvement of healthcare. Active aging is also supported because cancer patients are treated with a more effective therapy. This leads to a higher chance that they recover, stay progression free and do not suffer from limitations caused by their cancer. The next chance for German or Swiss start-ups and SMEs to apply for the EIT Head Start funding will be in spring 2018. The new Head Start call is expected to be published at the end of the year.   Catch up with the latest news from the EIT Community in the Newsroom.

12315,EIT_NEWS_0284,2020-09-16,CleanAIR upgrades older air-conditioning systems to prevent spread of COVID-19," The innovation CleanAIR, supported by EIT Manufacturing, upgrades the functionality of older AC-systems to clean the air and sanitise surfaces during off-hours to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as Covid-19. Airborne droplets that we expel when we breathe, talk, cough or sneeze are a key transmission route of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other infectious diseases. Ensuring safe indoor air is therefore an important prevention measure around the world. Air-conditioning systems installed in homes and offices can both help and hinder the spread of viruses. In some cases, air-conditioning systems can help make air safer by pulling fresh outside air into a building and thereby diluting the viral load in the air. Some air-conditioning system are equipped with advanced filters that help filter the air for virus particulates. However, many older air-condition systems are only designed to recirculate the air in a building, and the AC filters may be far too coarse to catch particles the size of the Coronavirus. CleanAIR is an innovation that received funding from EIT Manufacturing this year as part of the EIT Crisis Response Initiative budget, addresses the fact that older air-conditioning systems installed in homes and offices are often not equipped to clean the air. Led by the Institute for Production Engineering and Photonic Technologies at the Technical University of Vienna, this Austrian-German solution upgrades the functionality of older air-conditioning (AC) systems, to clean the air when the building is in use and it can be used to safely disinfect surfaces during a building’s off-hours. The CleanAIR solution is designed to make indoor environments safer and greatly reduce the transmission of infectious diseases such as Covid-19. A supplemental CleanAIR smart control allows users to choose between a range of cleaning and disinfection strategies. During 2020, the CleanAIR solution received EUR 335 600 from the EIT Crisis Response Initiative budget."

13102,EIT_NEWS_1071,2017-12-08,EIT Health Wild Card Challenges for 2018," AI for patient data and antibiotic resistance Applications will be open between 10 January and 9 March 2018. Developing artificial intelligence that makes better use of patient data and finding new approaches to overcome antibiotic resistance are the two challenges that EIT Health’s new Wild Card Projects should address in 2018, EIT Health COO Jan-Philipp Beck announced on 5 December. The announcement came at the EIT Health Summit in London, where a special session was held to explain the Wild Card Projects, a new type of EIT Health Innovation Project. EIT Health Wild Card Projects are high-risk, innovative projects with transformative potential. The projects are targeted at challenges provided by EIT Health Partners, where the “solution” of the challenge would be a major breakthrough. Each Wild Card Project consists of three distinct steps: Challenges are set through discussions of the EIT Health partnership. Shortlisted candidates who want to participate in Wild Card Projects will be invited to a one week tournament, where winning teams will be formed. The tournament is scheduled for 16-20 April 2018 and the deadline for applying to attend is 9 March 2018. Incubators participating in the programme provide top expertise, facilities and services, to support the winning teams in addressing the challenges. While the chance that teams will succeed is smaller than in typical Innovation Projects, if they do succeed, the results are expected to have a major impact on healthcare. Following a process in which EIT Health Partners were solicited for their input, the two challenges for 2018 were chosen. In more detail the challenges are as follows: Smart Health: Personalised patient data can revolutionise diagnosis and treatment – but the real problem is capturing, storing and making sense of it. The Smart Health challenge sets entrepreneurs the task of building new solutions that use Artificial Intelligence to quickly interpret large, unstructured data sets within existing regulatory frame works, allowing healthcare professionals across the EU to improve patient care. Fight Back: Left unchecked, antibiotic resistance could become Europe’s biggest health crisis. Simple hospital procedures will carry risk again, while old, dangerous diseases could become widespread. The Fight Back challenge tasks entrepreneurs with building innovative solutions to take on antibiotic resistance. The most effective solution must raise awareness of the problem, while also enabling new processes and methodologies to manage it across the EU healthcare landscape. Applications from those who want to take up these challenges open 10 January 2018, so now is a good time to find out more. Please get further information at the new Wild Card Activity page here.

10224,ENISA_NEWS_0773,2014-04-10,Meeting of Central European Cyber Security Platform 2014," Representatives of Governmental, National and Military Teams dealing with “Computer Security Incident Response” as well as National Security Authorities and National Cyber Security Centres from Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, who gathered in Vienna for the third meeting of the Central European Cyber Security Platform (CECSP), consider the concrete progress in the one-year cooperation in cyber security field. Cyber Security Platform (CECSP) CECSP was founded in May 2013 on the initiative of Austria and the Czech Republic. The aim of the Platform is to enable the information, best practices, lesson learned and know-how sharing about cyber threats and potential or (un)successfully carried out cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the Platform shall contribute to the capacity and capability building through common trainings, education, exercises and the research and development coordination. Finally, the participating states strive for harmonized positions in the international environment. Due to the potential sensitive nature of the information in sharing activities the creation of secure communication channels to avoid information leakage and to react in minimum of time will be discussed. Common cross boarder cyber exercises shall be established as well as practical working groups on demand. CECSP-meetings So far the CECSP-meetings were largely devoted to trust-building, mutual acquaintance and exchange of information on the respective country-situation. The priorities of the meeting in Vienna are on the one side the adoption of a working program for the CECSP for the next three years and an agreement about the principles in the cooperation within the CECSP. The results of the Vienna CECSP meeting shall be tested at the first joint cyber exercise in June 2014. Future Objectives In the future the objective of the CECSP is setting up a level of transnational cyber awareness and risk management. This shall be achieved by permanently working on mutual trust and activating the processes of cooperation.       Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

9809,ENISA_NEWS_0358,2018-01-24,Scaling new heights: Implementation and Uptake of Trust Services under the eIDAS Regulation," Driving this trend is the positive response of eIDAS to the requirements of these industries for legal certainty, integrity and shortened time to market. The eIDAS Regulation seeks to facilitate seamless digital transactions among individuals and businesses across the EU and since 1 July 2016, it is directly applicable in all EU Member States. While eIDAS has been broadly seen by stakeholders as a key enabler towards digital transformation, organisations across the board can be greatly facilitated and encouraged to deliver their strategies with confidence should they chose to follow the eIDAS framework. Additionally, the prevailing EU regulatory framework in electronic payments, financial markets, and personal data protection can look upon the eIDAS framework for dependable and compliant solutions to implementation issues at hand. In spite of the patently positive signal for existing and well established Trust services, a gap in the understanding of stakeholders in terms of Trust services still lingers under the eIDAS Regulation. This situation is exacerbated by the ad hoc oligopoly in market niches such as browsers, for instance, as well as in actual stakeholders’ knowledge of concrete implementation models. Member States may still choose to take up the important role of filling potential and actual standardisation gaps. They may also seek to pursue eIDAS compliant implementations when deploying eGovernment services. While the eIDAS Regulation has gone past important milestones and has become a reference point in the EU, it still has some way to go in terms of newly introduced Trust services and broader user acceptance. ENISA seeks to ease up the implementation phase of the eIDAS Regulation and in this regard it regularly produces analyses and reviews on the EU legal framework and standards.

9972,ENISA_PR_0521,2016-05-20,Europol in cooperation with the European Institute of Public Administration hosts conference on privacy and security online ," The conference saw participation from different organisations, public and private, such as the European Data Protection Supervisor, the Europol Joint Supervisory Body, the EU Agency for Network and Information Security -ENISA, Eurojust, Amnesty International, the EastWest Institute and many others from a broad range of professional backgrounds, representing private industry, academia, privacy advocates and law enforcement.   In several high-level discussion panels and workshops lively discussions took place on the polarizing challenges around privacy versus security online, and the need to protect citizens’ privacy while giving law enforcement the means to investigate crime. There was general consensus that the availability and use of encryption and anonymity technologies is not only important and legitimate in many circumstances but essential to a secure and safe cyberspace. One of the main themes at the conference was the dichotomy that encryption and anonymity online presents for law enforcement in terms of supporting strong encryption and opposing any technical solution that would weaken security in cyberspace for everyone, and the criminal abuse of these technologies, which seriously impedes on law enforcement’s ability to protect citizens from criminal and extremist behaviour, and to bring those responsible to justice. As highlighted by Europol’s Director Mr Wainwright, the challenges for law enforcement are very real and lead to a loss of investigative opportunities as a result of the growing misuse of legitimate anonymity and encryption services and tools for illegal purposes. For law enforcement, therefore, the key aspect is to define the modalities of lawful access, within well-defined and regulated boundaries, while fully respecting fundamental rights. Echoing the need for well-defined and regulated boundaries, ENISA's Executive Director Prof Dr Helmbrecht advised: “Do not weaken encryption on purpose; do not inhibit the use of tools for data protection and privacy: promote secure IT. Rushed legislation is often inadequate legislation, we need to give time to discuss and invest into R&D” The event provided a unique opportunity to have an open, inclusive and transparent debate among different viewholders towards finding a way to strike the right balance between freedom and security online. At the end of the conference, Mr Helmbrecht and Mr Wainwright issued a joint statement describing the challenges and proposing possible avenues of solutions for lawful criminal investigations that respect 21st century data protection. Europol is the EU's law enforcement agency, assisting national authorities by exchanging information, intelligence analyses and threats assessments. The agency deals with terrorism and international crime such as cybercrime, drug smuggling and people trafficking. Europol, which has over 1 000 staff members, has its headquarters in The Hague in the Netherlands. ENISA is a centre of expertise for cyber security in Europe. ENISA’s mission is to contribute to securing Europe’s information society by raising awareness of network and information security and to develop and promote a culture, of network and information security in society for the benefit of citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector organizations in the Union.

9995,ENISA_NEWS_0544,2016-03-03,The Netherlands - NCSC publishes factsheet Disable SSL 2.0 and upgrade OpenSSL ," On 1 March, a group of researchers presented the DROWN attack methods for TLS. An attacker uses DROWN to abuse servers that still support SSL 2.0. Servers that run a vulnerable version of OpenSSL can be abused in the same way, regardless of whether they support SSL 2.0. An attacker who is able to intercept network traffic that is secured with TLS, may attempt to decrypt this traffic using the vulnerable server. This allows him to inspect the traffic. The NCSC advises to always configure TLS on the basis of the IT security guidelines for Transport Layer Security. Therefore, disable SSL 2.0, install the most recent updates of OpenSSL and prefer cipher suites that provide forward secrecy on all servers. This factsheet is aimed at IT administrators, information security professionals and IT managers.  Download the factsheet: NCSC Factsheet For more information: NCSC Announcement   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

31022,CEPOL_NEWS_0579,2009-07-14,Information Letter," Dear Colleagues, Friday 10 July 2009, the extended troika of the Police Chiefs Task Force (PCTF) had its meeting in Stockholm. The Swedish Presidency CEPOL Team has approached the PCTF and invited them to bring forward recommendations on training activities to be conducted by the CEPOL network during 2010. The European Commission has appointed Ms. Lotte Knudsen, Acting Director DG JLS/F, to be the Commission’s representative in the Selection Committee, pertaining to the recruitment of a new Director, envisaged to be established at the 17th Governing Board meeting, 6-7 October 2007, in Sweden. The Court of Auditors in Luxembourg adopted the preliminary observations with a view to a report on the annual accounts of CEPOL for the financial year 2008 at its meeting on 17 June 2009. The report will be submitted to you as soon as we have received the comments from the Director. We are supposed to respond to the preliminary observations no later than 30 September 2009. I will come back to you when it comes to the procedures regarding our response. Yours truly, Ebba Sverne Arvill Chair of the Governing Board "
30768,CEPOL_NEWS_0325,2017-04-04,Terrorist threats call for a tightened international cooperation,"CEPOL strongly condemns the heinous attacks perpetrated in the past weeks against the United Kingdom and Russia. Our thoughts go to the victims and their families in these difficult moments. Belgium, France, Germany... were only some of the numerous countries hit by gruesome terrorist attacks last year. In 2016, 1441 terrorist attacks struck the world and made 14356 fatalities. The international community reacted to these threats by mobilising its resources to tackle this issue. Yet, 2017 seems to start in a similar way. London and Saint Petersburg attacks are only a couple of recent ones that were denounced by the EU media. But hundreds of attacks took place all over the world since beginning of 2017 that were left without media coverage. Terrorism has become one of the biggest scourge of our time. The EU has to strengthen its concerted efforts to tailor a solution to the situation. Through its training portfolio, CEPOL will continue to support the efforts of the EU in finding an appropriate solution."
30940,CEPOL_NEWS_0497,2010-08-27,Presidency Meeting in Brussels,"On 18 August, a Presidency meeting took place in Brussels. Representatives of the current Belgian Presidency, incoming Hungarian Presidency and future Polish Presidency, as well as members of CEPOL Secretariat, met to discuss CEPOL’s priorities. When Belgium took over on the 1 July 2010, they already highlighted their planned objectives for the six months, stressing fundamental aspects of the strategic framework in terms of vision, effectiveness, efficiency and high quality of service delivery towards customers, taking into account the European dimension of the achievements. At the meeting, the wish for the continuity of the key actions instigated by the Belgians was discussed. Despite the reorganisation of the Hungarian CEPOL Team, the Hungarian priorities presented by Emese Horvaczy, demonstrate a real spirit of continuity of the objectives defined by the Belgian Presidency and this in a way of extending the training scope. The Polish priorities also follow the same spirit of continuity and Andrzej Zawadzki proposed some very interesting projects, including: ‘managing safety of mass events” and ‘Police Eastern Partnership programme in the field of European neighbourhood policy. All present agreed to the desire to contribute to the improvement of the management of CEPOL. Topics discussed included CEPOL’s Strategic Framework and Balanced Scorecard System, the drawing up of the European Police Exchange Project charter, the annual workflow, budget optimisation and the necessity to plan reserve activities in order to avoid under spending, the five-year evaluation, the promotion of the electronic era and the external relations policy. The Belgian representatives, said: “Our thoughts and actions demonstrated a clear unanimity in the desire to contribute to the improvement of the management of CEPOL in order to maximize the use of financial resources aimed to achieve the core activities”. In addition, Belgium outlined some practical proposals in order to improve the quality of the CEPOL courses, including: ensuring activity reports are made available on CEPOL’s e-Net, a database of trainers, design of courses (workshops, role playing games, etc.,) and ensure the systematic use of the Learning Management System. As CEPOL will celebrate its five year anniversary as an EU agency next year, the spirit of cohesion and continuity clearly established by the Presidency representatives constitutes evidence of harmony. The Belgian representatives will continue to promote CEPOL to the European institutions and undertake to maintain the three axis of its existence: Innovate, Motivate and Educate."
30847,CEPOL_NEWS_0404,2014-05-06,Council of Ministers votes to change the seat of CEPOL,"On 6 May 2014, the Council of Ministers voted in favour for the change of CEPOL’s seat from Bramshill to Budapest. The European Parliament, on 16 April 2014, had previously voted in favour of this amendment to Decision 2005/681/JHA establishing the European Police College (CEPOL). Planning for the relocation is already underway, which will take place once all conditions have been met."

19128,CVPO_NEWS_0057,2020-04-01,Change in CPVO fees regulation as of 1st April 2020,"IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PLANT BREEDERS - We would like to inform all applicants that a decision was taken by the European Commission in 2019 to update the CPVO fees regulation. This decision has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 29 November 2019.  The most significant update concerns examination fees, which are linked to the costs the CPVO pays examination offices for technical examinations. These fees were adjusted to match the real costs of the technical examinations per group category. The new fees are applicable as of 1st April 2020. What has changed on 1st April 2020? For all applications with an application date on 1st April 2020 or later, the following fees are applicable: Application fees: whilst online application fees remain unchanged (EUR 450), paper-based applications now costs EUR 800 instead of EUR 650 previously. Applicants benefiting from the online fee shall only receive electronic communications with the CPVO during the entire application procedure. Examination fees: examination fees are adjusted to reflect the real costs charged by the Examination Offices for each group category – as per the table available below. Annual fees: annual fees remain unchanged. Examination fee per group category - as of 1st April 2020:   Cost group Fee (in EUR) Agricultural group     1 Potato 2 050 2 Oilseed rape 2 150 3 Grasses 2 920 4 Other agricultural species 1 900 Fruit group     5 Apple 3 665 6 Strawberry 3 400 7 Other fruit species 3 460 Ornamental group     8 Ornamental living greenhouse 2 425 9 Ornamental living outdoor 2 420 10 Ornamental non-living greenhouse 2 400 11 Ornamental non-living outdoor 2 200 12 Ornamental special 3 900 Vegetable group     13 Vegetable greenhouse 2 920 14 Vegetable outdoor 2 660 Background The CPVO is a demand-driven agency. Whilst revenues generated by annual fees are relatively stable, revenues generated by application fees and examination fees vary significantly from year to year. As regards costs, the principal component are the examination costs and costs for staff. The CPVO aims to set fees in order to have a balanced budget, and also to respect its Administrative Council decision that the free reserve should be of the order of 50% of the payments budget. In this respect, fees payable to the CPVO by applicants should be reviewed every 4 years. In March 2019, the CPVO Administrative Council invited the European Commission to update the fees regulation to ensure full cost recovery for technical examinations and to keep the annual fees unchanged (Regulation (EC) No 1238/95). The fees were adopted on a proposal of the CPVO Administrative Council and after a public consultation organised by the European Commission. More: The CPVO has updated the “Notes for applicants” in the chapter 7 and in the 3 annexes regarding the increase of the application fee to be paid for paper applications and the increase of the examination fees. The CPVO has also updated the ""Notes on the completion of the application form"" . Both documents are available in 5 languages: English, Dutch, German, French, and Spanish. The Fees & Payments webpage was also updated on 1st April 2020."

24728,EBA_PR_1209,2011-01-13,The EBA announced a new round of stress tests," 	The EBA Board of Supervisors agreed yesterday on a strategic work plan for an EU-wide stress test to take place in the first half of 2011 and to publish results in mid-2011. 	The 2011 stress test will be carried out in cooperation with the national supervisory authorities, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission, and will cover a broadly similar group of banks as last year. 	The methodology and approach taken will build on that used in the 2010 stress test.  The results will be subject to a stringent review and quality control process. 	The objective of the stress test is to assess the resilience of the EU banking system to hypothetical stress events under certain restrictive conditions. The stress test is one of a range of supervisory tools for assessing the strength of individual institutions as well as the overall resilience of the system. 	This stress test is a part of the framework for the assessment of the resilience of the financial sector being built by the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) and will be carried out in parallel with stress tests undertaken by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).

23352,EBA_NEWS_1354,2013-06-25,EBA consults on draft Technical Standards on closely correlated currencies and on appropriately diversified indices," The European Banking Authority publishes today two consultation papers on draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) to identify (i) a list of relevant closely correlated currencies for the purposes of calculating the capital requirements for foreign-exchange risk; and (ii) a list of relevant appropriately diversified indices for the purposes of calculating the capital requirements for equity risk. The consultations of both draft ITS run until 8 September 2013. 	Draft ITS on closely correlated currencies 	These draft ITS provide a list of relevant closely correlated currencies. Currencies are considered to be closely correlated if they meet the specific criteria set out in Article 354 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). Positions in currency pairs that are deemed to be closely correlated are subject to lower capital requirements. 	Each one of the currency pairs assessed by the EBA is the result of a combination between a list of 11 EU and 37 non-EU currencies. The EBA expects to update this list on a yearly basis incorporating any additional relevant currencies as well as the latest available market data. Furthermore, these ITS envisage the possibility of an exceptional and urgent update of the list when market developments require such a review. 	The EBA is requested to submit the final draft ITS on closely correlated currencies to the European Commission by 1 January 2014. 	Draft ITS on appropriately diversified indices 	These draft ITS list relevant exchange traded and appropriately diversified indices for which specific risk incorporated in a stock index can be ignored. The list is based on the following criteria: Number: the index must comprise a minimum number of equities; Concentration: None of the equities or concentration of equities must significantly influence the volatility of the index; Diversification: the index must comprise equities that are diversified both from a geographical and economical perspective. 	The EBA expects to update this list on a yearly basis and to assess any additional indices identified as relevant by 30 September of each year. 	The EBA is requested to submit the final draft ITS on appropriately diversified indices to the European Commission by 1 January 2014. 	Consultation process 	Comments to both consultations can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the ""send your comments"" button on the respective consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 8 September 2013. 	All contributions received will be published following the close of the consultations, unless requested otherwise. 	A public hearing covering a number of Binding Technical Standards on market risk, including the ITS on closely correlated currencies and the ITS on appropriately diversified indices, will take place at the EBA premises on 17 July 2013 from 10:00 to 13:00, UK time.

23869,EBA_NEWS_0349,2017-07-28,ESAs advise on Packaged Retail and Insurance-Based Investment Products with environmental or social objectives," The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) submitted today their Technical Advice to the European Commission to set minimum requirements, which manufacturers of packaged retail and insurance-based investment products with environmental or social objectives (EOS PRIIPs) should comply with to ensure that they offer products that meet the retail investors' needs. 	The manufacturer of an EOS PRIIP is required to install specific governance measures to ensure that environmental or social objectives of the product are met on an ongoing basis. Furthermore, the product has to demonstrate to retail investors throughout the investment process the relevance of these objectives. In its Advice, the ESAs addressed four areas with regard to PRIIPs with environmental or social objectives and included the following recommendations: 	•    The PRIIP manufacturer targeting environmental or social objectives has to clearly specify these objectives, together with an appropriate and proportionate strategy on how to achieve them. 	•    The PRIIP manufacturer should disclose to the retail investors the objectives and how these will be achieved. 	•    The PRIIP manufacturer has to install and well document governance and monitoring measures, where the latter need to be proportionate to the objectives and strategy how to achieve the objectives. 	•    The PRIIP manufacturer should conduct regular reviews on the progress made in achieving the specified and disclosed objectives. 	Acknowledging the cross-sectorial dimension and the need for the rigorous assessment to address potential gaps, the ESAs specified, for each of these four areas, the required regulatory outcome and an assessment of existing rules. 	The ESAs concluded that at this time the establishment of specific and detailed standalone obligations for PRIIPs targeting specific environmental or social objectives would not be proportionate. Existing sectoral measures offer already, or are already in the process of putting in place, a sufficiently stringent and flexible basis for the sound regulation of PRIIPs targeting environmental and social objectives. 	The Technical Advice can be viewed here 	Background 	Packaged retail investment and insurance products (PRIIPs) cover the range of investment products marketed to retail investors, in the European Union a market worth up to €10 trillion. They include structured products, whatever their underlying legal form and including structured deposits, insurance-based investments (including unit-linked and with-profit products), and all kinds of investment funds. 	  "
23526,EBA_NEWS_0006,2020-02-14,EBA acknowledges adoption of amended supervisory reporting standards by the European Commission," The European Banking Authority (EBA) acknowledged today the adoption by the European Commission of the Implementing Act amending Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (Implementing Technical Standards on Supervisory Reporting) with regard to COREP and FINREP changes. The Implementing Act, which is based on the final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on supervisory reporting submitted by the EBA in July 2019, was adopted by the Commission on 14 February 2020 but its publication in the EU Official Journal is still pending. The amendments to the reporting framework will apply with different reference dates due to different application dates of the underlying regulatory requirements. The first reference date, concerning COREP changes, will be 31 March 2020 (reporting framework v2.9).The COREP amendments concern the new securitisation framework and changes to LCR to align with the LCR amending Act;The FINREP amendments concern the reporting requirements on non-performing exposures (NPE) and forbearance to allow the monitoring of reporting institutions' NPE strategies, the reporting requirements on profit and loss items and the implementation of the new International Financial Reporting Standard on leases (IFRS 16).All the related documents published on the EBA's website have been updated to reflect the adoption of the Implementing Act (see Reporting framework 2.9).Click here to access the Implementing Act and annexes as adopted by the European Commission.  "
22999,EBA_PR_1001,2015-07-16,EBA proposes corrections to the adopted technical standards on identified staff," The European Banking Authority (EBA) issued today amendments to the adopted Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the criteria to identify categories of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on an institution's risk profile. These RTS were published by the European Commission as Delegated Act on 6 June 2014. 	During the legal adoption process of these RTS, The European Commission introduced changes, which have inadvertently altered their meaning. The EBA is, therefore, proposing to amend the text of this Delegated Act to ensure it reflects the intention of the text originally submitted to the European Commission in December 2013. "
23534,EBA_PR_0014,2020-01-31,EBA releases its annual assessment of the consistency of internal model outcomes," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today two Reports on the consistency of risk weighted assets (RWAs) across all EU institutions authorised to use internal approaches for the calculation of capital requirements. The reports cover credit risk for high and low default portfolios (LDPs and HDPs), as well as market risk. The results confirm that the majority of risk-weights (RWs) variability can be explained by fundamentals. These benchmarking exercises are a fundamental supervisory and convergence tool to address unwarranted inconsistencies and restoring trust in internal models.Credit Risk exerciseThe credit risk Report examines the different drivers leading to the observed dispersion across banks' models. The results are broadly in line with previous exercises, with 50% of the difference in variability explained with simple risk drivers (“top down analysis”), a RW deviation on LDPs below 10 percentage points (“common counterparty analysis”) and estimates for HDPs generally on the conservative side when compared with empirical observed metrics (“backtesting analysis”).Furthermore, this year, for the first time, on HDPs, the EBA performed a comparison with the standardised approach (SA) risk weights. The overall observed variability under the SA is at a similar level than the one observed on IRB. In this regard, within a single exposure class, the variability under the IRB approach follows, in a conservative manner, the empirical variability of risk (observed via default rates). On the other side, it is worth noting that the variability of RWAs in the SA is less linked to the empirical risk variability.As in previous years, the quantitative analysis is complemented with a qualitative one in order to better understand the quantitative metric of the exercise. In addition to a questionnaire filled in by supervisors and interviews conducted with seven institutions, a survey was carried out among institutions to better assess the variability of practices in terms of rating scales. This survey highlights the variability of practices on the type of calibration of the probability of default (PDs).Market Risk exerciseThe Report presents the results of the 2019 supervisory benchmarking and summarises the conclusions drawn from a hypothetical portfolio exercise (HPE) that was conducted by the EBA during 2018/19.The 2019 exercise is the first exercise with the new set of hypothetical instruments and portfolios. The new set of instruments mainly consists of vanilla instruments and is more extensive in terms of the number of instruments to model with respect to the three previous benchmarking exercises. Compared to the previous exercises, the 2019 analysis shows a substantial reduction in terms of dispersion in the initial market valuation and some reduction in risk measures, especially for the aggregated portfolios. This improvement was expected and is likely due to the simplification in the market risk benchmarking instruments. The remaining dispersion is probably the result of new benchmarking instruments being used by banks for the first timeAs for the dispersion, the bulk of it has been examined and justified by the banks and the competent authorities. A minor part of the outlier observations remain unexplained and are expected to be part of the on-going supervisory activities.The quantitative analysis, which has been extended in terms of scope with respect to the previous exercises, was also complemented by a questionnaire to competent authorities. Although the majority of the causes were identified, and actions put in place to reduce the unwanted variability of the hypothetical RWAs, the effectiveness of these actions can be evaluated only with on-going analysis.Note to the editorsThese annual benchmarking exercises contribute to the work the EBA is conducting for improving the regulatory framework, increase convergence of supervisory practices and, thus, restoring confidence in internal models. For credit risk internal models, the EBA has followed its roadmap for the implementation of the regulatory review of internal models.This exercise should be read in parallel with other efforts to reduce undue levels of variability. In particular, the  EBA roadmap to repair IRB models is a key component of the review of the IRB framework, along with the enhancements brought by the final Basel III framework assessed by the EBA in a set of recommendations as an answer to the call for advice of the European Commission.The exercises provide a regular supervisory tool based on benchmarks to support competent authorities' assessments of internal models and produce comparisons with EU peers. "
22856,EBA_PR_0858,2016-05-12,EBA agrees with the Commission on changes to the amended technical standards on benchmarking of internal approaches," The European Banking Authority (EBA) issued today an Opinion to the European Commission expressing agreement with its proposed amendments to the EBA Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on benchmarking of internal approaches. These amendments, which were agreed with the EBA building on the experience of the 2014-15 benchmarking exercise, aim at ensuring a better quality of the submitted data and, ultimately, at strengthening the benchmarking analysis performed by the EBA and Competent Authorities. The EBA plans to annually update the ITS and to maintain them on a regular basis to ensure the success and quality of future benchmarking exercises. 	Next steps for 2016 and future benchmarking exercise 	The amended ITS on benchmarking of internal approaches will allow the EBA to run its 2016 exercise based on the data requirements specified in the amended standards. In particular, the 2016 exercise will cover credit risk for the so-called high-default portfolios (small and medium enterprises and retail) and market risk portfolios as well as some information about the models used to produce the results. 	  	All EU institutions using internal approaches to calculate capital requirements will be subject to an assessment of their internal approaches and are required to submit to their Competent Authorities the data on those portfolios by close of business on 30 June 2016. 	  	Changes to the ITS will be applied annually since some features of the instruments or counterparties included in the benchmarking portfolios require regular updating as they may become obsolete  or cease to exist. 	  	The EBA is currently taking into consideration the changes to the portfolios relevant for the 2017 exercise. These too will be transmitted to the European Commission and published after the adoption by the EBA Board of Supervisors. 	Background 	The ITS on benchmarking of internal approaches were published and submitted to the European Commission in March 2015. On 20 April 2016 the latter informed the EBA that it intended to adopt the ITS with amendments proposed to the EBA building on the experience of the 2014-15 benchmarking exercise. 	  "
23792,EBA_NEWS_0272,2018-02-23,EBA issues Opinion on measures to address macroprudential risk," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today an Opinion following the notification by the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) of its intention to modify capital requirements in order to address an increase in macroprudential risk. Based on the evidence submitted by the NBB, the EBA does not object to the adoption of the proposed measure, which is based on Article 458 (2) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). This new measure aims at enhancing the resilience of Belgian banks to potential severe downward corrections in residential real estate markets. 	  	In particular, the NBB notified the EBA of its intention to introduce a new macroprudential measure based on two components.  The first one consists of a flat 5 pp risk weight add-on to the microprudential risk weight for mortgage exposures for IRB banks (identical to the measure that expired in May 2017). The second one is a more targeted component that would further increase risk weights in line with the risk profile of the bank's mortgage portfolio by applying an additional proportional 33% macroprudential risk weight add-on on top of the microprudential risk weight, which is to be applied to each (IRB) bank's (residential) mortgage portfolio.  	  	In its Opinion, addressed to the Council, the European Commission and the NBB, the EBA acknowledges, in line with the ESRB warning on the vulnerabilities of the residential real estate sector, that the combined increase in house prices and debt levels could pose a threat to the financial stability of banks in Belgium in the event of a downturn. In light of this conclusion, the EBA does not object to the deployment, by the NBB, of its proposed macroprudential measure.  	  "
22659,EBA_PR_0661,2017-07-31,EBA reports show that banks funding plans paint an optimistic outlook for growth whilst NPLs remain a drag on EU banks new lending," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today two reports on EU banks' funding plans and asset encumbrance respectively. The reports aim to provide important information for EU supervisors to assess the sustainability of banks' main sources of funding. The results of the assessment show that banks plan to increase their lending and to expand deposits as well as market based funding.Forecasted loan growth to be funded by client deposits and issuance of long term debtThe EBA asked 155 banks for their plans for funding over 3 years to 2019. These plans show that, on average, total assets are projected to grow by 3.9% between 2016 and 2019. The main drivers for asset growth are loans to households and to non-financial corporates. Further analysis suggests that high NPL levels combined with more thinly capitalised banks could be a drag on new lending unless addressed.Client deposits remain the main component in EU banks' funding mix with a share of more than 50%. Banks forecast an expansion of deposits, which will require careful monitoring, at both an individual and system level. Planned issuances of debt securities in 2017 also looks set to increase in 2018 and 2019. In addition, the plans suggest that the share of covered bonds as a source of asset encumbrance will continue its rising trend. The outlook for funding plans should be seen in the context of the need to issue further minimum requirements for eligible liabilities (MREL) and the wind down of central banks' funding support measures. Amid such trends, banks' forecasted reliance on interest income to improve profitability will require careful monitoring.Asset encumbrance increased slightly in 2016The asset encumbrance report, which is backward looking, shows that in December 2016, the overall weighted average encumbrance ratio stood at 26.6% against 25.4% in December 2015. However, the report highlights a wide dispersion across institutions and countries, which is consistent with what was observed in the previous report.Besides covered bonds, the main sources of asset encumbrance are repos and over-the-counter derivatives. Some of the countries particularly affected by the sovereign debt crisis showed a decreased dependence towards the use of central bank funding, which could reflect a general improvement of the funding situation in these countries.Notes to editorsThe reports issued today were carried out on the basis of data submissions on funding plans and asset encumbrance. Whereas the funding plan data has a forward looking perspective, the report on asset encumbrance is based on data for the period from December 2014 to December 2016. The two reports shall be published on an annual basis. LinksRisk Assessment ReportsEBA Data Visualisation toolThematic report introductory video "
23942,EBA_NEWS_0422,2017-03-02,EBA consults on the coverage of entities in banking group recovery plans," The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a consultation on its draft Recommendation on the coverage of entities in banking group recovery plans, which is aimed at defining common criteria to identify entities (subsidiaries and branches) that need to be covered in group recovery plans, and the extent of such coverage. Such criteria should help institutions avoid a fragmented approach in providing information in recovery plans, and provide a common guidance for home and host supervisors. The consultation runs until 02 June 2017. 	  	The draft Recommendation envisages that the coverage of entities in a group recovery plan needs to be proportional, so that the amount of information will vary according to relevance of the entities. The EBA, therefore, recommends that – for recovery planning purposes - entities should be categorised as (i) relevant for the group, (ii) relevant for the economy or financial system of a relevant member state or (iii) not relevant for neither of the two. Different levels of information are identified for each category.  A transitional phase is included to allow the incorporation of available information from existing individual plans into group plans. 	  	While the draft Recommendation does not interfere with the tasks and responsibilities of the home and host Competent Authorities under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), it is designed to limit requests for individual plans, based on an inadequate coverage of an entity in the group recovery plans. The Recommendation is also designed to support the effective assessment of group recovery plans in the context of the joint decision process on Recovery plans. 	  	Consultation process 	Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the ""send your comments"" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 02 June 2017. 	  	All contributions received will be published following the close of the consultation, unless requested otherwise. A public hearing will then take place at the EBA premises on 20 April 2017 from 13.00 to 16.00 UK time. 	  	Legal basis  	The EBA has drafted this Recommendation on its own initiative in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. The draft recommendation elaborates on the existing legal frameworks established by the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the EU Commission Delegated Regulation 1075/2016, and builds on the experience the EBA has gained through thematic reviews of recovery plans as well as through its regular attendance of several colleges of supervisors.  	  "
24131,EBA_PR_0611,2015-12-17,EBA issues methodology for valuation of liabilities arising from derivatives," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today the final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the methodology for the valuation of derivative liabilities for the purpose of bail-in in resolution. These standards, which have been developed within the framework of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) setting procedures for the orderly management of bank failures, provide EU resolution authorities with a methodology for the valuation of derivative liabilities of credit institutions placed under resolution and ensure that the discipline brought in by the new bail-in tool can effectively be extended to these liabilities too. 	The EBA provided EU resolution authorities with a series of tools to carry out a swift and objective valuation of derivative liabilities, while minimising risks of breaching the principle that no creditor should be treated worse off than in liquidation. The approach applies a statutory valuation methodology based on the costs or gains that would be incurred by the counterparty in replacing the contract. 	Derivative counterparties will be given the opportunity to provide evidence of commercially reasonable replacement trades within a certain deadline; if they do not exercise this option, then resolution authorities will apply a statutory methodology supported by observable market data or other relevant information. 	Resolution authorities may establish the value of derivative liabilities as on the close-out date or as on the date when a price is available in the market. For centrally cleared derivatives, the final draft RTS take into account the applicable regulatory framework under the EU Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and provides for a process that relies in principle on the Central Counterparty (CCP) default and valuation processes. 	When adopted by the Commission, these draft RTS will allow resolution authorities to conclude a potential resolution action including derivative liabilities on the basis of a reliable valuation in a short timeframe. In cases of particular urgency, resolution authorities may also apply resolution actions on the basis of provisional valuations. 	Legal basis 	These draft RTS have been developed according to paragraph 5 of Article 49 of Directive 2014/59/EU (BRRD), which mandates the EBA to develop draft RTS specifying methodologies and principles on the valuation of liabilities arising from derivatives.

23344,EBA_NEWS_1346,2013-07-12,EBA consults on draft technical standards on the hypothetical capital of a central counterparty," The European Banking Authority (EBA) launches today a consultation on draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on the reporting of the hypothetical capital of a central counterparty (CCP). These ITS will be part of the Single Rulebook aimed at enhancing regulatory harmonisation in the banking sector in Europe. The consultation runs until 30 September 2013. 	This set of draft ITS relates to prudential requirements for banks' exposures to central counterparties. In particular, they specify a reporting frequency on a quarterly basis and the template for the information that a CCP has to deliver to all credit institutions and investment firms that are clearing members, as well as to the supervisory authorities competent for those clearing members. Furthermore, the draft ITS specify the conditions under which the supervisory authorities may request an increase in the reporting frequency. 	Consultation process 	Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the ""send your comments"" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 30 September 2013. 	All contributions received will be published following the close of the consultation, unless requested otherwise. 	A public hearing will take place at the EBA premises on 5 September 2013 from 15:00 to 17:00 hours UK time.

23403,EBA_NEWS_1405,2012-11-29,Publication of the Credit institutions Register," 	The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today an updated list of credit institutions authorised to operate within the European Union and European Economic Area countries. 	The list is based on information received from National competent authorities as of 30 June 2012. 	As underlined in the Directive 2006/48/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (link to be added), the so-called CRD, the granting of licences to credit institutions remains under the remit of the competent authority at national level. The European Banking Authority was established by Regulation (EC) No. 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010. The EBA has officially come into being as of 1 January 2011 and has taken over all existing and ongoing tasks and responsibilities from the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS). The EBA acts as a hub and spoke network of EU and national bodies safeguarding public values such as the stability of the financial system, the transparency of markets and financial products and the protection of depositors and investors.

22766,EBA_PR_0768,2016-12-14,EBA publishes final guidelines on revised Pillar 3 disclosures requirements," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final Guidelines on regulatory disclosure requirements following an update of the Pillar 3 requirements by the Basel Committee in January 2015. These Guidelines represent a significant step forward in the EBA's effort of improving and enhancing the consistency and comparability of institutions' regulatory disclosures 	  	Following the release by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) of a revised version of the Pillar 3 framework (RPF) in January 2015, the EBA published its own initiative Guidelines to ensure the harmonised and timely implementation of the RPF in the EU. These Guidelines while not changing the requirements of the regulatory disclosures defined in Part Eight of the CRR, provide further guidance and support to institutions in complying with both the CRR and the RPF requirements.  	  	In particular, the Guidelines cover the entire content of the RPF, with the exception of securitisation requirements, which are currently under discussions at EU level following the finalisation of a revised securitisation framework at the international level, and other disclosure requirements in Part Eight of the CRR for which there are already EBA Delegated or Implementing Regulations or guidelines, such as own funds and leverage ratio. 	The Guidelines apply to Globally and Other Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs and O-SIIs). Competent authorities may still require institutions that are neither G-SIIs nor O-SIIs to apply some or all the guidance provided for in these Guidelines when complying with the requirements in Part Eight of the CRR. 	  	Nonetheless, proportionality is embedded in the different disclosure templates and tables. Therefore, smaller, less sophisticated or less complex institutions are expected to have a lower risk profile and will not be subject to all the disclosure requirements. In addition, the concept of materiality allows institutions to tailor the granularity and the frequency of their disclosures. 	The Guidelines apply from 31 December 2017, but G-SIIs are encouraged to comply with a subset of those Guidelines as soon as 31 December 2016. 	Legal basis and background 	These final Guidelines have been developed on the EBA's own initiative in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and will complement the EBA Guidelines on liquidity risk disclosures, currently under consultation. 	  	These Guidelines are part of the multifaceted work undertaken by the EBA to improve the consistency and comparability of institutions' disclosures. Other initiatives that took place in 2016 include the dissemination of individual data as part of the 2016 EU-wide transparency exercise and the 2016 EU-wide stress test exercise. "
23288,EBA_PR_1290,2013-12-02,EBA publishes XBRL taxonomy for remittance of supervisory reporting by competent regulatory authorities," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its XBRL taxonomy to be used for remittance of data under the Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on supervisory reporting.  The taxonomy defines a representation for data collection under the reporting requirements related to own funds, financial information, losses stemming from lending collateralised by immovable property, large exposures, leverage ratio and liquidity ratios. It presents the data items, business concepts, relations, visualisations and validation rules described by the EBA Data Point Model contained in the ITS on supervisory reporting. 	Uniform data formats are necessary to enable the exchange of reported data regarding groups of credit institutions and investment firms, as part of the operation of the Single Rulebook aimed at enhancing regulatory harmonisation in the banking sector in the EU and facilitating a proper functioning of cross-border supervision. In this respect, this taxonomy will lead to greater efficiency in and convergence of supervisory practices across Members States, facilitating the supervisory process and allowing supervisors to identify and assess risks consistently across the EU and to compare EU banks in an effective manner. 	Although primarily developed for use in data transmission between competent authorities and the EBA, many authorities are known to intend to use the proposed XBRL taxonomy for the collection of supervisory reporting from the credit institutions and investment firms they supervise. Where so used by competent authorities, this harmonised reporting format is therefore expected to lead to greater efficiency and lower costs of regulatory compliance for credit institutions and investment firms in Europe. 	The taxonomy package released today includes the following technical documents: 		The set of XML files forming the XBRL taxonomy 		A description of the architecture of the XBRL taxonomy 		Filing rules specifying requirements and guidelines for creating instance files (reports) that use the taxonomy 		Sample reports for illustrative purposes 		The Data Point Model of which the taxonomy is a standardised technical implementation (for reference), including both database and document representations, along with a description of the formal modelling approach on which it is based. Legal basis and next steps 	This XBRL taxonomy has been developed based on the final draft ITS and DPM on supervisory reporting (and incorporating some revisions arising from the publication and adoption process, see below), in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (colloquially known as Capital Requirements Regulation or CRR). 	The ITS and DPM are pending publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,  and adoption as EU Regulations that will be directly applicable throughout the EU, and hence this taxonomy is subject to any further necessary revisions to these source materials arising during this publication and adoption process and/or any critical technical corrections that may be identified. 	In the first half of 2014, the EBA is expected to publish an update to this taxonomy incorporating additional reporting requirements regarding asset encumbrance, non-performing loans and forbearance.

23019,EBA_PR_1021,2015-06-18,EBA updates on consumer trends in 2015," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its fourth annual Consumer Trends Report. The report, which covers all the products that fall into the EBA's consumer protection mandate, such as mortgages, personal loans, deposits, payment accounts, payment services and electronic money, highlights the trends the EBA has observed with these products in 2015 and the issues that may arise, or have arisen, for consumers buying them. It also provides early indications as to the areas in which the EBA may take action going forward. In addition, the report summarises all the measures the EBA has taken to address these issues.  	  	In 2015, the EBA identified eight relevant trends that may be the basis for potential future work in the area of consumer protection. Of these eight trends, six remain since last year's report, namely: household indebtedness, with a specific focus on mortgages; transparency and comparability of banking fees; innovation in payments; structured deposits; commercial selling practices and remuneration, in particular, as a key causal driver of mis-selling; and alternative financial services providers. For the first time, the report highlighted two trends, such as the use of banking consumer data, which is increasingly used by financial and other institutions to generate additional revenue; and negative interest rates and its effects on consumer contracts, both on deposits and loans. 	  	The EBA has already started to address some of these trends, and will use the findings of the report as input when developing and publishing its work programme for 2016, later this year. 	  	The report also summarises how the EBA has addressed the issues identified in last year's report. The measures taken include one Regulatory Technical Standard on the minimum amount of professional indemnity insurance, two Guidelines on provisional lists of most representative services linked to a payment account and on security of internet payments, three consultation papers on draft guidelines on creditworthiness assessments, on arrears and foreclosure, and on product oversight and governance, and two opinions on virtual currencies and on lending-base crowdfunding.     	Background and legal basis 	The EBA resorted to a number of different sources for data and information when identifying trends for 2015. These include national supervisory authorities across the 28 EU Member States, the EBA Banking Stakeholder Group (BSG), national Ombudsmen across the European Economic Area, via the Financial Dispute Resolution Network (FIN-NET), as well as statistical datasets and reports produced by independent research institutes and other organisations. 	  	Article 9 of the EBA Regulation requires the EBA to take a leading role in promoting transparency, simplicity and fairness in the market for consumer financial products or services across the internal market, including by collecting, analysing and reporting on consumer trends. 	  "
23974,EBA_PR_0454,2016-12-14,EBA publishes final draft technical standards on cooperation and exchange of information for passporting under PSD2," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) specifying the framework for cooperation and exchange of information between Competent Authorities for passport notifications under the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). The technical standards will ensure that information about payment institutions and e-money institutions that carry out business in one or more EU Member States is exchanged consistently between the national authorities of the home and host Member States.  	  	The final draft RTS set out a harmonised framework for cooperation and exchange of information between Competent Authorities to facilitate cross-border provision of payment services in the EU internal market. They also address some of the concerns that had been raised by the industry during the consultation period.  	  	In order to enhance transparency, the final draft RTS foresee that payment institutions are informed when the passport notification is transmitted from the Competent Authority in the home Member State to the authority in the host Member State. The template passport notifications were also amended to include the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), where available.  	  	Furthermore, the final draft RTS require separate templates for agents and distributors in order to increase clarity with regard to the information that is to be provided when a payment institution or e-money institution is using an agent and when an e-money institution is using a distributor when providing services in another EU Member State. However, given the legal remit of the RTS, the EBA was unable to address the related concerns raised during the consultation as to whether or not a passporting activity via an agent or a distributor is to be regarded as an establishment. Instead, the templates cater for both possible scenarios (right of establishment or freedom to provide services) in which an agent or distributor may operate and clarify that the information transmitted to the host Authority regarding the nature of the passporting reflects the assessment of the home Authority. In addition, in order to enhance transparency, in cases where the home Authority considers that the use of agents or distributors does not constitute an establishment, the final draft RTS provide for additional information to be transmitted to the host Authority regarding the circumstances that were taken into account by the home Authority in its assessment.  	  	The EBA also published a diagram to help Competent Authorities of the home Member States identify the templates they have to use.  	Legal basis 	These final draft RTS have been developed in accordance with Article 28(5) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on payment services in the internal market (PSD2), which mandates the EBA to develop draft RTS specifying the framework for cooperation and exchange of information between Competent Authorities for passporting. 	  "
22801,EBA_PR_0803,2016-10-03,EBA publishes final Guidelines on implicit support for securitisation transactions," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final Guidelines on implicit support for securitisation transactions. The objective of these Guidelines is to clarify what constitutes arm's length conditions and to specify when a transaction is not structured to provide support for securitisations. The Guidelines will contribute towards the successful implementation of the Commission's securitisation package under the Capital Markets Union reform, giving clarity on the matter to credit institutions. 	  	The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) sets out restrictions on the provision of implicit support to securitisations, as this raises supervisory concerns and undermines the achievement of significant risk transfer. If originator or sponsor institutions fail to comply with the relevant requirements, they shall, at a minimum, hold own funds against all of the securitised exposures as if such exposures had not been securitised. 	  	These Guidelines propose an objective test for the definition of arm's length conditions and for assessing when a transaction is not structured to provide support. Furthermore, guidance is provided on the notification requirements applicable to such transactions and provisions are included to avoid a scenario whereby support is provided on behalf of the originator by another entity.  	  	The final Guidelines take into account the feedback received during the public consultation and should be read in conjunction with the Guidelines on significant risk transfer.    	Legal basis and background 	The final Guidelines have been developed pursuant to Article 248 CRR, which lays down restrictions on sponsor institutions and originator institutions providing support to securitisations beyond their contractual obligations. In particular, Article 248(2) of the CRR sets out a specific mandate for the EBA to issue guidelines on what constitutes arm's length conditions and when a transaction is not structured to provide support. 	  "
23991,EBA_PR_0471,2016-11-10,EBA provides its views on the implementation of IFRS 9 and its impact on banks across the EU," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a Report including some qualitative and quantitative observations of its first impact assessment of IFRS 9. This exercise, which helped the EBA understand the way in which institutions are preparing for the application of IFRS 9, also contains some recommendations relevant to the observations as well as some future actions, including the interaction of IFRS 9 with existing prudential requirements. 	  	Qualitative and quantitative observations 	On the qualitative side, the Report highlights that as of December 2015, when the exercise was launched, banks were, overall, still at an early stage of preparation for the implementation of IFRS 9, although larger banks seemed more advanced. Also, the Report shows that many respondents plan to perform parallel runs to test the implementation of IFRS 9, but this testing may, in some cases, be more limited than originally envisaged. It should also be noted that at the time the exercise was carried-out, banks still needed to make some key accounting policy decisions.  	  	On the quantitative side, the responses received show that the estimated impact of IFRS 9 is mainly driven by IFRS 9 impairment requirements. The estimated increase of provisions is on average 18% (and up to 30% for 86% of the respondents) compared to the current levels of provisions under IAS 39. The common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratios are expected to decrease on average by up to 59 basis points (bps) (and up to 75 bps for 79% of the respondents). In limited cases the impact of IFRS 9 could be higher. 	  	Next steps and other EU initiatives 	The EBA will closely monitor the implementation by EU institutions of IFRS 9 over time and also encourages banks to continue their efforts towards a high quality implementation of the stand-ard. To this end, the EBA will continue to engage in an on-going dialogue with banks and auditors and welcomes further discussion with stakeholders on aspects relating to interactions with pru-dential requirements. 	  	Following the analysis of the information collected in the first exercise, the EBA is launching a second impact assessment. As banks are expected to have further developed their methodologies towards the implementation of IFRS 9, the new exercise will allow the EBA to better understand the possible impact of IFRS 9 and the way it is being implemented. 	  	In parallel, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published today a public statement on issues to be considered when implementing IFRS 9, which highlights both the need for consistent, high-quality implementation of IFRS 9 and the need for transparency on its impact to users of financial statements.  	  "
22528,EBA_PR_0530,2018-07-11,EBA issues recommendation to the Maltese Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit in relation to its supervision of Pilatus Bank," The European Banking Authority (EBA) issued today a Recommendation addressed to the Maltese Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) after establishing it had breached Union law in relation to its supervision of Pilatus Bank. The EBA Recommendation aims at remedying the particular failings identified by the EBA by encouraging the FIAU to take all the necessary actions to comply with the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Terrorism Financing Directive (AML/CTF). 	  	Following the European Commission's request of 23 October 2017, to investigate a possible breach of Union law (BUL) regarding the apparent failure of the Maltese FIAU and the Maltese Financial Service Authority (MFSA) to effectively supervise Pilatus Bank Ltd in relation to its AML/CFT obligations, the EBA conducted a preliminary enquiry, including an on‐site visit to the Maltese competent authorities. In particular, the EBA's preliminary enquiry on the FIAU aimed at understanding the extent to which its approach to AML/CFT supervision and enforcement in relation to Pilatus Bank Limited had been effective and in line with Union law.  	  	On 23 May 2018, the EBA Chairperson, having consulted with the Alternate Chairperson, opened an investigation into a possible BUL by the Maltese FIAU. The EBA concluded that the FIAU failed to conduct an effective supervision of Pilatus Bank due to a number of failures, including procedural deficiencies and lack of supervisory actions by the FIAU after its decision to close the case without imposing any sanctions on the bank. 	  	Despite the several measures taken by the FIAU to remedy the identified failures, the EBA deemed these measures as not sufficient to satisfy the deficiencies that led to the launch of a BUL investigation. Therefore, the EBA called on the FIAU to adopt recommendations aimed at addressing the identified shortcomings. In particular, the EBA asked the FIAU to take actions to systematically assess the ML/TF risk associated with the Maltese financial sector; to supervise the effectiveness of the AML/CFT policies and procedures put in place by the obliged entities; to ensure enough resources are available and robust procedures are in place to supervise its obliged entities. 	Legal basis and next steps 	The Recommendation has been issued in accordance with Article 17 of the EBA's Founding Regulation regarding the BUL powers conferred to the Authority in case of non-compliance with Union law by competent authorities.  	  	In accordance with the second paragraph of Article 17(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, the FIAU shall inform the EBA within 10 working days of receipt of this recommendation of the steps it has taken or intends to take to ensure compliance with Union law. 	  	The EBA's preliminary enquiries in relation to the MFSA are still ongoing. 	  "
22488,EBA_NEWS_0490,2018-11-08,ESAs consult on proposed changes to the key information document for PRIIPs," The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) have today issued a consultation paper on targeted amendments to the Delegated Regulation covering the rules for the Key Information Document (KID) for Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs). 	The ESAs, on 1 October 2018, set out in a letter to the European Commission their intention to make proposals to support legislative changes to avoid the possibility of duplicating information requirements for investment funds from 1 January 2020, and to tackle key issues that have arisen since the implementation of the KID. The consultation paper addresses, in particular, amendments to the information regarding investment products' performance scenarios. 	The proposals are made in the context of the ongoing discussions between the European co-legislators on the application of the KID by certain investment funds as well as the timing of a wider and more comprehensive review of PRIIPs, which was due this year. The outcome of this targeted review is without prejudice to that wider review, and it would be beneficial to conduct such a wider review early in the next term of the European Parliament.   	In addition, when deciding upon the nature of their final recommendations following this consultation in January 2019, the ESAs will take into account the feedback from respondents to this consultation and the latest information of these political discussions on the application of the KID by certain investment funds and the timing of the wider review. 	The deadline for submission of feedback is by Thursday, 6 December 2018. 	Background The KID for PRIIPs is a mandatory, three-page A4 information document to be provided to consumers before purchasing a PRIIP. PRIIPs include for example funds, structured products, unit-linked and with-profits life insurance contracts, and structured deposits. The PRIIPs Regulation (No 1286/2014) defines the main rules and principles for KIDs. It is supplemented by a Delegated Regulation (2017/653) specifying the presentation and contents of the KID, which is based on Regulatory Technical Standards that the ESAs were mandated to develop. Performance scenarios are included in the Section of the KID titled ""What are the risks and what could I get in return?"" They indicate how the investment could perform under various different scenarios. "
23282,EBA_NEWS_1284,2013-12-12,EBA consults on methodology for global systemically important institutions," The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on the methodology for identifying Global Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs). The work aims at ensuring a transparent identification process in line with international regulatory work on global systemically important banks. The public consultation runs until 28 February 2014 and covers the draft RTS on the methodology for identifying G-SIIs, and draft ITS and Guidelines on the disclosure of the value of indicators used in the identification process. 	The draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) provide consistent parameters and specify a harmonised methodology for identifying G-SIIs and determining adequate levels of own funds across the European Union. The Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) requires that each year Member States' authorities calculate an individual score to measure a bank's systemic significance. Five categories of indicators to be used in this scoring process are defined in the CRD and the EBA draft RTS specify twelve further sub-indicators falling under these categories. 	The draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) define uniform disclosure requirements to publicise the values used for the identification and scoring process for G-SIIs. These ensure fair competitive conditions between comparable groups of institutions, resulting in greater convergence of supervisory practices and more accurate risk assessments across the EU. Furthermore, uniform disclosure improves data quality and strengthens market discipline. 	In order to ensure a transparent identification process and a level playing field, the proposed draft Guidelines foresee that not only G-SIIs, but also other large institutions with an overall exposure of more than EUR 200 billion Euro and which are potentially systemically relevant, will be subject to the same disclosure requirement. 	Consultation process 	Comments can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the ""send your comments"" button on the respective consultation pages. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 28 February 2014. 	All contributions received will be published following the close of the consultation, unless requested otherwise. 	Background 	In order to compensate for the higher risk that Global Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs) represent for the financial system and the impact that their potential failure may have on sovereign finance and taxpayers, the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) foresees that higher own funds requirements should be imposed on G-SIIs. 	The EBA developed these RTS on the basis of internationally agreed standards, such as the framework established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), as well as standards for assessing Global Systemically Important Banks and for higher loss absorbency requirements developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). What is more, in order to reduce the administrative burden for institutions, the identification of G-SIIs in the EU is synchronised with the BCBS process. This allows institutions to report the same data to both the BCBS and national authorities at Member States level. "
24043,EBA_PR_0523,2016-07-14,EBA notes progress in convergence of supervisory practices across the EU," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its second annual Report on the convergence of supervisory practices across the EU. The Report, which is addressed to the EU Parliament and the Council, reviews consistency in the application of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) and supervisory practices in the assessment of recovery plans. The EBA's work in supervisory convergence is designed to foster comparable approaches and consistent outcomes in applying the Single Rulebook. This is necessary for a level playing field, effective supervision of cross border groups, and to identify supervisory best practices.  	  	The Report highlights that supervisory authorities across the EU have made additional progress on convergence of supervisory practices, also thanks to the implementation of the EBA SREP Guidelines for the 2016 SREP cycle. In particular, the EBA notes the consistent structure of various SREPs and clear articulation of additional capital requirements, mirroring the composition of minimum own funds requirements. 	  	However, the report also identifies important differences, in particular in determining the amount of additional capital requirements and in the legal nature of such requirements. These, in combination with the application of automatic restrictions on distributions, risk different treatment of banks and investors in the Single Market. 	  	Common rules are vital for the effective functioning of the Single Market and consistency in supervisory risk assessments and outcomes play an important role in supporting the Single Rulebook, whilst maintaining the space for proportionality and supervisory judgement that is required for effective supervision. 	  	Notes to editors 	  	One of the EBA's key mandates is to develop ensure supervisory convergence and consistency of supervisory outcomes within the EU. In addition, Article 107 of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRDIV) includes a specific mandate for the EBA on consistency of supervisory reviews, evaluations and supervisory measures in Member States. This Article also requires the EBA to report to the EU Parliament and the Council on the degree of convergence of supervisory practices. 	  	Based on this mandate, the EBA has collected information and analysed relevant supervisory practices. It has also developed a number of Guidelines and Technical Standards and contributed to the promotion of convergence in supervision through its participation in Colleges of Supervisors of cross-border institutions, the development of a European Supervisory Handbook, the provision of dedicated training, and the performance of analytical and benchmarking activities. 	  "

23525,EBA_PR_0005,2020-02-17,EBA shows banks’ progress in planning for failure but encourages them to issue eligible debt instruments," Close to half of the relevant banks are already meeting their requirement yet the EBA Report estimates that 117 banks out of 222 exhibit an MREL shortfall reaching EUR 178 bnWeighted average MREL requirements range between 26.5% and 19%Bank should take advantage of positive market condition to close MREL shortfallsThe European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its first quantitative Report on minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) under a new methodology. The report shows that authorities have made strong progress in agreeing resolution strategies and setting related MREL requirements but it also notes that banks need to issue MREL eligible debt to close their shortfall.222 European banks representing 80% of total assets are covered by a resolution strategy other than liquidation. This is reflective of the fact that authorities have progressed since the introduction of BRRD in 2014 and the fact that the majority of European banking assets are held by large and complex banking groups for which liquidation is not deemed appropriate.On a weighted average basis, MREL requirements in the EU range between 26.5% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) for the global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) – the largest and most complex banks – and 19% of RWAs for the banks with total assets below EUR 1 billion that are neither G-SIIs nor other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs). Overall, MREL levels are reflective of banks’ going-concern requirements; in the case of transfer strategies, MREL levels also reflect the scaling down of MREL based on the transfer perimeter.105 banks out of 222 sample already meet their requirement while the rest reported an estimated MREL shortfall of EUR178bn. While this is significant, it is worth noting that 65 of those banks with shortfalls also report instruments totaling EUR67bn that are close in nature to MREL but not eligible. This shows that some banks already have a sophisticated investor base, likely to invest in long-term unsecured debt such as MREL eligible instruments.In the light of these shortfalls, the EBA encourages European resolution groups to take advantage of the current positive market conditions to issue and build up resources. As pointed out in the recent EBA risk assessment report, despite continued volatility, spreads for all market instrument have been on a downward trend for most of 2019, with spreads between secured and unsecured as well as between senior and subordinated instruments narrowing.Note to the editors  The Report is based on data provided by resolution authorities and covers the actual population of banks covered by an MREL decision, the actual level of this requirement and the level of resources effectively eligible in the relevant jurisdictions.The Report, which will be updated annually in line as mandate by BRRD Art 45l(1), is accompanied by a factsheet.

23209,EBA_NEWS_1211,2014-06-11,EBA informs on liquidity reporting templates," European Commission website The supervisory reporting templates, including those on liquidity, contained in the Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on supervisory reporting drafted by the European Banking Authority (EBA), adopted by the European Commission (EC) on 16 April 2014 and due to be published soon in the EU Official Journal, are a correct legal transposition of the relevant provisions laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).  However, following the adoption of these ITS, some additional technical issues have emerged relating to the mapping of the liquidity templates (Annex XII) onto the underlying data point model (Annex XIV).  These constitute only a small number of the many templates adopted as part of the ITS on supervisory reporting as adopted on 16th April. In order to provide a pragmatic solution to these issues, and to ensure an efficient and smooth reporting and processing of important liquidity data, DG MARKT services and the EBA have agreed that either the templates published on the Commission website on 16 April, or the relevant liquidity files published on the EBA website on 2 December 2013, can be used for the purposes of liquidity reporting in accordance with the EC implementing act. This is an exceptional measure given the specific circumstances of the situation and the urgent need to progress liquidity reporting. These issues will be resolved at the earliest opportunity and, at the latest, when the liquidity templates are reviewed following the entry into force of the pending delegated act on liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). "
24007,EBA_PR_0487,2016-10-11,EBA publishes final guidelines on corrections to modified duration for debt instruments," The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its final Guidelines on corrections to modified duration for debt instruments. The objective of these Guidelines is to establish what type of adjustments to the modified duration (MD) - as defined according to the formulas in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) - have to be performed in order to appropriately reflect the effect of the prepayment risk. The Guidelines will contribute towards the successful implementation of the Commission's securitisation package under the Capital Markets Union reform, giving clarity on the matter to credit institutions. 	  	The CRR establishes two standardised methods to compute capital requirements for general interest rate risk. One is the so-called maturity-based calculation for general interest risk, while the other one is the duration-based calculation of general risk. 	  	These final Guidelines are relevant for institutions applying the duration-based calculation, and establish two approaches to correct the modified duration calculation. The first approach treats the instrument with embedded optionality as if it were a combination of a plain vanilla bond and an option whilst the second approach proposes to calculate directly the change in value of the whole instrument subject to prepayment risk. The Guidelines also require to compute additional adjustments to reflect the negative convexity as well as transaction costs and, where relevant, behavioural factors that may affect the modified duration of the instrument. 	Legal basis  	The final Guidelines have been developed according to the last subparagraph of Article 340(3) of Regulation (EU) No575/2013 which mandates the EBA to develop Guidelines to specify how to apply corrections to the calculation of the modified duration to reflect prepayment risk.  	  	These Guidelines take into account the feedback received during the public consultation. 	  "
23283,EBA_PR_1285,2013-12-12,EBA warns consumers on virtual currencies," The European Banking Authority (EBA) issued today a warning on a series of risks deriving from buying, holding or trading virtual currencies such as Bitcoins. The EBA said that consumers are not protected through regulation when using virtual currencies as a means of payment and may be at risk of losing their money. It also added that there is no guarantee that currency values remain stable The warning was issued while the Authority assesses further all relevant aspects associated with virtual currencies, in order to identify whether virtual currencies can and should be regulated and supervised. 	According to the EBA, while virtual currencies continue to hit the headlines and are enjoying increasing popularity, consumers need to remain aware of the risks associated with them. In particular, consumers should be aware that exchange platforms tend to be unregulated and are not banks that hold their virtual currency as a deposit. Currently, no specific regulatory protections exist in the EU that would protect consumers from financial losses if a platform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or goes out of business. 	The EBA added that the ‘digital wallets' containing consumers' virtual currency stored on computers, laptops or smart phones, are not impervious to hackers. Cases have been reported of consumers losing significant amounts of virtual currency, with little prospect of having it returned. Also, when using virtual currency for commercial transactions, consumers are not protected by any refund rights under EU law. 	The EBA also reminded that as transactions in virtual currency provide a high degree of anonymity, they may be misused for criminal activities, including money laundering. This misuse could lead law enforcement agencies to close exchange platforms at short notice and prevent consumers from accessing or retrieving any funds that the platforms may be holding for them. 	Consumers should also remain mindful that holding virtual currencies may have tax implications, and should make sure that they give due consideration to whether tax liabilities apply in their country when using virtual currencies. 	The EBA recommended that, if consumers  buy virtual currencies,  they should fully understand their specific characteristics and not use ‘real' money that they cannot afford to lose. 	Background 	About virtual currencies 	A virtual currency is a form of unregulated digital money, not issued or guaranteed by a central bank, which can act as means of payment. Virtual currencies have come in many forms, beginning as currencies within online computer gaming environments and social networks, and developing into means of payment accepted ‘offline' or in ‘real life'. It is now increasingly possible to use virtual currencies as a means to pay for goods and services with retailers, restaurants and entertainment venues. These transactions often do not incur any fees or charges, and do not involve a bank. 	More recently, the virtual currency ‘Bitcoin' has set the scene for a new generation of decentralised, peer-to-peer virtual currencies - often also referred to as crypto-currencies. 	Virtual currencies can be bought at an exchange platform using conventional currency. They are then transferred to a personalised account known as a ‘digital wallet'. Using this wallet, consumers can send virtual currencies online to anyone else willing to accept them, or convert them back into a conventional fiat currency (such as the Euro, Pound or Dollar). 	About the EBA 	The European Banking Authority (EBA) is a regulatory agency of the European Union, it provides advice to EU institutions in the areas of banking, payments and e-money regulation, as well as on issues related to corporate governance, auditing and financial reporting. Its overall objectives are to maintain financial stability in the EU and to safeguard the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of the banking sector. 	The EBA also promotes a transparent, simple and fair internal market for EU consumers in financial products and services. The EBA seeks to foster consumer protection in financial services across the EU by identifying and addressing detriment consumers may experience, or are at risk of experiencing, in their dealings with financial firms. 	The EBA was established on 1 January 2011 as part of the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) and took over all existing responsibilities and tasks of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors. 	  "

Mr Garkov shared with the audience the importance of e-services for modern societies, economic development and growth. ""IT technologies and e-services based on these, are the main tools for modern societies to be efficient and successful. e-services are the neural system of today´s society"", emphasised Krum Garkov. He noted that Europe today is at the point of its economic and social development, where cross-border e-services are of extreme importance for its economic growth. He said that sustainable management and evolution of these EU e-services requires centralized management to accommodate the standardization, consolidation, scalability and interoperability of the services, in order for them to fulfil their full potential and purpose. ""An EU level entity with proven capabilities and expertise in managing EU IT systems, complemented with strong organizational practices in cyber security and data protection, would be the best option to maximize value for all stakeholders - citizens, businesses and Member States. eu-LISA is prepared to capitalize on the experience gathered to date and to develop its contribution in new policy domains. For this reason, the Agency is exploring the possibility to take on the responsibilities of operational management and evolution for the e-CODEX platform in 2018. With joint efforts by the Member States, EU institutions and eu-LISA, European e-services will soon deliver their benefits to Europe as a whole"" stated Krum Garkov. Meta Tags:   "

""Throughout the first weeks of operation, eu-LISA remained in close contact with Member States, providing detailed reports and online interactive assistance to the national teams. The Agency is very pleased to inform all involved stakeholders of the smooth start of operations of the Visa Information System in Russia, one of the countries with the largest number of visa holders travelling to the EU"" said Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA.The introduction of VIS in Russia follows the last roll-out that took place in September 2014 to the Western Balkans region and to Turkey. In May 2014 all Schengen State consulates in North America, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean and Australasia started to use VIS.VIS is a central database for the exchange of data on short-stay (up to three months) visas between authorities of Schengen States. The main objectives of VIS are to facilitate visa application procedures and checks at external border as well as to enhance security. In order to use VIS, applicants will be required to provide their biometric data (fingerprints and a digital photograph) when applying for a Schengen visa.  The collection of biometric data is a joint decision of the Schengen countries to better protect applicants against identity theft and prevent false identifications. Biometric data, along with the data provided in the Schengen visa application form, will be recorded in the VIS central database. The VIS central database is secure and data will be processed in accordance with the highest data protection standards of the EU.Exemptions from the fingerprinting requirement are provided for:children under the age of twelve;persons for whom the collection of fingerprints is physically impossible;Heads of State and members of the national Governments, with accompanying spouses, and the members of their official delegation when they are invited by Member States' governments or by international organisations for an official purpose.Everybody has the right to obtain communication of the data recorded in VIS related to him/her from the Schengen State which entered the data into the system. Any given person may also request that inaccurate data related to him/her be corrected and the data unlawfully recorded be deleted.Contact:info@eulisa.europa.eu Related Links:Factsheet on VISA Information System (VIS)​ Meta Tags: biometrics; Russia "
32400,EULISA_NEWS_0096,2020-02-19,Commission presents strategies for data and Artificial Intelligence," Page ContentToday, the Commission unveils its ideas and actions for a digital transformation that works for all, reflecting the best of Europe: open, fair, diverse, democratic and confident. It presents a European society powered by digital solutions that put people first, opens up new opportunities for businesses, and boosts the development of trustworthy technology to foster an open and democratic society and a vibrant and sustainable economy. Digital is a key enabler to fighting climate change and achieving the green transition. The European data strategy and the policy options to ensure the human-centric development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presented today are the first steps towards achieving these goals.The President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Today we are presenting our ambition to shape Europe's digital future. It covers everything from cybersecurity to critical infrastructures, digital education to skills, democracy to media. I want that digital Europe reflects the best of Europe – open, fair, diverse, democratic, and confident.”Europe as a leader in trustworthy Artificial IntelligenceEurope has all it needs to become a world leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that can be safely used and applied. We have excellent research centres, secure digital systems and a robust position in robotics as well as competitive manufacturing and services sectors, spanning from automotive to energy, from healthcare to agriculture. In its White Paper presented today, the Commission envisages a framework for trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, based on excellence and trust. In partnership with the private and the public sector, the aim is to mobilise resources along the entire value chain and to create the right incentives to accelerate deployment of AI, including by smaller and medium-sized enterprises. This includes working with Member States and the research community, to attract and keep talent. As AI systems can be complex and bear significant risks in certain contexts, building trust is essential. Clear rules need to address high-risk AI systems without putting too much burden on less risky ones. Strict EU rules for consumer protection, to address unfair commercial practices and to protect personal data and privacy, continue to apply.For high-risk cases, such as in health, policing, or transport, AI systems should be transparent, traceable and guarantee human oversight. Authorities should be able to test and certify the data used by algorithms as they check cosmetics, cars or toys. Unbiased data is needed to train high-risk systems to perform properly, and to ensure respect of fundamental rights, in particular non-discrimination. While today, the use of facial recognition for remote biometric identification is generally prohibited and can only be used in exceptional, duly justified and proportionate cases, subject to safeguards and based of EU or national law, the Commission wants to launch a broad debate about which circumstances, if any, might justify such exceptions.Read the full Press Release here:Shaping Europe's digital future: Commission presents strategies for data and Artificial Intelligence Meta Tags:   "

Speaking at the launch, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker declared, ‘with the European Pillar of Social Rights, the EU stands up for the rights of its citizens in a fast-changing world.’ Stepping into the spacious, contemporary surroundings of the Eriksbergshallen conference centre in Gothenburg, Sweden, you could be forgiven for overlooking the building’s history as a hub of the ship-building and metal-working industries that once provided the core of PthRAeCcTitICy’Es AeRmEpAlSoymPReOntJ.ETCoTdSa&y,CEArMikPsAbIeGrNgSshaRllEeGnIOstNaSn&dsCOamUNidTsRtIEaSregenerated waterfront district that boasts technology start-up companies, high-concept apartments, artisan bars PaUnBdLrICeAstTaIOuNraSn&tsR, EpSrOimUaRrCyEaSndNsEeWcoSnRdOaOrMy s&cEhVoEoNlsT, Sa voAcBaOtUioTnal college, and the Lindholmen Knowledge Centre – a former warehouse converted into a high-tech learning centre. Suring the wave of change It is the embodiment of a successful transformation from industrial to the knowledge economy, built on the principles of lifelong learning and social cohesion. It offers a glimpse of what is possible when the rapid pace of social and economic change is seen more for its potential than its threat. Nowhere is the pace of that change more keenly felt than in the interface between the labour market and education and training systems. New modes of employment, disruptive business models, rapidly increasing automation, and the emergence of novel industrial sectors all demand new skills and ever-greater fexibility from those seeking to enter or re- enter the labour market. While many education and training systems struggle to keep pace, the evidence, from Gothenburg and elsewhere, shows that innovative practices, modernised infrastructure, and enabling policies can inspire and empower national and regional systems, as well as individuals, to turn uncertainty into opportunity. People irst This message came through clearly in the 2016-2017 round of the ETF’s Torino Process. The conclusions of Changing Skills for a Changing World, the Torino Process international conference held in June 2017, highlighted system change, expanding access to skills, promoting innovation, and building trust to increase efficiency and effectiveness as key areas, along with ‘focusing on people, people, and people.’ Failure to do so attracts considerable dangers. There is a growing feeling, around the world, that people’s basic rights have been sidelined in the focus on economic growth following the financial crash of 2008. Maintaining the balance of human and economistic development is vital for the success of the social market economy on which European integration is based. Meanwhile, a political narrative developed in which ‘global elites’ were portrayed as having captured most of the benefits of globalisation and digitalisation. The resentment generated by this narrative provides fertile ground for extremist elements to exploit. A response to this was the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth, held in the Eriksbergshallen, at which the European Pillar of Social Rights was unveiled. Introducing the Summit, the host of the event, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, announced: ‘We are here to put people first for a social Europe.’ A solid foundation The European Pillar of Social Rights enshrines 20 principles and rights covering equal opportunities and access to the labour market, fair working conditions, and social protection and inclusion. It is significant that its very first principle is: P‘ERvAeCrTyIoCEneARhEaAsSthePrRiOgJhEtCtToSq&uCaAliMtyPAaInGdNSinclRuEsGivIOeNeSd&ucCaOtUioNnT,RtIrEaSining and life-long learning in order to maintain and acquire skills that enable them to participate fully in PsUoBcLieICtyATaInOdNSm&aRnEaSgOeUsRuCcEcSessNfuEWllySRtrOaOnMsit&ioEnVsENinTStheAlaBbOoUuTr market.’ The ability to ‘participate fully in society’ comes first, and necessarily includes access to meaningful and productive work – whether that comes through employment, self- employment, entrepreneurship, volunteering, or other forms of value creation. Successfully managing transitions in the labour market covers everything from school leavers seeking a start in the world of work, to people returning from caring responsibilities, and the potential for older workers to find new roles. Playing catch-up is not an option for policymakers. A proactive approach is vital, if the benefits of fair employment and equitable education and training opportunities are to be shared across populations. With the European Pillar of Social Rights, the EU Member States demonstrate their commitment to fairer labour markets, sustainable social protection systems, and well- functioning social dialogue. The ETF’s partner countries share these aims, and the ETF is determined to do its best to support them. As Marianne Thyssen, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility put it, the Social Summit sent ‘a strong message of unity, hope and action to European citizens.’ Together, we will spread this message to citizens throughout the EU neighbourhood, and beyond.

Supporting teachers so that they are up-to-date with the latest professional developments, guaranteeing students the appropriate facilities and tools to get ready for the labour market, maintaining close cooperation with entrepreneurs to assess the companies’ needs – all this is key to making vocational training a real fast-track from school to work. In order to make high-quality standard in the EU neighbouring countries, the European Training Foundation today launched the irst ETF Forum for quality assurance in vocational education and training. The Forum is all about bringing national institutions together with ETF, EU and international experts to improve quality assurance in vocational education and training. The countries involved so far range from Serbia to Turkey, from Algeria to Jordan. As the ETF Director, Cesare Onestini, said: “Everyone should have the opportunity to develop their skills to their full potential. That’s why access to high-quality training options is essential. Ensuring quality is a task that requires constant efforts in particular to modernise vocational education and keeping up with fast-changing labour markets. Transnational cooperation can help in this process by providing a forum to exchange ideas, get inspiration and speed up reforms. The ETF is happy to support these efforts in our partner countries.” Deining ‘quality’ and making it concrete is not easy: it requires a strong methodology and shared standards, to make sure that every citizen in every country can develop their potential and succeed in the labour market. The members of the Forum will engage in a wide range of activities to make this happen – from information gathering and analyses to vocational education and training system monitoring and evaluation. Besides face-to-face contacts, a dedicated e-platform is there to foster on-line collaboration. “This Forum is a great opportunity to share experience and learn from each other”, said Samer Hussein, Ministry of Education and Higher Education, Palestine [2]. The launch of the Forum is part of the EU Vocational Skills Week, a series of event organised all over Europe to improve the attractiveness and image of vocational education and training. Background The Forum for quality assurance in vocational education and training is attended by representatives from Ministries and major National institutions from Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Israel, Jordan, Kosovo[1], Lebanon, Montenegro, Palestine[2], Serbia and Turkey.

32788,CDT_NEWS_0021,2020-04-30,COVID-19 multilingual terminology available in IATE," Over the past few weeks, terminologists from the different translation services of the EU institutions have redoubled their efforts to enrich the interinstitutional terminology database IATE with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 related concepts. Currently, 270 entries, with 9 020 terms in 24 EU languages, have been compiled on the pandemic (data as of 29/04/2020). The leading entry is, as would be expected, ‘COVID-19’, and it can be found at this address: https://iate.europa.eu/entry/result/3588486/all. To enable IATE users to access these 270 entries in one go, an Excel spreadsheet listing all the terms has been produced (see below). The URLs in the second column point to the relevant multilingual entry in the IATE database, some of which are still being updated by terminologists. Users can search in IATE by ID or term, or click directly on the entry link to have a detailed view of a specific concept with all the available metadata (definitions, notes, contexts, etc.). IATE users now benefit from coverage of the topic in their own languages, and this will continue to grow and develop in parallel with requirements. Users have access to accurate and harmonised multilingual content, which will assist them in their work, often completed under very tight deadlines. The database receives an average of 45 million queries per year, which clearly demonstrates its role as a very popular and useful tool for many people. In these difficult times, everyone is doing their best, within their remit, to deal with the coronavirus crisis. EU terminologists therefore hope that IATE users will find this new collection of terms useful.   Useful links The IATE terminology collection around COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 (Excel spreadsheet) Warning: please note that this Excel file is a screenshot of the pandemic-related content available in IATE taken on 29 April 2020. The database is continuously being updated by EU terminologists, and remains the reference source of choice.

21013,FRA_NEWS_0972,2017-09-14,"Conference focuses on women’s rights, religion and refugees",It also highlighted the issue of gender-based violence towards female refugees. The conference gathered representatives of local and city governments from several European countries in Vienna on 6 and 7 September to discuss the role of women’s rights and religion in relation to refugees during different phases of integration. 
20996,FRA_NEWS_0955,2017-10-06,Data protection and privacy commissioners worldwide explore common concerns,"During the event data protection and privacy regulators, as well as frontline witnesses, discussed what privacy means in their countries, taking into account specificities such as ethics, society, religion, the expectations and attitudes towards men, women and children, as well as the use of technology."
20970,FRA_NEWS_0929,2017-10-18,Violence against women still all too common,"In 2014 the survey exposed the pervasive nature of violence against women: 33% of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence. 55% of women have been sexually harassed 20% of young women have been harassed online. 22% have experienced physical / sexual violence by a partner. 32% of victims were sexually harassed by a boss, colleague or customer. These figures and later surveys have shown that perpetrators are found across the social and political spectrum. Most are men. They operate in all areas of life and it happens online just as much as it does offline. The EU and its Member States are committed to combating violence against women. There is a legal framework in place to help safeguard the rights and dignity of women and girls. Most recently, the EU itself signed the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence in June 2017, which all EU Member States have signed and 15 Member States have ratified. However, much still remains to be done to realise gender equality and to enable women and girls live in an environment free of gender-based violence and misogyny. The European Commission’s 2017 Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights in November will focus on women's rights. It will also discuss the link between misogyny in society and the violation of women’s fundamental rights, the subject of a paper that FRA drafted for the event. The paper outlines fresh evidence of the different forms of prejudice, contempt or hatred towards women and girls in Member States and suggests possible ways forward to promote gender equality and to fight against all forms of such violence. This evidence will point to the urgent need for the EU and Member States to take decisive action, many examples of which can also be found in FRA’s survey findings report, to help ensure women and girls can fully enjoy their rights to life, liberty and security, to education, work and housing and to participate in public life. Only then can we ensure that women and girls live free from violence in a society that treats them with full equality."
20140,FRA_PR_0145,2010-10-27,Media release: Does discrimination foster violence?,"FRA Director Morten Kjaerum: ""Young people who are discriminated against and feel socially marginalised, and those who have been a victim of violence are more likely to use violence towards others. This pattern holds true for both Muslim and non-Muslim youth. However, Muslim youth in our survey reported having experienced more discrimination and social marginalisation than non-Muslim youth. In order to tackle some of the root causes of violence, it is important to ensure that children are not exposed themselves to violence and discrimination."" On average, 1 out of 4 young people reported that they had been unfairly treated or picked on. Muslim youths were significantly more likely than non-Muslims to say that this had happened to them in France and Spain; in the United Kingdom there was no difference between responses for Muslim and non-Muslim youth. Figure 1: Experience of being unfairly picked on (%) Many of the young people surveyed have experienced violence (ranging from bullying and other forms of emotional violence to more physical forms of aggression). It was also found that there is a strong link between being a victim and being an offender. In all three Member States surveyed, young people who felt socially marginalised, and those who had been a victim of violence because of their cultural or religious background, skin colour or language, were more likely to use emotional violence (such as teasing or bullying) towards others than young people who did not feel socially marginalised or those who had not been victimised for the above-mentioned reasons. Overall, there is a low acceptance of violence among young people, and there is no direct link between attitudes supporting violence and actual engagement in violence. Experience of Discrimination, Social Marginalisation and Violence: a comparative study of Muslim and non-Muslim Youth in three EU Member States This report presents the findings of a research study conducted by the FRA during 2008-2009 in France, Spain and the United Kingdom. 1,000 young people between the ages of 12 and 18 in each of the three Member States were surveyed - in total, 3,000 young people took part in the survey. The survey focused on three EU Member States that have experienced terrorist attacks associated with radical Islam or urban unrest related to immigrant youth with a predominantly Muslim background. The research set out to explore the experiences and attitudes of both Muslim and non-Muslim young people in these countries with a view to providing results that are of use to those formulating policies to address discrimination, social marginalisation and integration.  The FRA survey set out to explore possible relationships between young people's experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation, including experiences of racism, and their attitudes towards and actual engagement in violent behaviours.

The panel was composed of the European Commissioner for Security, the EU anti-terrorist coordinator and the European Data Protection Supervisor. He underlined that interoperability is not intrinsically a fundamental rights violation but requires adequate safeguards and mechanisms to ensure the rights set out in the EU's Fundamental Rights Charter are upheld without exception for everyone entering and residing in the EU. He underlined that is vital that when designing interoperable information systems that there is full respect for core principles of data protection. In addition, interoperable systems should include an additional focus on child protection and the effective recording of missing children. He was drawing on the findings a draft paper that FRA will publish early July."
21118,FRA_NEWS_1077,2017-05-03,"Protect press freedom to protect democracy and our rights, says FRA","“A free and critical press are the hallmarks of a vibrant democracy. They investigate, challenge and alert us to rights abuses,” says FRA Director Michael O’Flaherty. “Journalism in the EU is under threat and every effort must be made to protect the media from undue pressure and harassment as providers of reliable and trustworthy news.” The EU is founded on the values democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Central to this is a free and pluralistic media, as enshrined in the EU’s Fundamental Rights Charter. However, a FRA study has identified worrying signs of intrusions into press freedom such as intimidation, threats, and even violence. This has led some media outlets to close and some journalists to self-censor out of fear. Women journalists in particular are often targeted because of their gender. They are also face more online harassment and threats than their male counterparts. In addition, state security is often used to justify surveillance of journalists. For example, in one EU Member State, a pre-trial investigation revealed that a district judge court authorised the secret services to tap 17 journalists to find the source of a leaked government report. Clearly, the EU, its Member States and civil society need to help ensure freedom of the press is adequately protected from interference and journalists, and publishers and editors are safe from attack. In this way their vital contribution to democracy, justice and human rights can continue."

This included the work of the EMN Return Expert Group, particularly on asylum migration and integration and its integrated return management application. FRA also spoke about its research into the long term impact of responses to the 2015 asylum/migration crisis. The contribution was well received and the wish for continuous cooperation with the EMN and FRA was expressed from both sides. "

Representatives from European courts and other institutions also participated to explore problems and possible solutions with practitioners."
20020,FRA_PR_0025,2018-11-28,"Being black in the EU often means racism, poor housing and poor jobs","“In the 21st century, there is no excuse for racial discrimination. Yet black people in the EU today are still victims of widespread and unacceptable levels of discrimination and harassment simply because of their skin colour,” says FRA Director Michael O’Flaherty. “We need to stamp this out once and for all. For this, Member States need effective and targeted policies and laws to ensure black people are fully included in our society.” The Being Black in the EU report reveals the many challenges black people face. Take racial harassment: 30% of respondents say they have been racially harassed in the last five years; 5% have been physically attacked. Member States should therefore make greater efforts to better support victims of racism and to properly prosecute perpetrators. Racial discrimination also remains problematic. Around a quarter of black people experienced racial discrimination at work or when looking for work. Young black people are especially vulnerable; in some countries, up to 76% are not in work, education or training compared to 8% of the general population. Member States should therefore develop targeted measures to counter such discrimination. This could include diversity audits in workplaces and public sector recruitment drives among black people. Housing is another issue: 14% of respondents say private landlords will not rent accommodation to them. This is especially problematic, as only 15% own property, as opposed to 70% of the EU’s general population. In addition, 45% live in overcrowded housing compared to 17% of the general population, pointing to the need for Member States to improve the quality of housing and to eradicate housing exclusion. Discriminatory profiling in police stops is also an issue: 24% of respondents were stopped by the police in the last five years. Among those stopped, 41% felt the stop constituted racial profiling, which undermines trust in policing and community relations. To counter this, Member States should develop specific, practical guidance for police officers so they can avoid unlawful profiling – FRA’s will publish a guide on how to avoid unlawful profiling on 5 December. Guidance on community policing would also help. This report examines the experiences of nearly 6,000 black people in 12 EU Member States, as part of FRA’s 2nd EU Minorities and Discrimination survey. It collected information from over 25,500 people with an immigrant or ethnic minority background, including Roma and Russians, in all 28 EU Member States. It builds on FRA’s first such survey from 2008. For more please contact: media@fra.europa.eu / Tel.: +43 1 580 30 642"

The activities and required resources defined in the Programming Document serve as the necessary means to further strengthen EFCA's capacity in achieving its mission and tasks. It also implements the Administrative Board's recommendations drawn up by the second five-year evaluation for the years 2012-2017 that confirmed EFCA’s added value to the overall achievement of the Common Fisheries Policy, for an enhanced culture of compliance leading to more sustainable practices for the environment in the long-term. The Programming Document confirms that the core mission of the Agency will continue to be enshrined in the coordination of Member States' control and inspection activities. This includes assisting them in the implementation of joint deployment plans (JDP), as well as developing harmonised and cost-effective methodologies for fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance. Moreover, the delivery of EFCA's new tasks in the framework of the Coast Guard function, including fostering collaboration with both FRONTEX and EMSA, will remain high on the Agency's agenda. EFCA's active participation in multipurpose operations with those agencies will translate into a direct contribution to the Union fisheries control regime, as well as the fight against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing. EFCA's innovative contributions beyond EU borders will become even more apparent in the coming months with the full implementation of the cooperation project – PESCAO – with the purpose of increasing fisheries control activities through capacity building and trainings in West Africa, as well as with the follow-up actions to the pilot project for coordinating control activities in the Mediterranean in the context of GFCM. “As a result, EFCA's work programme for 2018 will build upon its proven expertise in coordinating fisheries control as well as training and capacity building activities, thus contributing to a uniform and effective implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, including in its external dimension,” said Pascal Savouret, Executive Director."

19416,EMCDDA_UNK_0081,2020-05-12,COVID-19: New EMCDDA study highlights drop in availability of drug services in Europe but increase in innovation ," As Europe grapples with the unprecedented public health threat posed by COVID-19, how is the outbreak affecting drug users and service providers? In a new study published today — Impact of COVID-19 on drug services and help-seeking in Europe — the EMCDDA reports signs of a drop in the availability of drug services during the pandemic and in the numbers of those seeking help. But the study also provides insight into how services have adapted and innovated during the fast-changing crisis in ways that could be carried forward into the future. The report is the first in a series of briefings resulting from an EMCDDA ‘trendspotter’ study, launched in April to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the drug situation and responses to it. The agency’s trendspotter methodology explores emerging drug-related trends by rapidly collecting and triangulating data from a variety of sources to allow for timely assessments of topics of concern. Due to national emergency restrictions, the method was adapted to suit online investigation and the study designed to be carried out in successive waves (1). The findings released today stem from the first wave of the investigation which focused on drug services. Results highlight that COVID-19 and national lockdowns have led to reduced availability and provision of treatment and harm-reduction services in most European countries. Emerging evidence suggests that, like other healthcare providers, drug services are facing a range of challenges including: staffing shortages; access to personal protective equipment; and managing infected clients and staff vulnerability to infection. Preliminary findings from the study show that drug services are adapting and innovating during COVID-19, with similar characteristics reported across Europe. With face-to-face counselling curtailed during containment, telemedicine by phone or video has been embraced as an alternative across European drug services. Providers of opioid substitution treatment (OST) have also acted rapidly to change the way in which they provide medication (e.g. mobile OST) and respond to new treatment demands (e.g. new induction procedures), while most countries have relaxed regulations on take-home OST for stable patients (e.g. prescribing for larger quantities or longer periods). Harm-reduction services have also been swift to adapt, playing a key role in providing frontline support during the crisis. This includes: increasing outreach work and needle- and syringe-exchange activities; providing shelter management for homeless and marginalised groups; maintaining drug consumption room services (in situ or mobile) and moving some interventions online (e.g. drug checking). The briefing presents a snapshot of how the demand for specialised treatment evolved between January 2020 and March 2020, providing a first insight on the impact of COVID-19 on help-seeking behaviour. Data show that there was some drop in demand for treatment services during this period for reasons including closure or restricted access to treatment centres and clients’ inability to reach centres due to confinement measures. But this was partially compensated by remote technology and modified interventions. When questioned on the ‘new normal’ for drug services in Europe post-COVID-19, many of the experts surveyed were in favour of maintaining some of the service changes rapidly introduced in recent months. The use of telemedicine was the most cited example, being seen as a useful complement to face-to-face services in the future. Coordination between public, private and non-governmental actors during the crisis was also welcomed by respondents and seen as particularly beneficial for services users. As confinement procedures are eased, drug services will be expected to maintain a broad range of health protection measures, adapt their routines and reinforce contingency planning in case of a second wave. Negative economic forecasts for national economies raise particular concerns over potential budget cuts for drug services and greater marginalisation of certain social groups. Nevertheless, many survey respondents remained hopeful that the innovation and collaboration seen in recent months would remain positive features of drug services in Europe in the foreseeable future.

Laura d’Arrigo (France), Diplomatic advisor at the French Interministerial Mission for Combating Drugs and Addictive Behaviours (Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les drogues et les conduites addictives — MILDECA) was re-elected Chair for the next three years. Ms d’Arrigo has been member of the Board since December 2013 and is the first woman to hold the position. After several years working for the EU institutions, in particular the European Commission, Ms d’Arrigo was entrusted by the French authorities in 2007 to contribute to implementing and coordinating French foreign policy in the drugs field, both at bilateral and multilateral level. Between 2010 and 2014, she chaired the Permanent Correspondents of the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe. Franz Pietsch (Austria) was re-elected to the position of Vice-Chair today. Mr Pietsch, who has been a member of the Board since 2002, is representative of Austria regarding international matters of addiction and drug issues and is Deputy Director-General and Head of Department for Tobacco, Alcohol, Non-substance-related Addictions and International Affairs of Addiction. Commenting on the results, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘I congratulate the Chair and Vice-Chair on their re-election and thank them for their hard work and cooperation throughout their first mandate. I look forward to working with them in accomplishing the EMCDDA Strategy 2025 and work programme for 2019–21 and, together, contributing to a healthier and more secure Europe‘. Claude Gillard (Belgium), founding member of the agency, was also re-elected today as member and Chair of the EMCDDA Budget Committee. Mr Gillard has chaired the committee since 2003. Lars Petersen (Denmark) was elected as member of the Executive Committee. The Management Board is the EMCDDA’s main decision-making body and meets twice a year. It consists of one representative from each EU Member State, Turkey and Norway, two European Commission representatives and two independent experts in the drugs field designated by the European Parliament. At its meeting in Lisbon this week (13–14 December), the Board gave its final seal of approval on the agency’s 2019 budget and work programme 2019–21. Discussions also covered cooperation between the agency and Albania and Ukraine and procedures for establishing a list of experts to assist the EMCDDA Scientific Committee in risk assessments of new psychoactive substances. A call for expression of interest will be launched on the agency’s website in Spring 2019. Finally, the Board discussed the key conclusions of an external evaluation of the EMCDDA and recent developments in cannabis policies. "

19510,EMCDDA_UNK_0175,2018-07-04,Uruguay reports on regulated cannabis growing and sales," In Uruguay, the Institute for Regulation and Control of Cannabis (IRCCA) released a report on the national regulated market, based on data up to 5 June 2018. After the market was legalised in 2013, resident users could register for only one of three ways to obtain cannabis: home growing, communal growing (social club), or buying state-grown cannabis from pharmacies (which only started to sell the drug in July 2017). Cannabis sold in pharmacies initially had a potency of 2.5 % THC and 6-7 % CBD, though this changed in December 2017 to 9 % THC and 3 % CBD. It is sold in 5-gram sachets for UY$200 [EUR 5.80], and users may buy 40 grams per month. As of June 2018, some 958 kilograms of cannabis had been sold in this way. Who is buying? Uruguay has a population of 3.5 million. The report shows that 35 246 people are registered to obtain cannabis; 8 583 by home growing, 24 324 for pharmacy purchases and 2 339 as members of 91 clubs (averaging 26 members per club). About three-quarters (18 981, or 78 %) of those registered for pharmacy purchase have actually made purchases. Comparing these numbers to a 2014 population survey of cannabis use, it is estimated that 24 % of those who had used the drug in the previous year in Uruguay get their cannabis from the legal market. However, IRCCA estimates that each home-grower and club member shares with two other users, and each pharmacy buyer shares with one, and in this way the policy reaches some 55 % of the users in the country. Males account for 73 % of the pharmacy purchasers and 76 % of the home-growers. Around 80 % of those registered for home grow or pharmacy purchases are aged between 18 and 44, with home-growers slightly older on average. Around two-thirds of those registered for pharmacy purchase are in employment. Is cannabis available everywhere? Eight out of 19 regions in the country have pharmacies selling cannabis. The region of the capital city, Montevideo, accounted for 57 % of the registrations for cannabis sold in pharmacies, as well as 45 % of the clubs, but only 32 % of the home-growers.

2467,EIGE_NEWS_0076,2017-05-15,Tackling violence requires more comparable data,"Violence against women is happening in all corners of the EU but we still do not know its full extent. More reliable and comparable data are urgently needed to ensure that policy responses to violence are as effective as possible. EIGE’s new project on improving administrative data takes the Institute’s previous work on the topic one step further. It aims to improve the availability, quality and comparability of data collected by police and justice services on intimate partner violence and rape. Administrative data shed light on cases of violence that might otherwise go undetected. “If a woman goes to the police to report that she has been raped, the crime should be registered. Then if the matter goes to court, the justice system should also record the case and the outcome. These types of records are what we call administrative data. They provide a better understanding of the demand for services by victims, the response by police and justice and the effectiveness of prevention and protection measures”, explained Barbora Holubova, gender-based violence researcher at EIGE. All EU countries collect administrative data but to varying extents and in different ways. For this reason, important information is often missing, such as the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, which is crucial to identify cases of intimate partner violence. In addition, definitions of violence are different in each country, making it difficult to compare data across the EU. For example, only five Member States refer to intimate partner violence when describing violence between partners. In 10 Member States, the word ‘domestic violence’ is used and the term ‘family violence or ‘violence in the family’ is used in another 12 Member States. Furthermore, this information is often collected in different ways. For example, some administrative data sources count only solved cases (Sweden), while others count each incident (Germany). More reporting of violence would lead to increased reliability of information. “Many women do not come forward to report violence because there is still a lot of stigma and social acceptance around it. Sometimes victims are blamed for the violence and some might not yet have established trust in the police and justice” said Barbora Holubova. Currently, EIGE is organising meetings with all Member States and national authorities responsible for data collection on violence against women. After discussing gaps and challenges, EIGE will propose country-specific recommendations that take into account the legal context of each country. The recommendations aim to improve and harmonise data collection methods and assist countries with their regular reporting duties, for example to Eurostat, and for reporting requirements under the Victims’ Rights Directive and the Istanbul Convention. Ultimately, they will support EU efforts to eradicate violence against women.

2556,EIGE_NEWS_0165,2012-05-09,The Seimas discussed relevant matters of equal opportunities for women and men,"The priorities of the National Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men 2010-2014, the Information Portal and Electronic Network for Women, the activities of the European Institute for Gender Equality, as well as the Lithuanian version of the website of the Institute were presented today on 8 May at the European Information Office of the Seimas during an event organised by the Ministry of Social Security and Labour and the European Institute for Gender Equality. The audience was greeted by the Minister of Social Security and Labour Donatas Jankauskas, and by the Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality Virginija Langbakk. 'Women and men are equivalent components of our society. It is only natural and socially right that in all areas of life they are granted equal rights and opportunities, that the status of both women and men is equal, and that the potential of both women and men is used for the growth of the national economy as well as the wellbeing of society in an efficient and equal manner', - said Minister Jankauskas. The Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men 2010-2014was presented by the vice-minister of the Ministry of Social Security and Labour and the Chairman of the Commission of Equal Opportunities for Women and Men Prof. Audrius Bitinas. 'Lithuania was the first country in Eastern and Central Europe in 1998 to pass a Law on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men, ensuring equal rights de jure and binding all state and municipal institutions to perform programmes and measures aimed at ensuring equal opportunities for women and men de facto. Consistent and systematic work implementing the National Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men has resulted in Lithuania exceeding the EU average in terms of most of the indicators of gender equality', – stated Vice-minister Bitinas. The targets of the National Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men 2010-2014 are to ensure that the provisions of the Law on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men are implemented in a consistent, complex, and methodical manner in all areas, as well as to ensure that European Union and international obligations are implemented in the field of equality of women and men. The plan for the implementation means of the programme was approved in order to achieve these targets. The upgrading and updating of the Information Portal and Electronic Network for Women, administered by the Women’s Information Center, was supported in pursuance of the tasks of the aforementioned Programme. Implementation of this measure enabled better dissemination of information on the equality of women and men and also made more opportunities available for wider cooperation on gender equality issues. As part of the implementation of the Programme, in 2011 the European Institute for Gender Equality was able to launch the Lithuanian version of its web page, and in 2012 – to make it public and update the same. Today’s event is also dedicated to ensuring the visibility of the Institute in Lithuania. The Information Portal and Electronic Network for Women was presented by the project manager of the Women’s Information Centre Kamilė Butkevičiūtė, the Lithuanian version of the European Institute for Gender Equality web page – by chief investigator of the Institute Jolanta Reingardė, and the activities of the Institute – by the director of the Institute Virginija Langbakk. 'Accessibility of information in the native language can substantially increase the possibilities for encouraging the equality of women and men. I think that not only organisations, but also individuals, will take advantage of this unique opportunity to find out more about new changes in the field of equality of women and men. Such initiatives of the European Union Member States are very welcome', said the Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality Virginija Langbakk."
2441,EIGE_NEWS_0050,2018-10-17,Trafficking for sexual exploitation: a gendered crime,"Trafficking for sexual exploitation is the most commonly reported form of human trafficking in the European Union. It is a form of gender-based violence that disproportionately affects women. 95% of registered victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation in the EU are women or girls. Trafficking in women and girls remains a structural form of violence against women. Member States are obliged by law to take gender specific measures to assist and protect victims. In the lead up to the EU Anti-Trafficking day on 18 October, the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has published a report on the matter. “Our research shows that trafficking for sexual exploitation is rooted in gender inequalities. Anti-trafficking efforts cannot and must not overlook the gender-specific roots of this crime, which make women and girls more vulnerable to trafficking,” said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE’s director. “Women and girls make up the majority of reported victims of trafficking and continue to be disproportionately affected. This report forms part of a new set of priority actions presented by the Commission in December 2017, and reflects the commitments agreed in the Joint Statement signed by the Heads of ten EU Agencies last June. I believe it will help the many women and girls who have suffered unfathomably at the hands of traffickers and abusers. It will also help Member States translate into action their legal obligations to adopt gender-specific measures which take into account the form of exploitation victims have been subjected to,” said the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator Myria Vassiliadou. Victims of trafficking hold the right to assistance, support and protection. EIGE has analysed both the EU Anti-Trafficking Directive and the Victims’ Rights Directive from a gender perspective. The Institute, in cooperation with the European Commission, has developed gender and child specific recommendations to help Member States implement the directives and monitor their progress. Both directives need to be implemented in complementarity in order to maximise their potential to protect. National strategies to address trafficking for sexual exploitation should also be included in a broader national strategy to combat gender-based violence.

11067,EASA_NEWS_0351,2015-07-09,EASA consults on simpler rules for aircraft maintenance in General Aviation (Part-M Light)," The objective to make maintenance rules for General Aviation simpler and lighter is coming a step closer to reality. Today the Agency’s Part-M Light proposal was put forward for consultation, a significant milestone in the process. The objective is to have proportional aircraft maintenance rules applicable to the lighter end of the General Aviation activities. This ‘Notice of Proposed Amendment’ to the rules (NPA) is part of the Agency’s activities within the General Aviation Road Map to create simpler lighter and better regulations for the General Aviation community. You can read the NPA and use the comment response tool here. "
10976,EASA_NEWS_0260,2016-11-09,Easier access of GA pilots to Instrument Flying Rules (IFR) rating," The NPA was published in November 2016 and proposes the introduction of a ‘Basic Instrument Rating (BIR)’, which is a qualification to fly in Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), but based on more proportionate requirements when compared to the traditional instrument rating, and tailored to the need of GA pilots. "
11168,EASA_NEWS_0452,2012-04-11,Commission Regulation (EU) No 290/2012," Commission Regulation (EU) No 290/2012 of 30 March 2012 has been published in the Official Journal. It is amending Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 laying down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to civil aviation aircrew. It contains the additional three annexes of the aircrew regulation covering the qualification of cabin crew, the authority requirements and the organisation requirements for aircrew. The Agency intends to publish the corresponding Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) and Guidance Material (GM) in the coming weeks. "
11276,EASA_PR_0050,2017-04-05,EASA issues safety recommendations for the transport of Portable Electronic Devices containing lithium batteries," The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued today a Safety Information Bulletin to remind airlines and aircraft operators of important principles for the safe transport of Portable Electronic Devices (PEDs) containing lithium batteries. These principles should be taken into account by the airlines when they perform their safety risk assessment. PEDs containing lithium batteries are considered as dangerous goods. When carried by passengers, they should preferably be carried in the passenger cabin. This would enable the crew to react quickly in case an incident involving such PED occurs. When the carriage of PEDs in the cabin is not allowed, it leads to a significant increase of the number of PEDs in the cargo compartment. Certain precautions should therefore be observed to mitigate the risk of accidental fire in the cargo hold. In particular, PEDs placed in checked baggage must be completely switched off and well protected from accidental activation. “Passengers and crews safety is our highest priority. Spontaneous ignition or thermal runaway of Lithium batteries present safety risks which need to be taken into account. We must take all precautions to make sure that mitigating one risk does not lead to another risk” said Patrick Ky, EASA’s Executive Director. EASA Safety Information Bulletin 2017-04 "
11320,EASA_PR_0095,2012-11-26,EASA publishes new simplified rules for Third Country Operators in the European Union," The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) today published a proposal to establish a single system for the safety approval of Third Country Operators (TCO) operating into, within or out of the European Union (EU). Released in a document known as an Opinion, the proposed rules have been subject to two rounds public consultation in 2011 and 2012 fully involving all concerned stakeholders. Opinion 05/2012 aims to enhance safety of third country operators by ensuring continuous compliance with standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Replacing the various national systems existing today, the authorisation process is to be harmonised and streamlined through a single, proportionate and risk-based assessment process. The Opinion will lessen the administrative burden currently faced by both operators from outside Europe and National Aviation Authorities in the EU. The EASA Opinion will now enter the legislative process. It will be finalised by European Commission assisted by National Authorities under Parliamentary scrutiny. The new rules are expected to be adopted into EU law after mid-2013 and fully implemented by the end of 2015. "
11077,EASA_NEWS_0361,2015-04-08,Dangerous Goods in General Aviation," The GA safety strategy demands a more proportionate regulatory framework for the operation of General Aviation sector in Europe. In this context, the GA community came together in 2013 to identify issues that have a significant impact on their activity. They established a common list known as the ‘GA community projects/proposals’ and delivered this to Agency at the end of 2013. The Agency fostered a new collaboration with all partners - the GA community, European Commission and the Member States – and seeked for integrated solutions to increase the probability of acceptance of the results.  Many of the issues have already been addressed, while others are in the pipeline. The Dangerous Goods (DG) case is a good example where the Agency worked closely with Member States DG experts and the GA community to design a simpler approach towards the GA sector. To this end, a proposal for a simplification of the DG requirements in Part NCO has been integrated in the PBN opinion. Focus will be placed on raising DG awareness among GA pilots by means of safety promotion initiatives, to be undertaken by the NAAs. The PBN opinion is available at http://hub.easa.europa.eu/crt/. "
10845,EASA_NEWS_0125,2018-08-10,EASA engaged in a “responsible disclosure” of cybersecurity issues in coordination with operators and authorities," Cyber security is becoming more and more important in the aviation sector due also to technological advances. EASA’s role is to ensure that cyber risks are taken into account during aircrafts design, development and operation and then controlled in order to avoid adverse effects on citizens’ safety. Last year IOActive engaged in a ‘responsible disclosure’ with EASA of some vulnerabilities that had been found in onboard satcom system providing internet to passengers. The process of responsible disclosure ensures that potential safety risks are addressed before the vulnerability is made public. Following this process EASA coordinated with operators and authorities and perform independent verifications. It was concluded that there was no impact on safety, based on the technical knowledge of certified installation. Furthermore, the supplier corrected the vulnerabilities and once it was determined that the corrections were implemented and that no system was accessible from the internet, it was agreed with IOActive that they could publicise their research. More information on what EASA does in this domain can be found on the Cybersecurity page. "
11409,EASA_PR_0189,2006-01-20,Design Organisation Approvals - Feedback Requested," The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has launched an initiative as part of its rulemaking programme to review the concept, rules and implementing procedures relating to Design Organisation Approval (DOA). The aim of this initiative is to determine a possible future structure for such approvals that will both ensure that the necessary safeguards are retained for the airworthiness and continued airworthiness of aircraft, while providing an efficient and economic process that meets the current and future needs of the aviation Industry. A questionnaire has been developed by the Agency as a first step to allow stakeholders to contribute to this review by inputting their experiences of using DOA as well as their future aspirations. Stakeholders are requested to complete the questionnaire and return it to the Agency by 31 March 2006. "
11398,EASA_PR_0175,2007-09-11,Agency issues 2006 Safety Review High level of aviation safety in Europe," EASA's 2006 Annual Safety Review highlights the significant improvements achieved in aviation safety in recent years. Worldwide, 2006 saw the lowest number of fatal accidents (42) to fixed wing aircraft in public transportation within the last decade (1997-2006). 	The Annual Safety Review is compiled by EASA to inform the public of safety levels in civil aviation. The data used are provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the Agency’s 31 members, which include the 27 Member States of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. 	In 2006 the number of fatal accidents to fixed wing aircraft in public transportation in Europe (6) was equal to the average for the decade, although it hasincreased since 2004, which was exceptionally low (2). Even though accident rates in Europe are low, the Agency’s Review indicates that there is still room for improvement. 	Efforts to maintain and improve aviation safety continue to be a priority for EASA. Responding to the need for a coordinated European effort, the Agency launched in April 2006 the European Strategic Safety Initiative (ESSI). The objective of ESSI is to further enhance safety for European citizens, through analysis of data and coordination with safety initiatives worldwide. 	EASA also takes specific actions in response to accident experience. These include working on the improvement of regulatory material in its rulemaking activities and improving the operational system by actions including the issuing of Airworthiness Directives "
26530,EIOPA_NEWS_0193,2020-02-20,EIOPA publicly consults on implementing technical standards for supervisory reporting and cooperation for the Pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP),"Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) launched the public consultation on implementing technical standards for supervisory reporting and cooperation as mandated by the Pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP) Regulation. The proposals specify the annual supervisory reporting requirements on PEPP and formalise the notifications required by the PEPP Regulation to facilitate efficient processes in the cooperation between competent authorities and EIOPA. The regular, annual submission of information on the PEPP business and efficient communication channels between competent authorities are key building blocks of the supervisory framework for the PEPP.  In developing its proposals, EIOPA sought input from the supervisory community of the insurance and pension sectors, the other European Supervisory Authorities, and conducted an active dialogue with EIOPA's stakeholder groups. Stakeholder feedback is necessary to develop further the proposals and to ensure that the requirements enforce strong product supervision for PEPP and effective cooperation between PEPP competent authorities and EIOPA. The consultation ends on 20 May 2020, 23:59 CET."

The Board of Appeal’s decision considered as inadmissable the Appellant’s claim that six national financial supervisory authorities and ESMA should have taken supervisory steps in relation to an alleged non-application of Union law. The Board of Appeal dismissed the appeal brought forward by Mr Howerton as inadmissible as the facts described by the Appellant do not relate in any way to aspects under the supervision of the relevant six national authorities nor of ESMA. The Board of Appeal does not see, therefore, how the six national financial supervisory authorities and ESMA could investigate and take supervisory steps with regard to the facts described by the Appellant in his complaints and in the appeal. Background Between 5 and 6 July 2020 Mr. Howerton sent several requests to investigate six national competent authorities under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. ESMA assessed the content of the requests to investigate and concluded that the facts described in the requests were outside its remit as they did not fall under any of the Union acts referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. The Appellant filed an appeal against this conclusion on 3 August 2020."

26477,EIOPA_NEWS_0140,2020-07-27,Insurance against pandemic risk: EIOPA identifies options for shared resilience solutions,"Today the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published its Issues Paper highlighting options for developing shared resilience solutions for pandemic risk. The paper recognises that private insurance solutions alone will not be sufficient to protect society against the financial consequences of future pandemics. Solutions will require both public and private sector involvement, and build on the following four key elements: Proper risk assessment Risk prevention and adaptation measures Appropriate product design Risk transfer The options include different insurance models and coverage, for example whether cover should be mandatory, and whether payouts should be based on a pre-agreed parameter or index. The options also include different ways the public and private sectors could work together, for example establishing an EU-expert group for data sharing and risk modelling, and creating a platform for public and private coordination on prevention measures. Different potential roles are considered for how the European Union can contribute towards solutions. As a next step, the scope of the shared resilience framework could be expanded to consider further resilience gaps stemming from systemic cyber, climate change impacts in natural catastrophes and terrorism. In developing this paper, EIOPA consulted the insurance and reinsurance industry, as well as commercial insurance buyers and insurance brokers and distributors. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, said: ‘It is of the utmost importance not only to have a debate about how our society can better react to future disruptive events such as Covid19 but also to come up with a way forward. While it is clear that insurance cannot cover the full costs of pandemics, insurers and reinsurers should be part of the solution and not part of the problem. Furthermore, I strongly believe that shared resilience solutions can play an important role in mitigating economic fragmentation throughout the European Union and should be part of the recovery efforts towards a European Union that protects its businesses and its citizens. We invite views on the options raised in the paper’. Read the paper"
26682,EIOPA_NEWS_0345,2018-09-05,ESAs report finds automation in financial advice slowly growing but scale of market remains limited,"Page Content The three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) – EBA, EIOPA and ESMA – today published the results of their monitoring exercise on automation in financial advice. The Report shows that while the phenomenon of automation in financial advice seems to be slowly growing, the overall number of firms and customers involved is still quite limited. As the identified risks have not materialised and considering the limited growth of the phenomenon, the ESAs believe that no immediate action is necessary. Through this Report, the risks and benefits of this phenomenon, which had previously been identified by the ESAs have largely been confirmed by national competent authorities (NCAs) and remain valid. In examining emerging business models, the ESAs found that automated services are being offered, through partnerships, by established financial intermediaries, rather than by pure FinTech firms. Additionally, some new trends are emerging such as the use of Big Data, chatbots and a broader range of products. The ESAs concluded that given the overall importance of the topic, and the emergence of some ongoing changes to business models, a new monitoring exercise will be conducted if and when the development of the market and market risks warrant this work. Background Following the publication of the Report on Automation in Financial Advice in 2016, this new analysis has been carried out through a survey involving NCAs, on the evolution of 'automation in financial advice' in the securities, banking and insurance sectors over the past two years"

13968,EUROFOUND_UNK_0054,2018-10-10,World Mental Health Day: Common approach to burnout still lacking,"Today is World Mental Health Day, a yearly event held by the World Health Organization with the overall objective of raising awareness of mental health issues and mobilising efforts in support of mental health. Eurofound has made a limited number of copies of its latest report on Burnout in the workplace available to order, free of charge, via its website. The report maps research on burnout across the EU, and shows that psychosocial risks rank top as work determinants most likely to cause the condition. Employees with a sustained exposure to such risks as high work intensity, long working hours, emotional demands, low level of autonomy and tense social relationships at work were found to be at a higher risk of burnout, or indeed more likely to already be developing it. Of those risks, differences in individual impact can also be seen across the Member States. For example, studies in Belgium have found that conflicts in the workplace count among one of the top four work-related factors. It is perhaps therefore not surprising to learn that social support from colleagues has been noted as a mitigating factor in several studies carried out in this area. Additional recurrent themes include heavy workload and long working hours, relationship with management and rewards. One element that remains hotly-debated is the issue of autonomy. In many studies, the prevalence of burnout has been shown to be substantially higher when autonomy of the worker is lower. However, other studies report the opposite to be true, such as the association with telework, which suggests that autonomy could be a double-edged sword in the context of burnout, especially when considering work-life balance and the concept of ‘boundaryless work’. We invite you to access the information below to build understanding of the need for a common approach that will assist employees and employers alike in tackling this important issue.

14153,EUROFOUND_UNK_0239,2015-10-14,"‘Only a reinforced partnership of the main European actors can preserve the european project’ / Foundation Focus, September 2015","Interview with David-Pascal Dion Recently appointed Head of Unit for Social Dialogue and Industrial Relations at the European Commission’s Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, David-Pascal Dion discusses the Commission’s firm commitment to strengthening dialogue with social partners across Europe and its role in recent initiatives to reignite social dialogue. Eurofound: Recent research by the Commission and Eurofound has shown that social dialogue came under stress in a number of Member States during the crisis – in particular, in the so-called ‘programme countries’.  What can be done to improve the functioning of social dialogue at Member State level? David-Pascal Dion: Certainly, we have seen that during the later stages of the crisis social dialogue came under strain in many Member States. As also shown in the 2014 edition of Industrial Relations in Europe, the impact has been particularly strong in countries that have received financial assistance. In view of the acute economic pressure, achieving a broad consensus on the necessary reform measures has often proved difficult. Governments have more often taken measures unilaterally. In the framework of the European Semester, the Commission calls for strengthening social partners’ involvement in the design and implementation of policies and reforms at national level. National social partners need a certain degree of capacity to represent their respective interests and to coordinate their work. In a significant number of Member States, more support for capacity-building is needed, while social partners and public authorities from other Member States can usefully share their good practice in a process of mutual learning. The Commission also provides financial support to strengthen industrial relations at national level – in particular, through the European Social Fund. Some voices from among the academic world and the social partners have argued that European social dialogue did not deliver to its full potential in the past. Do you agree? First of all, it should be noted that there is not one single European social dialogue. Social dialogue at the European level is quite varied, with both cross-industry committees and 43 sectoral social dialogue committees that have been active in past decades, delivering a broad range of outcomes including autonomous agreements and agreements that were implemented by Council Directives. However, the Commission agrees that social dialogue at European level could contribute more to addressing the key challenges facing the European labour market and economy. This is why President Juncker has said that he wishes to be ‘the President of social dialogue’ and his Commission has taken these steps to give the social dialogue a fresh start. What steps have been taken so far and what is planned for the ‘renaissance’ of a genuine and effective European social dialogue? Many steps have in fact been taken, and I feel that we have hit the ground running. In the first months of its mandate, this Commission launched the process of the new start for social dialogue with a high-level event that brought together leaders of national social partner organisations from all across Europe.[1] Some 30 years after the launching of European social dialogue by President Delors and four members of the College of Commissioners at Val Duchesse, the new start for social dialogue initiated by President Juncker and four other members of the College highlighted the importance of this process to the Commission. The new start process is organised around two key themes: involvement of social partners in economic governance and support for capacity-building; and the contribution of social partners to policy and law-making. As regards economic governance, the European social partners have already been more closely involved in the discussions during this year’s European Semester. Earlier publication of the country reports allowed the Commission, the national authorities and the employment and social protection committees to engage in an exchange with the social partners before the country-specific recommendations (CSRs) were issued. The March 2015 Employment Guidelines – a document that sets the direction of the coordination of employment policy – emphasise the need for the Member States to closely involve social partners in designing and implementing relevant reforms and policies and to support an improved functioning and effectiveness of social dialogue at national level. The efforts undertaken by Member States in this regard will need to be reflected in next year’s Semester – for instance, in their national reform programmes. The Commission is also keen for the social partners to be more involved in policy and law-making. In consulting the social partners, we want to go beyond the statutory consultation requirements, set out in Articles 154 and 155 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). We have organised dedicated consultation hearings on key employment and social policy dossiers, such as integration of the long-term unemployed or the labour mobility package. But we also wish to involve social partners in areas that do not fall within the employment or social portfolio but that have social and employment impacts – for example, the Investment Plan, the Energy Union, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the Digital Single Market, and so on. Meetings with EU social partners on these topics have already taken place, including with European Commissioners and Vice-Presidents. Finally, we will continue to look for ways to support and strengthen social dialogue at national level through capacity-building. On 14 October 2015, as part of the ‘Open Days’ in Brussels, we are organising a workshop on the use of EU funds in supporting capacity-building. We will also look into ways to foster mutual learning with a view to further improving the functioning and effectiveness of social dialogue at national level. A more detailed discussion on how to follow up on the new start is taking place in the two Thematic Working Groups dedicated to the two key themes with the participation of social partners representing all levels, representatives of Member States and of the Commission, as well as colleagues from Eurofound. Where do you see a role for Eurofound in this relaunch of the social dialogue process? Eurofound is a key partner in providing input in relation to the new start for social dialogue. With its tripartite structure and extensive expertise in industrial relations research, we count on Eurofound’s support – particularly in terms of delivering on the country-specific information, which we need in the context of the European Semester. I would also underline the importance of the representativeness studies carried out by Eurofound; these are essential to ensure the proper functioning of European social dialogue.[2] Similarly, the recent research done by Eurofound on the concept of representativeness at national and at EU levels will provide useful material to deepen our knowledge and understanding of a key feature of social dialogue. You have recently been appointed Head of Unit for Social Dialogue and Industrial Relations at the European Commission’s Employment Directorate-General. What are the main objectives you would like to achieve in this role? In my previous jobs in DG EMPL [as Head of Unit responsible for Coordination, Planning and Inter-institutional relations and earlier as assistant to successive Directors General], I actually followed several social dialogue files. I have, for instance, vivid memories of a discussion with M. Monti, R. Verrue, J. Monks and P. de Buck on the social dimension in the draft Monti Report on the relaunch of the single market. When I took up my new job – after President Juncker announced that he wanted to be the President of social dialogue – I looked back at the launch of social dialogue, 30 years ago, by President Delors and at all its achievements, including its formal recognition in the EU Treaties. Since 1985, the European landscape has changed dramatically. Globalisation, together with technological, demographic and environmental changes, all imply an adaptation of our European social model. Only a reinforced partnership of the main European actors can preserve the European project. Social partners are key actors to ensure a more equitable and a more efficient social market economy. Not properly involving social partners in the design and implementation of reforms and policies runs the risk of failure and of ineffective and unfair outcomes. Therefore, my main objective with the new start for social dialogue is to place social dialogue (European and national, cross-industry and sectoral, bipartite and tripartite) back at the centre of the discussions and of the solutions for a fairer and more effective European Union. And I hope that, in 30 years’ time, our successors won’t feel the need for a new ‘new start’.  Interview: Christian Welz   [1] The event took place on 5 March 2015 in Brussels.

14475,EUROFOUND_UNK_0561,2013-05-13,"Press release, 14 May 2013","Eurofound publishes new comparative research on restructuring in SMEs in Europe: Understanding restructuring in SMEs in Europe Small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) make up more than 99% of European businesses and account for about two thirds of private sector employment. SMEs are subject to change as large businesses, but public and policy discussions on restructuring is mainly focused on large-scale restructuring because of the greater immediate effects, often neglecting specific characteristics and needs of SMEs. Eurofound has carried out comparative research to highlight the challenges facing restructuring in SMEs in Europe, specifically in the area of policy and support measures.  This package of research, which includes a database of 85 company case examples, is presented to members of the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, today. Restructuring in SMEs is less visible and less publicised than that in larger firms, which makes headlines almost on a daily basis. Yet, SMEs are the backbone of the European economy, accounting for more than 99% of European enterprises and about two-thirds of private sector employment. Restructuring is likely to have different manifestations in SMEs than in larger firms and until recently little has been known about the details of restructuring in SMEs and its outcomes. 	Eurofound has now carried out an EU-wide research study which investigated the relevance of different forms of restructuring for SMEs, the drivers of change, the main characteristics, success factors and constraints of SME restructuring as well as the effects of restructuring on companies and employees. The research found that internal restructuring, business expansion and (avoiding) bankruptcy/closure are the most common forms of restructuring in SMEs, and restructuring in SMEs tends to be carried out in a reactive, unplanned way and without formal restructuring plans. Restructuring in SMEs is driven by a combination of company external and company internal factors, hardly ever by a single event. While company external factors are in general the same as for large firms, the company internal factors are very specific for SMEs. These are related to the strong role of the owner/manager in the firm, and the limitations in terms of human resources and financing, and the often prevalent dependency on a few key clients and suppliers. Common for SMEs is that once restructuring is underway, decisions are taken quickly and flexibly. The owner/manager has a core role in SME restructuring, supported by various internal and external stakeholders. It is not common for staff representatives to be involved, however, as the majority of SMEs have no formal staff representation structure. The research findings suggest that policymakers should consider improvements in the support services to SMEs, by offering more comprehensive packages, easier access through one-stop-shops, reframing eligibility criteria; and prioritising access to finance, and the anticipation of change within the company. An overview report, with an executive summary, national reports from all 27 EU Member States and a database with 85 company cases, are available on the Eurofound website.

Stark differences in working time There are substantial differences in working time between the former EU15 Member States and the majority of the new EU Member States (NMS12), according to a new report from Eurofound, Working time developments – 2008. Across the EU, the longest working weeks are in Romania, the Czech Republic and Latvia. The shortest are in France, Belgium and Ireland.  The report, which looks at working time agreements set by collective bargaining, also found that the average number of fully paid holidays for European workers was 25.2 days in 2008; however, this varies considerably between countries, with Sweden having 33 days but Estonia having only 20 days. Reduction in working week appears to have slowed Eurofound has been publishing annual updates on working time for 10 years. Data for the EU15 and Norway have been collected since 1999, over which period the average agreed weekly working hours have fallen from 38.6 hours to 37.9 hours, or by about 1.8%. However, most of this reduction in working time occurred before 2003. Since then, there has been virtually no change in the average collectively agreed working time for western Europe, and general reductions in working hours have scarcely featured on the collective bargaining agenda in most countries. This was again the case in 2008, when agreed cuts in working time without loss of pay were virtually absent from the collective bargaining agenda. While the working week has also reduced in the 10 Member States that joined in 2004 (the NMS10), the reduction has been less: since 2003, average agreed weekly working hours declined by only 0.2 hours – from 39.6 hours to 39.4. Short-time work in response to crisis These collectively agreed reductions in working hours did not entail a loss of pay; however, towards the end of 2008, cuts in working hours with consequent cuts in pay became increasingly topical as the economic crisis deepened. Enforced reductions in working time – and usually pay – in the form of short-time work and temporary layoffs have been on the increase in many EU countries as companies seek to cope with falling demand. Paid annual leave The report also compares the average collectively agreed entitlements for paid annual leave in the EU. It finds that the average number of fully paid holidays in Europe is 25.2 days per year. The average in the EU15 and Norway stands at 26.5 days, with a substantial difference between the average in Sweden (33 days) and in Greece (23 days). Among the new EU Member States, the average is 21.4 days per year, with notable, though smaller, differences between the Czech Republic (25 days) and Estonia (20 days). Read the EIRO report"

The survey’s first findings offer a snapshot of trends in working conditions in the EU, and comparisons across the 28 EU Member States in areas ranging from work-related risks, work and gender, working-time and work organisation, to developing skills at work and lifelong learning. Keynote speakers included Nicolas Schmit, Minister of Labour, Employment and the Social and Solidarity Economy, Luxembourg.  Presentations from the event are now available on the event page. Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Survey series (EWCS) measures working conditions across European countries on a harmonised basis. It analyses relationships between different aspects of working conditions; identifies groups at risks and issues of concern, as well as areas of progress. Since the first survey in 1991, the series monitors trends over time. The European Working Conditions Surveys contribute to European policy development, in particular on quality of work and employment issues. The 6th EWCS is based on over 43,000 face-to-face interviews in 35 European countries."

Short-time schemes reduce working hours The widespread use of government supported short-time working schemes, introduced primarily in manufacturing to cut company costs and save jobs, has reduced the gap between agreed and actual working time in the EU, according to Eurofound's latest annual round-up of working time developments. Short-time working schemes have been extended over the last two years in a number of countries in response to falling demand in the face of recession. Under these schemes, the working hours and pay of employees is cut, with national governments usually making up most of the loss in income: as a result, employers' costs are reduced while worker's jobs and incomes are preserved. Eurofound's previous updates in the series have found that actual working time, in most Member States, is longer than collectively agreed hours; however, the fall in working time resulting from these short-time schemes has meant that actual working time, on average across Europe, has fallen.

Hitting the brakes – the car sector in crisis The ongoing recession has hit European manufacturing industry hard. And of all sectors, it is the automotive sector that has been most affected. Car manufacturing and related suppliers are estimated to make up one third of all European manufacturing jobs. Sales in the first four months of 2009 dropped by around 15% in the EU15 and around 21% in the new Member States.         A new report from Eurofound – Recent restructuring trends and policies in the automotive sector – looks at recent developments in the sector, how the car industry is responding to the ongoing economic crisis and what policy responses have been drawn up at national and European levels. Responses range from support from the EU-funded European Globalisation adjustment Fund and loans from the European Investment Bank to national car scrappage deals and the introduction of short-time work and other forms of working time adjustments. Governments seek to boost demand Since cars are a major investment for most people and are often bought on credit, the banking crisis and the disappearance of cheap loans had an immediate effect on the car industry. Overproduction and falling sales have resulted in car manufacturers across the globe being severely affected, leading to the sale or bankruptcies of several major companies. Many national governments have stepped in to provide emergency loans and create more demand – for example, introducing scrappage schemes that reward the purchaser of a new car with a cash incentive. In the case of Germany, this has boosted consumer demand. However, similar schemes in other countries have yet to demonstrate the same impact. Short-time work schemes As a consequence of falling demand, many car manufacturers have been forced to cut down on production and reduce their workforces. Many thousands of temporary workers have been dismissed or have had their contracts not renewed. However, companies are reluctant to let go of more qualified employees, and instead have instituted schemes offering short-time work. These generally consist of reduced working hours, with the state providing a salary top-up to compensate for reduced wages and ensure continued social security contributions. In Germany and France, previously existing short-time working schemes have been greatly expanded, both in terms of eligibility and time span. However, evaluations conducted in both countries to determine whether short-time working prevents dismissals have come to different conclusions. Company-level initiatives In countries without collective agreements at sectoral level, many companies have developed their own initiatives to maintain staff in the face of falling demand. These include temporary production stops combined with unpaid leave for employees, temporary lay-offs, pay freezes or pay cuts. In some cases – e.g. Bentley Motors in the UK, Toyota UK, Volvo in Sweden and Opel in Poland – the workforce is given the opportunity for training during production stops or short-time work, either to increase skills or to be better prepared in the case of potential dismissal. It remains to be seen whether such measures can help support the automotive sector until the general economic climate picks up again. Research seems to indicate that many producers will not survive unscathed and that more mergers and closures will occur. Download the report"
14122,EUROFOUND_UNK_0208,2015-12-15,"The thorny issue of labour mobility: Hotly debated but still a slow burner / Foundation Focus, December 2015","Free movement of labour – or labour mobility – is high on the EU policy agenda, and it is also a hotly debated issue in some EU Member States. A recent report from Eurofound looks at trends and policies in labour mobility in the EU. At EU level, the discourse around labour mobility has been primarily positive, vaunting the benefits of increased mobility as a strategy to reduce discrepancies between supply and demand in European labour markets. At national level, the political debate is more mixed and dominated increasingly by concerns over the negative effects of labour mobility in terms of social dumping (where cheaper migrant labour undercuts local wage rates) and potential abuse of the welfare systems in receiving countries. This negative discourse, which is becoming increasingly mainstream, at times coexists with a national discourse emphasising the need to attract foreign labour in the face of severe labour shortages. Extent of labour mobility Notwithstanding these political concerns, what is the extent of mobility of workers in the EU? European and national data suggest that the level of mobility both between and within countries remains low by international comparison. Data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicates that the movement of mobile citizens, referred to as free-movement flows, fell by almost 40% in EU countries between 2007 and 2010, but a rebound in free-movement flows within OECD countries of 10% was recorded in 2012, which was mainly accounted for by intra-EU mobility.[1] Germany continued to be the main destination country, receiving almost a third of free-movers. National data indicate that east–west labour mobility continues to dominate south–north flows, but outflows of nationals from recession-hit southern European countries have been steadily increasing. In terms of numbers of EU mobile workers (residing in another EU country), EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) data show that recent EU labour migration is accounted for increasingly by internal EU mobility, which has grown by 22% in the period 2008–2014 (rising from almost 6 million to 7.3 million workers). This coincides with a contraction in the number of non-EU nationals, or third-country nationals, working in the EU in the same period (down by nearly 600,000). This picture is, however, likely to change, with larger numbers of third-country nationals entering the EU from Syria, where the civil war is ongoing, and other Middle East and North African countries, which are in near-constant turmoil following the wave of Arab revolutions in 2011. As for the number of EU mobile workers, these continue to be relatively small; as former EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, László Andor, keen advocate of free movement commented, they are far from suggesting ‘the massive phenomenon’ that is claimed by Eurosceptics. The 7.3 million EU internal migrants who were resident in another EU country in 2014 represent just over 3% of the EU’s total labour force. Germany and the UK are the countries hosting the highest number of EU internal migrants (over 1.7 million in both), but, again, the figures do not indicate mass movements as they account for 5%–6% of the total working population in these countries. Addressing barriers to entry A Special Eurobarometer survey (no. 337) from 2010 found that what keeps intra-EU mobility low is the lack of proficiency in the language of potential destination countries. This impediment was cited by over half of respondents to the survey. On the policy side, although publicly funded language courses are the most commonly available mobility incentive for EU newcomers, they are made available in just 14 Member States. Such incentives are more widely available for third-country nationals as part of integration policies that are largely disconnected from policies supporting labour mobility and therefore do not target EU mobile workers. And yet, integration also concerns EU mobile workers, as demonstrated by the fact that language and cultural issues continue to be the key barriers to labour mobility. According to the Eurobarometer survey, the next most common impediment to intra-EU mobility, cited by 24% of all respondents, is lack of confidence that they would be able to find a job or actual experience of problems finding a job in another country. At EU level, the European Employment Services (EURES) programme with its internet web portal has been enhanced over recent years precisely to address this mobility barrier and to help EU nationals find employment in EU countries other than their own. The European Commission’s new Labour Mobility Package will also focus on how to improve this service. However, European and national data show that informal personal networks such as friends and acquaintances in other countries continue to play a central role in the job search process and are important sources of information about job opportunities in potential destination countries. Good practice example in Germany It will understandably take time before EURES comes to maturity and both employers and job-seekers in the EU become fully aware of the job-matching resources it offers. Nonetheless, EURES has played an important role in facilitating labour mobility in the context of the German MobiPro-EU programme, which was launched in 2013 to attract young unemployed people from other EU countries, particularly Spain, by offering them traineeships and, possibly, openings in the German job market. MobiPro has been a successful undertaking because it directly tackles the financial barriers to mobility by providing financial support and preparatory German language courses in both the sending and the destination countries. There is a lot to learn from such pilot initiatives on how to recruit from abroad and use labour mobility to address pressing labour shortages. Sara Riso [1]  Free movement is the term used by the OECD to cover mobile citizens of the EU who have some basic rights to enter and leave a country within the EU with few restrictions on their movement or duration of stay. Intra-EU mobility refers to EU citizens moving from one Member State to another.   Full publication with references available here   "
13936,EUROFOUND_UNK_0022,2020-03-06,EU Datathon 2020: Creating an economy that works for people – Eurofound data provides critical contribution,"Eurofound’s pan-European data on quality of life and economic developments at regional level is being made available as part of EU Datathon 2020. The EU Datathons are annual open data competitions organised by the Publications Office of the EU to create new value for citizens through innovation and promoting the use of open data produced by the EU institutions. Publications Office of the European Union: The EU Datathon 2020 Eurofound will guide entrants in the competition through the 2016 European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) and 2019 European Jobs Monitor. The 2016 European Quality of Life Survey interviewed nearly 37,000 people in 33 countries – the (then) 28 EU Member States and 5 candidate countries (Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey). The European Quality of Life Survey is the EU's premier source of quality of life data and analyses conducted so far have already revealed general improvements in optimism and satisfaction with living standards since 2011 - with overall life satisfaction and happiness levels remaining stable. However, regional analyses have shown significant discrepancies in quality of life in different parts of Europe, a higher quality of life and life satisfaction in capital regions compared to other regions, and a larger proportion of people struggling to make ends meet in rural Europe.

This included how happy they felt, their optimism about the future, their ability to deal with problems, and their ability to make ends meet. Quality of public services Respondents were asked to evaluate a range of public services in their country, including: health services, education system, public transport, childcare services, long-term care services, social housing and the state pension system. Quality of society Respondents were asked about their living conditions, future prospects and perceptions of society. They also responded to questions indicating their levels of trust in institutions such as national governments, the legal system, the EU, and the media. Eurofound's 2019 European Jobs Monitor underlined the economic determinants of many regional imbalances, by revealing that employment grew by 19% in capital city regions in the EU’s largest Member States between 2002 and 2017, compared to 10-12% in other domestic regions. Overall, capital regions have disproportionately benefitted from the economic ‘services shift’ and changes brought about by globalisation. The data in the report analyses regional shifts in employment over 15 years in Belgium, Germany, UK, France, Italy, Poland, Czechia, Sweden and Spain; 130 regions in total. Creating an economy that works for people is one of the key priorities of the new European Commission, and one of the main themes of this year's Datathon. By using the data that Eurofound is providing, participating teams are invited to create applications that address underlying policy and societal challenges, create new services for citizens and businesses and provide valuable new insights to participating institutions.

Photo by Philippe Molitor for Friends of Europe. News in brief Finding ways to stay at work for longer Positive advances in quality of life and healthcare provision mean that people in Europe are enjoying a longer and healthier old age. However, in order to relieve pressure on social security and pension systems, governments are faced with the challenge of keeping people at work longer. A recently published Eurofound report looks at government and social partner initiatives to keep older workers in the labour market. While some involve financial incentives, others look at ways to enhance working conditions, including flexible working time and health initiatives. Based primarily on the contributions of 28 national correspondents of Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), the research includes seven case studies carried out in six countries that underline the role of the social partners both in implementing measures and in raising awareness among employers and employees. Read Role of governments and social partners in keeping older workers in the labour market A year in the life of Europe – Yearbook 2012 published One of the starkest findings to emerge from Eurofound’s research in 2012 was the divergence between and within countries. Some Member States have suffered greatly; groups that were already vulnerable are suffering more in the crisis and countries are diverging on quality of life measures; higher-paid jobs have proved more resilient than lower paid jobs and have grown in number. Eurofound’s fourth annual yearbook Living and Working in Europe 2012, just published, draws together the threads of Eurofound’s output in 2012 into a narrative that follows developments in the daily and working lives of Europeans. Key sources include the latest waves of the European Working Conditions Survey and the European Quality of Life Survey. Other major research areas look at young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs), the continuing effect of the economic crisis on the labour market, and sustainable work to support longer working lives. Published jointly with the yearbook is the the annual activity report of the Authorising Officer, which describes Eurofound’s research and information and communication programmes. Download the Yearbook 2012 Social services – boosting quality of life for EU citizens Social and public services play a key role in fostering a better quality of life for European citizens, as Eurofound’s research has discovered. In a workshop at the 21st European Social Services Conference on 17–19 June in Dublin, Ireland, Eurofound will present the results of Eurofound’s latest European Quality of Life Survey on satisfaction with public services – particularly in relation to the impact of the crisis. Focusing on health, childcare and long-term care, the workshop will examine the extent to which cost, availability, access and quality impact on people’s use of these services. And it will also seek the views of participants as to how such analyses can assist policymaking. In addition, Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés will speak on addressing the challenges to social care posed by the pressure on public finances and high unemployment levels.

14260,EUROFOUND_UNK_0346,2014-12-17,Spain: Social partners gear up for the next tripartite agreement 2015–2017,"Social partners appear to be going into the latest round of tripartite discussions with increased optimism. Juan Rosell, President of the Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations (CEOE), said improvements in the economic situation in the country meant any Agreement for Employment and Social Dialogue should include the prospect of salary increases. Tripartite talks began on 4 July 2014 when the Minister of Employment, Fátima Báñez, meet with employers’ representatives and trade unions. Discussions were held with Ignacio Fernández Toxo, General Secretary of the Trade Union Confederation of Workers’ Commissions (CCOO) and Cándido Méndez, General Secretary of the General Workers’ Confederation (UGT) over the enhancement of social dialogue and the signing of a new salary agreement. Also at the talks were Rosell and Jesús Terciado, President of the Spanish Confederation of SMEs (CEPYME) from the employers’ side. Although no specific agreement was reached, the meeting implied advancements towards future pacts among social partners. Two weeks later, on 29 July 2014, the Spanish government signed an agreement with social partners on a collection of proposals to be discussed to promote economic growth and employment. The aim of the meeting, attended by the President of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, was an agreement which presented several proposals and key issues to be discussed at tripartite level to improve the situation of the Spanish economy and the labour market. The discussions would be between representatives from the public authorities, trade unions and employers’ representatives. In September 2014, Toni Ferrer from UGT said the Agreement for Employment and Social Dialogue 2012–2014 had not yet been renegotiated. The deadline of the agreement was 31 December 2014 and social partners needed to agree on a new agreement for 2015. He also said the 2012–2014 agreement could not just be extended with the same terms and conditions, because the economic cycle had changed since it was signed. He said it was necessary to modify and adapt the agreement to the new economic situation. The new agreement was expected to cover the 2015–2017 period. Meanwhile, on 18 September 2014, Juan Rosell said the economic context had progressed over the last couple of years and agreed on the need for a new Agreement for Employment and Social Dialogue to include a sectorial perspective on salaries. He said that, while the 2012–2014 agreement saw the social partners settle for wage moderation, for the next deal it was expected that some salary increases would be approved for some specific economic sectors that were showing signs of economic recovery."

34191,ACER_NEWS_0163,2016-11-14,ACER calls for limiting the discrimination between internal and cross-zonal electricity exchanges," ACER publishes today a Recommendation on the common capacity calculation and redispatching and countertrading cost sharing methodologies. This Recommendation establishes a set of high-level principles that aim to ensure that cross-zonal exchanges are not unduly discriminated against internal exchanges. The existing methodologies are indeed based on the assumption that the network must be able to accommodate all flows resulting from internal electricity exchanges, whereas cross-zonal capacities are used as an adjustment variable such that the total flows arising from internal and cross-zonal electricity exchanges comply with operational security limits. As a consequence of this approach, requests for internal electricity exchanges get unlimited and prioritised access to the scarce network capacity, whereas the requests for cross-zonal electricity exchanges can access only that part of the scarce network capacity which is not already used by internal electricity exchanges. The Recommendation therefore proposes that, unless dully and transparently justified by reasons of overall market efficiency and operational security, cross-zonal capacities not be reduced anymore in order to solve congestions created by internal electricity exchanges and that the latter be addressed with proper reconfiguration of bidding zones in the mid-term, appropriate network investments in the long term and by applying remedial actions (e.g. countertrading or redispatching) until the mid-term and long term solutions can be implemented.  Until a proper bidding zone configuration is in place and/or the appropriate investments to reinforce the network are implemented, the Agency’s Recommendation may have an impact on how and to which degree TSOs apply redispatching and countertrading actions. Therefore, the Agency’s Recommendation also addresses the problem of sharing the costs of these actions. These costs should be shared according to the “polluter-pays” principle, where the internal exchanges causing congestions, which need to be relieved by redispatching or countertrading, should be considered as polluters.  Background Information In recent years significant reductions of cross-zonal capacities have been observed on several interconnections in Europe. The cause of these reductions has been identified as the ever-increasing congestions created by electricity exchanges inside bidding zones, which, in turn, reduce the capacity of the networks available for cross-zonal trade. The problem has been presented and analysed in the last few issues of the Agency’s Market Monitoring Report (see the latest electricity wholesale volume​ for details). This Recommendation is addressed to all TSOs and regulatory authorities, which have the task, respectively, to develop and approve the common capacity calculation and redispatching and countertrading methodologies pursuant to the Guideline on Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management. The Agency calls on these methodologies to be compliant with the principles established in the Agency’s Recommendation. Access the Recommendation here.  "
33970,ACER_NEWS_0042,2020-12-17,Network Codes on Demand Connection and on Requirements for HVDC Systems and DC-Connected Power Park Modules on track in most countries," Section 1 Body Html​​According to the latest Monitoring Report by the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today, the implementation of the Network Code on Demand Connection and the Network Code on Requirements for Grid Connection of High Voltage Direct Current Systems and Direct Current-Connected Power Park Modules is well on track in the majority of countries analysed. However, a few National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) confirmed that the implementation of some of the requirements of general application is still outstanding or it has differed from the provisions included in the two Network Codes.Similarly, NRAs reported some requirements in the corresponding national grid codes go beyond those laid down in the EU Regulations.In the report, ACER recommends:Not to withhold connection to the network to a prospective system user that complies with all the requirements and capabilities in the Network Codes, in case it is unable to comply with requirements included only in national regulations.NRAs to complete or promote, if empowered to do so, expeditious implementation of the Network Codes where the implementation has not been yet completed. The Network Code on Demand Connection provides harmonised standards for demand facilities connected to the network. The Network Code on Grid Connection of High Voltage Direct Current Systems and Direct Current-Connected Power Park Modules specifies requirements for long distance direct current connections. These are used to link offshore wind parks to mainland or to connect countries over long distancesThe implementation of a harmonised set of provisions facilitates the competitiveness and the market of generation technologies across Europe.Access the Report."
33938,ACER_PR_024,2015-10-07,," Press Release (ACER- PR-12-15) ACER starts receiving data for the surveillance of the energy markets Ljubljana, 7 October 2015 Today, 7 October 2015, the obligation established by REMIT, the EU Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency, to report records of wholesale energy market transactions, including orders to trade, executed at organised market places, has come into force. As a result, the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) has started to receive the first reports through its REMIT Information System (ARIS). In fact ACER already opened ARIS on Monday this week for the reporting of outstanding long-term contracts executed at organised market places (the so called back-loading). The requirement to report records of wholesale energy market transactions, including orders to trade, is part of the new monitoring framework established by REMIT to detect and deter market abuse in wholesale energy markets. This framework anticipates a shared responsibility between the Agency and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). The Agency will collect trade and fundamental data and will perform monitoring and an initial analysis and assessment of these data. Any detected suspicious instance will be notified to National Regulatory Authorities for investigation and, if necessary, enforcement. ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig, said: “This is a very important milestone in the implementation of REMIT. It has been a formidable challenge for the Agency, as the monitoring framework we are putting in place is unprecedented in its scope and detail. In this respect, I would like to thank all stakeholders who have worked with us over the past years to make this possible, as well as my colleagues in the Agency who were able to overcome the serious lack of resources to deliver this landmark result. With the data that we are collecting from today, the Agency and national regulatory authorities, with whom these data will be shared, will have for the first time a full picture of trading in European wholesale energy markets, which can be used to detect, and thus deter, market manipulation and insider trading. In this way, market participants can be reassured that they all trade on the basis of the same information and consumers that the energy prices they pay reflect market fundamentals and are not distorted by market abusive behaviour”. Two phases for data reporting For the time being, only transactions in wholesale energy contracts admitted to trading at Organised Market Places and fundamental data from the ENTSOs’ central information transparency platforms need to be reported. The remaining wholesale energy contracts (Over the Counter (OTC) standard and non-standard supply contracts; transportation contracts) and reportable fundamental data from Transmission System Operators (TSOs), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) System Operators (LSOs) and Storage System Operators (SSOs) will have to be reported from 7 April 2016. As of today, 31 third party reporting parties are registered and 8 additional third party RRMs are pre- registered in the system. NRAs from the 28 Member States and the Agency will observe the progress Press Release (ACER- PR-12-15) on reporting to ensure that all entities with reporting obligations take adequate steps to fulfil their obligations. Background ACER has been working steadily, with National Regulatory Authorities and energy stakeholders, on the implementation of REMIT, since before it entered into force in December 2011. In June 2014, the Agency opened the platform to support the Centralised European Register of Market Participants (CEREMP) to National Regulatory Authorities for the national registration of market participants. On 8 January 2015, the Agency’s new REMIT Portal went live and became a central point of entry to ARIS allowing the registration of Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs – Registered Reporting Mechanisms). The Portal also provide access to the “Notification Platform” through which anyone who has reasons to believe that market manipulation, including attempted market manipulation, or insider trading has occurred can bring it to the attention of the Agency. Also on 8 January 2015 the Agency provided a REMIT Reporting User Package to help reporting parties understand the REMIT transaction reporting regime and to provide them with sufficient guidance to make informed decisions about their transaction reporting obligations. Specific information about the data reporting requirements can be found on the REMIT Portal. These publications have been ever since accompanied by REMIT Q&A and FAQ papers on REMIT transaction reporting which are updated on a regular basis. Access the REMIT Portal here.
