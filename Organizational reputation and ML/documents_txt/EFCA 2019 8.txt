The Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC) organises a training course for Gambian fisheries inspectors in the framework of the PESCAO programme
20/09/2019
For three days, from 18 to 20 September 2019, twenty fisheries inspectors from the Republic of The Gambia were instructed in control techniques at sea and at landing by trainers from the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA).
Set up and organized by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC), this training aims at building the capacities of competent national and regional monitoring, control and surveillance authorities to and deter Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU), which is one of the components of the PESCAO programme, financed and implemented since 2018 by the European Union (EU).
Thus, fisheries inspectors from various administrations (Navy, Directorate of Fisheries, Sanitary Inspection and Maritime Authority) have followed theoretical and practical training to become familiar with the different techniques and applicable regulations, in the context of the recent membership of the Republic of The Gambia to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the sustainable fisheries partnership agreement signed between the EU and the Republic of The Gambia.
Inaugurated by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Fisheries of the Republic of The Gambia, Mr. Bamba Banja, this training ended with a practical exercise in the fishing port of Banjul, allowing fisheries inspectors from The Gambia to discover new methods of fisheries control and to become familiar with EFCA's e-learning platform.
