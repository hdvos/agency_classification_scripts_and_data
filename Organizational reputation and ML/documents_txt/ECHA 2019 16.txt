ECHA to support identifying new POPs
ECHA/NR/19/36
The Agency will support the European Commission and Member States to develop risk profiles for methoxychlor and Dechlorane Plus®. This contributes to global work to eliminate or limit the use of the most hazardous persistent organic pollutants.
Helsinki, 9 October 2019 –In early October 2019, the Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POPRC) agreed that methoxychlor (EC 200-779-9, CAS 72-43-5) and Dechlorane Plus® (EC 236-948-9, CAS 13560-89-9) fulfil the screening criteria as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Together with the Commission, ECHA will support the committee in the preparation of risk profiles for these two substances and will launch a public consultation on the drafts in early 2020.
If the POPRC adopts the risk profiles, it will conduct risk management evaluations and then eventually recommend to list these substances as persistent organic pollutants in the Stockholm Convention. Listing under this convention would either result in their worldwide elimination or in the strict restriction of their production and use.
Dechlorane Plus® is mainly used as a flame retardant and has been identified as a substance of very high concern (SVHC) under REACH. Methoxychlor is a pesticide and its use in the EU has already been banned since 2002. Both substances have adverse effects to humans and the environment.
As of July 2019, ECHA supports the Commission and the Member States to identify and propose new POPs from the EU to the Stockholm Convention.

Background
