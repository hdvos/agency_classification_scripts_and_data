New EUIPO report shows the value of licensing EUTMs for SMEs



7.5% of SMEs that own EU trade marks (EUTMs) licensed them to others between 2013-2017, according to .
The average annual revenue from licensing EUTMs during the same period is estimated at nearly EUR 65 000 per firm – equivalent to 5.7% of the average turnover of EU SMEs. The estimated annual revenue from licensing out EUTMs by all SMEs in the EU is EUR 1.9 billion.
The report also estimates the overall value of the intangible assets represented by EUTMs licensed by SMEs to be EUR 38 billion, equivalent to EUR 1.3 million per licensing firm, based on an average twenty-year lifespan per EUTM.
The report is the first such estimate carried out by the EUIPO into the value of licensing EUTMs. It is based on the findings of an EU-wide survey of SMEs, weighted per SME intensity at Member State level and matched to the EUIPO’s own databases and the ORBIS database.
