In the afternoon panel entitled “Industrial policy and competition policy – friends or foes?” he will contribute to the discussion about the European competition rules in the digital markets.

Dan Sjöblom: “We don’t always share the same view as our stakeholders of what the challenges and need for solutions are when it comes to digital markets. Nevertheless these opportunities to exchange views are very important and valuable to us in BEREC”.

The FT-ETNO Summit gathers leaders from the world’s top telecom operators and visionaries from other connected sectors, as well as leading officials, investors and academics. The Summit’s purpose is to examine new political and societal sentiments towards technology, as well as the key themes of trust, responsibility and sustainable development.
