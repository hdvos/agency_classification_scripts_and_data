Farm-Saved Seed Seminar, 4 March 2020 in Tartu, Estonia
25 November 2019

On 4 March 2020 a seminar focusing on Farm-Saved Seed will take place in Tartu, Estonia. The seminar is organised by the CPVO in cooperation with the Estonian Ministry of Rural Affairs and the Estonian Agricultural Board.

The main objective of the seminar is to enhance the understanding of farmers regarding the Farm-Saved Seed (FSS) system in Estonia and surrounding countries where breeders face challenges in collecting royalties on FSS from protected varieties. The seminar will focus on the situation in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and Finland. 

The CPVO considers it of great importance that breeders of protected varieties are able to exercise their rights in accordance with the existing legislative acts in the European Union.

The seminar is free of charge. We welcome you to register via the online registation form available on the Estonian Ministry of Rural Affairs website.
