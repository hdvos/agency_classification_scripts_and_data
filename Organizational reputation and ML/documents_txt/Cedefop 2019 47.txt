Latvia: NEET numbers down due to youth guarantee and VET 

Since 2014, the situation in the labour market for young people aged 15 to 29 has improved as more NEETs (not in employment, education and training) have become economically active.
The number of young NEET people has decreased by 36% since 2014.  
In 2014-18, in total 146 000 NEETs were engaged in the youth guarantee programme: 137 651 NEETs participated in job search activities; and 29 526 were provided with long-term support (one- and one-and-a-half-year vocational education programmes, continuing vocational education and professional development programmes, non-formal education programmes, work experience in a subsidised job or non-governmental sector). 
These long-term vocational education programmes (more than 150 qualifications at EQF levels 3 and 4) are provided by 30 vocational education institutions.
This support will continue until 2020. Its current  already indicates the positive impact of activities on the return of NEETs to the labour market, especially after completing initial and continuing vocational programmes.
