EU4MDpartners and cooperation
Professionals, academics and experts from European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries will have the opportunity to participate in the 2020 National Institute on Drug Abuse International Forum, thanks to five bursaries being offered through the EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD) project. The three-year EU-funded project — launched by the EMCDDA in January 2019 — supports national and regional readiness in the ENP area to identify and respond to drug-related health and security threats.

The forum — organised by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) — will take place in Hollywood, Florida, USA from 19–22 June 2020. The event will bring together international experts on various topics in the addiction research field.

As forum collaborator, the EMCDDA will be present at the meeting to share its work and the EU experience, as well as foster global discussions on the future of addiction. In order to apply for the bursary, the candidates will need to submit an abstract for oral or poster presentation through an online application form.

Deadline for applications: 6 January 2020.
