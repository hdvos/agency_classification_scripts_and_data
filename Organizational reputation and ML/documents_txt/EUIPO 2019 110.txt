A world without creativity? See the future as imagined by #IPDENTICAL


Can a world without creativity really exist? This is the question posed by a short film created by the EUIPO.
IPDENTICAL portrays a dystopian future without intellectual property, seen through the eyes of a young woman, played by Spanish actress Manuela Vellés.
The short film has been selected for more than 15 international and European film festivals, and has received awards at the Publicstyka festival in Poland and the Dieciminuti festival in Italy, among others.
IPDENTICAL was produced by the EUIPO to raise awareness about the importance of intellectual property, which underpins economic growth and jobs.  According to a study carried out by the EUIPO and the European Patent Office (EPO), 28% of all jobs in the EU (60 million) depend directly on intellectual property rights-intensive sectors.
