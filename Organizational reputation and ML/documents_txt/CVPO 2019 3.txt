The INVITE R&D project website is live!
06 December 2019

The official website of the INVITE project is now live at www.h2020-invite.eu

INVITE stands for "Innovation in variety testing" and is a 5-year European Union funded project under the Horizon 2020 R&D programme. Its main objective is to foster the introduction of new varieties better adapted to varying biotic and abiotic conditions and to more sustainable crop management practices.

In the context where agriculture is increasingly being urged to reduce its dependency on external inputs, lower its environmental footprint and cope with more variable climatic conditions, INVITE aims to help the valorisation and the promotion of varieties that are more adapted to sustainable management practices, and more resilient to climate change.

The CPVO is part of the INVITE Executive Committee.

You can read the speech of CPVO's President Martin Ekvad at the kick-off meeting of the INVITE Project in Angres in July 2019 and find more information about the objectives, duration and partners in the project on the official INVITE website.
