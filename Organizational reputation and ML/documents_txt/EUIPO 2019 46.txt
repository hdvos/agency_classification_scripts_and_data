New Zealand joins TMclass


As of 9 September, the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ) has joined TMclass.
This latest addition brings the total number of national and regional intellectual property offices, including ARIPO, OAPI, WIPO and EUIPO, involved in the tool to 75.
TMclass offers users the opportunity to search and translate goods and services. The tool also facilitates translation to and from each of the 44 available languages.
The integration of IPONZ into TMclass is a concrete result of the EUIPO’s International Cooperation framework in collaboration with its international partners.
