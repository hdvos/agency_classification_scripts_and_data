Jordanian IP Office now aligned with CP 5



The Jordanian Industrial Property Protection Directorate (), under the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Supply, has published a practice paper concerning the impact of nondistinctive / weak components of trade marks in the examination of likelihood of confusion (relative grounds), assuming that the goods and/or services are identical.
The publication of this practice paper is a result of the joint collaboration between IPPD and the EUIPO, within the framework of its  activities.
The IPPD is at the forefront of non-European IP offices in finding common grounds with the criteria listed under the Common Communication on the Common Practice of Relative Grounds (CP5) — Likelihood of confusion (Impact of non-distinctive / weak components).
The practice paper provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the principles on which the practice is based, which will be generally applied by the IPPD and the IP offices of the European Union Intellectual Property Network ().
The publication of the IPPD’s practice paper seeks to increase transparency, legal certainty and predictability for the benefit of users and examiners of IP offices. It also aims to become a reference for all interested parties, covering a majority of cases.
The practice paper has been made publicly available in Arabic and English — both versions can be found below. It is divided into two parts; the first part summarises the criteria, while the second part provides a complete explanation of the specific criteria applicable in each case.
