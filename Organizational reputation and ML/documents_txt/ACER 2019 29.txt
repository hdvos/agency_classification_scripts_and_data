The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) launches today a public consultation on the design of long-term transmission rights in the Core capacity calculation region.

On 3 July 2019, regulatory authorities of the Core capacity calculation region informed ACER that they could not approve the second amendment proposal of TSOs of the Core capacity calculation region on the regional design of long-term transmission rights.

To take an informed decision on the second amendment proposal, ACER seeks the comments of interested stakeholders on two elements of the second amendment proposal.

All interested stakeholders are invited to submit their comments by 30 August 2019, 23:59 hrs (CET).
