How to notify PIC exports to the UK after UK’s withdrawal from the EU
ECHA/NR/19/08
 
To cover exports taking place in the first 35 days from the date of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU if no withdrawal agreement is in place, a temporary procedure has been made available.
 
Helsinki, 4 March 2019 – ECHA has published a manual export notification form that will allow exporters based in the EU-27 to notify their planned exports to the United Kingdom before the date of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
These export notifications will take effect if the UK is, as of the withdrawal date, a third country without a withdrawal agreement entering into force.
This is a temporary procedure that will allow EU-27 companies that are exporting chemicals subject to the PIC Regulation to the UK right after the withdrawal to comply with their obligations to notify their exports 35 days before the expected date of import.
Once the UK’s withdrawal from the EU has been confirmed, a permanent process will be put in place. ECHA will then follow up with the companies and designated national authorities that have used the temporary procedure.
Details are available on ECHA’s web pages on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
