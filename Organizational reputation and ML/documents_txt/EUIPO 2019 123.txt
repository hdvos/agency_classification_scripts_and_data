Have your say on EU design protection by 31 March


The European Commission has launched a stakeholder consultation to gather evidence and views on the current EU legislation on design protection. The consultation closes on 31 March 2019.
The consultation is launched with the intention of collecting the input of stakeholders on the functioning of the design protection systems in the EU, at Union and at national levels.
This consultation builds on and follows previous research, analysis and targeted surveys conducted as part of two studies on the economic and legal review of those systems.
The consultation activities will help the European Commission to draw conclusions on the need for improvement, modernisation and further harmonisation of the current legal acts.
