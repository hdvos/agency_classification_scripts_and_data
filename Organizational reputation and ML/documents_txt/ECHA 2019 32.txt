Biocidal Products Committee concludes on Union authorisations for disinfectants and pest control
ECHA/NR/19/24
The committee adopted four opinions, including one on the non-approval of an active substance and three on Union authorisation.
Helsinki, 28 June 2019 – The Biocidal Products Committee (BPC) adopted one opinion concluding that the active substance DBNPA should not be approved for product type 4 (food and feed area).
The committee’s opinion is that this active substance has endocrine disrupting properties and, therefore, meets the exclusion criteria. As such DBNPA cannot be approved for product type 4 unless one of the following derogations foreseen in the Biocidal Products Regulation can be applied:
the risk of exposure to the environment, human and animal health is proven to be negligible; or
there is evidence that the active substance is essential to prevent or control a serious danger to the environment, human or animal health; or
the non-approval is shown to have a negative impact on society compared to the risks arising from the use of the substance.
Whether or not a derogation to the exclusion criteria can be applied, is not within the remit of the BPC.
The BPC also adopted positive opinions supporting Union authorisation for:
two applications concerning a biocidal product family based on octanoic acid and octanoic acid and decanoic acid in product type 4 (food and feed area); and
one application concerning a biocidal product family based on permethrin and S-Methoprene in product type 18 (insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods).
