Conclusions on four active substances and two applications for Union authorisation
ECHA/NR/19/47
The Biocidal Products Committee (BPC) adopted seven opinions supporting the approval of four active substances and two opinions for Union authorisation.
Helsinki, 12 December 2019 – The Biocidal Products Committee concluded on the applications of the following active substance product-type combinations:
Icaridin for product-type 19 (repellents and attractants);
Cyanamide for product-types 3 (veterinary hygiene) and 18 (insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods);
Formaldehyde for product-types 2 (disinfectants and algaecides not intended for direct application to humans or animals) and 3 (veterinary hygiene);
Carbendazim for product-types 7 (film preservatives) and 10 (construction material preservatives).
The respective evaluating Member States (eCA) assessed if these active substances meet the new criteria for endocrine-disrupting properties. For cyanamide the eCA concluded – and the BPC confirmed – that this active substance meets the criteria. For the other active substances no conclusion could be drawn by the committee based on the available data.
The BPC also adopted positive opinions on two applications for Union authorisation of a biocidal product family based on propan-2-ol in product-type 2 (disinfectants and algaecides not intended for direct application to humans or animals) and iodine/PVP-iodine in product-types 2 and 4 (food and feed area).
The Commission, together with the EU Member States, will take the final decision on the approval of the active substances and on the Union authorisation of biocidal products.
The committee met from 10 to 11 December 2019. The opinions will be available on ECHA’s website in the near future. The next meeting will be held in March 2020.
