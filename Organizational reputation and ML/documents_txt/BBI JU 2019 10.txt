BBI JU EXILVA PROJECT FEATURED IN EURONEWS REPORT ON BIOECONOMY
12 June 2019
The work of the BBI JU-funded  project is featured in a  report as an example of bio-based solutions that can substitute oil-based products. Starting from 8’ 44’’, the shows the biorefinery that this project is using to transform Norwegian spruce into microfibrillated cellulose (MFC). This bioproduct has proven effective in substituting fossil fuel additives in paint, adhesives and cosmetics.
In the case of paint, thanks to the viscosity of MFC, ‘you avoid the dripping or sagging of the paint when you are applying it to the wall’, highlights Jarle Wikeby, a chemical engineer at Exilva. When it comes to adhesives, MFC can be used to control the hardening process. The project is also starting to look at the film properties of this bioproduct, given its very good oxygen barrier properties and the strength it adds to the products.
Regarding the drivers of European bioeconomy, Pal Romberg, the vice-president of Borregaard, a member of the EXILVA project, underlines that in EXILVA’s case ‘it is not really a cost issue. Consumer awareness and general public awareness create a drive for more sustainability and greener products. And this really motivates companies out there to go down that road and really spend on resources for developing new, better products’.
As part of the report, four beneficiaries of other BBI JU projects are also featured:
Saponia Kemijska, Prehrambena i Farmaceutska Industria D.D. (participates in and  projects)
Fundación CIRCE  Centro de Investigación de Recursos y Consumos Energéticos (in  and  projects)
NOVAMONT SPA (in , , , , ,  and  projects)
