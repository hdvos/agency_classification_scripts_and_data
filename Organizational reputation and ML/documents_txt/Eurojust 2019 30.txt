XXVII anniversary of the assassination of Giovanni Falcone, Palermo, Italy
23/05/2019
Statement by Filippo Spiezia, Vice President of Eurojust and National Member for Italy at Eurojust
We gathered here today to remember the XXVII anniversary of the assassination of Giovanni Falcone and his police bodyguards.
On behalf of the College of Eurojust, the EU’s Judicial Cooperation Unit, I am here to pay our deep respect to the victims of this tragic event and to reaffirm our strong commitment to international cooperation, as a key aspect of the fight against organised crime across the length and breadth of Europe.
Facing up to this serious and growing threat to our societies and our citizens is, indeed, a shared responsibility, and we recognise that Judge Giovanni Falcone was a pioneer, with his activity and ideas, in developing the crucial strategic dimension of international judicial cooperation.
His sacrifice was an outstanding personal contribution to making Italy and Europe a safer place.
By standing united here today, we are also sending a clear message to organised crime groups across Europe: we are walking in his footsteps.
Criminal groups are not the only ones able to operate across borders: so are Europe’s judiciary and law enforcement authorities.
Case by case, at Eurojust, we experience every day the firm commitment of national judicial authorities and individual prosecutors that work together to achieve tangible results.
The history of our Agency proves that the European Union is something very concrete and close to EU citizens, their needs and destinies.
We continue to take deep inspiration from the coordination model that Judge Falcone strongly advocated to create a safer Europe.
