September 2018 the new Regulation for EASA and the European aviation system (EASA’s “Basic Regulation” - Regulation (EU) 2018/1139) entered into force.
To support the aviation community in this transition, EASA has designed a dedicated online e-learning tutorial and is offering it to aviation authorities, industry and other interested stakeholders.
The 2-hour course offers a comprehensive overview of all the main features, focusing on the changes introduced by the new Regulation. Furthermore, it covers all technical areas (operations, flight crew training, ATM/ANS, aerodromes, airworthiness etc.), subdivided into dedicated modules.
