In response to a European Commission request addressed to the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the Agency announces this call for expression of interest for the selection of the 20-member strong ad hoc working group for the purpose of preparing a candidate cybersecurity certification scheme on Cloud Services.
 The candidate cybersecurity certification scheme is envisaged to provide for cybersecurity certification of a broad range of cloud services. The ad hoc working group on cloud services will draw its input from existing schemes and sources, and its first task will be to specify further the scope of the scheme.
The EU Agency for Cybersecurity invites a wide range of stakeholders to express their interest to join this working group. The ad hoc working group on cloud services will include representatives from cloud service providers, cloud service users, providers of value added cloud services, consumer organisations, conformity assessment bodies, scheme owners etc.
The deadline for this call is on 20 January 2020.
Further information on this call including the terms of reference and an application form are available through the page .
