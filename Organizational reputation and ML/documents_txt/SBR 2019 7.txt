Appointment of SRB Board Member Dominique Laboureix as Secretary-General, ACPR
The Single Resolution Board (SRB) congratulates Dominique Laboureix for his appointment as Secretary-General of the French national supervisory and resolution authority, l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR). He will move to the ACPR and take up his new position after his mandate as Board Member and Director for Resolution Planning and Decisions ends.
Since 2015, Mr Laboureix has played a key role in the establishment, development and success of the SRB. He has made a major contribution to its mission to ensure the orderly resolution of failing banks, protecting the taxpayer and promoting financial stability. We are happy that he will continue to be a crucial part of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) and look forward to continuing to work closely with him.
