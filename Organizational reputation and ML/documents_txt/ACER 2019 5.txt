On 6 January 2020 ACER will launch three public consultations on the implementation of the Clean Energy Package. The Agency announces these public consultations well in advance, since the period for feedback will be shorter than usual, given the tight deadlines mandated in the regulations.  

(1) Geographical scope of system operation regions:

 The consultation period will run between 6-19 January. ACER will issue a decision by 6 April 2020.

The decision - according to article 36 of the recast Electricity Regulation - must specify which transmission system operators, bidding zones, bidding zone borders, capacity calculation regions and outage coordination regions are covered by each of the system operation regions. It must take into account the grid topology, including the degree of interconnection and of interdependency of the electricity system in terms of flows and the size of the region, which shall cover at least one capacity calculation region.

(2) Methodology for identifying regional electricity crisis scenarios and

(3) Methodology for short-term and seasonal adequacy assessment

Both consultations will run between 6-12 January. ACER will issue two decisions by 6 March 2020.

The recent EU Regulation on risk-preparedness (RPR) in the electricity sector introduces important rules for cooperation between Member States with a view to preventing, preparing for and managing electricity crises. Part of the Clean Energy Package, the RPR defines - in articles 5 and 8 - common rules for risk preparedness plans and foresees the adoption of the two above-mentioned methodologies during the course of 2020.
