Close-out Event in Stockholm – “PJ05 Remote Tower” Project presents its final results and conclusions
Nov. 26, 2019
On 14th of November the “PJ05 Remote Tower” Project conducted its close-out event at Arlanda Airport, kindly hosted by LFV/COOPANS. About 60 distinguished guests from the aviation industry, unions, regulators, research and representatives from SJU participated at this event and paid attention to the presentations of the SJU, the project coordinator (DLR/AT-One) and the solutions leads (LFV/COOPANS, DFS, and LPS/B4) and discussed the presented results & conclusions. The PJ05 “Multiple” concept and its possibility for a flexible allocation of aerodromes seems to be a promising candidate to balance the ATCOs’ workload and efficiency. During the lunch break the participants were given the chance to visit the brandnew RTC Stockholm from which in the near future several Swedish airports will be controlled.
