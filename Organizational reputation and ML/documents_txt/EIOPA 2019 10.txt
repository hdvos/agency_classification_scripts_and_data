The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority has published its second annual European Insurance Overview.
The European Insurance Overview report is published by EIOPA as an extension of its statistical services in order to provide an easy-to-use and accessible overview of the European insurance sector. The report is based on annually reported Solvency II information. This ensures that the data has a high coverage in all countries and is reported in a consistent manner across the European Economic Area.
The report is objective, factual and data driven and does not contain analysis or policy messages. It provides highly-relevant and easily-accessible data at the European level.
