Cedefop forum to explore community lifelong learning centres' role 

Cedefop, in cooperation with the  is organising a policy forum to explore the potential of community lifelong learning centres as one-stop shops for preventing young people at risk and early school leavers from disconnecting. The event will be hosted by the Romanian EU Presidency in its permanent representation to the EU on 29 May in Brussels.
The forum is addressed to Brussels-based stakeholders from the permanent representations of Member States to the EU, the European Commission, the European Parliament, European agencies, European business and sector associations, trade union and employee organisations, national policy-makers, practitioners and social partners involved in designing and implementing integrated services to tackle early leaving from education and training (ELET).
Discussions will focus on the potential of multidisciplinary teams in community lifelong learning centres (CLLC) to play a key role in tackling ELET. The forum will be an opportunity to discuss Member State experiences in using integrated service delivery (one-stop shops, case management and multi-skilled teams) in different settings.
Participants will consider the potential for establishing CLLCs in disadvantaged areas across Europe. These would offer access to a wider range of learning opportunities for people of all ages, maximising the support offered by multidisciplinary teams. Participants will also be invited to reflect on the post-2020 agenda in the field to ensure continued progress towards improving EU citizens’ qualifications and skills.
Due to the limited number of places, those who wish to participate should contact Cedefop expert Irene Psifidou, who is the event's project manager
