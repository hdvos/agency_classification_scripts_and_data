The online  provides first-hand assistance to media professionals with learning resources, training courses, and opportunities to share and interact.
The learning section allows users to take courses in which journalists or editors of leading media outlets share their real-life newsroom dilemmas of reporting on migration. Training provides material for media trainers to design their own courses. In addition, sharing allows users to interact with other users through forum discussions on fundamental rights and ethical journalism principles. Users can also propose new courses or download the news examples for further discussion among peers.
Drawing on input from leading media outlets like Agence France-Presse, Le Monde, The Guardian, Radio France International, France TV, the BBC, and the Financial Times, the toolkit offers wide-ranging guidance on covering migration from different types of media.
This includes how to ethical reporting treating people fairly and with dignity, balancing accuracy, impartiality and humanity as well as the importance of context in providing balanced, impartial coverage.
FRA developed this toolkit together with the European Broadcasting Union and the Ethical Journalism Network with the support of the European Federation of Journalists. It builds on the popular 2008  that FRA also developed in close partnership with the European Broadcasting Union.
