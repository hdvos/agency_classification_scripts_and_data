The nine EU Justice and Home Affairs Agencies are marking the 10-year anniversary of the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights by pledging to continue to respect and promote fundamental rights throughout the work.

“Over the 10 years we have seen the Charter growing in impact but with still room for improvement,”says FRA Director Michael O’Flaherty. “Now consistently, it is time to continue to build on what has been achieved and work towards greater recognition of what the Charter guarantees. This joint commitment by the Justice and Home Affairs’ Agencies is a great place to reaffirm our ongoing efforts towards that end.
The agencies have agreed to continue to promote and protect fundamental rights throughout their work. This includes ensuring their work always complies with the Charter.
They will continue to uphold fundamental rights in their working practices such as promoting gender equality and diversity at work.
They will also run awareness raising activities, staff training, joint activities to increase awareness about the Charter and its entitlements.
In addition, they will continue to build and enhance their capacity to respect the Charter by sharing and exchanging best practices. This will form part of their regular network meetings of Justice and Home Affairs Agencies, chaired this year by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol).
