​The European Union (EU) Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) opens registration today for a public workshop scheduled on 13 November in Brussels. The workshop will focus on three decisions according to the EU Regulation on Electricity Balancing to provide common rules across Member States:

In part I the pricing methodology for balancing energy and cross-zonal capacity will be discussed. This methodology provides the rules for the efficient pricing of the balancing energy that results from bids activation and of the cross-zonal capacity used for the exchange of balancing energy.
Part II of the workshop will focus on the implementation framework for establishing a European platform for the exchange of balancing energy from frequency restoration reserves with automatic activation (aFRR).

Part III will be dedicated to the implementation framework for establishing a European platform for the exchange of balancing energy from frequency restoration reserves with manual activation (m​FRR).

All interested parties are invited to register here by 11 November 2019. ​
