EXTRA €45.4 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR FET RESEARCH ON LOW CARBON ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES
The European Innovation Council (EIC) Pathfinder Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) Proactive 2019 call budget has been increased by €45.4 million. This budget is ring-fenced for low carbon energy and climate change related technologies, and the call deadline has been postponed until 8 October 2019.
Following discussions with Member State representatives, the Commission is now amending the H2020 EIC Work Programme (WP) for 2019 to update the two FET Proactive topics in the EIC Pathfinder. The changes are expected to be formally adopted and published in the Funding and Tenders online portal by the end of June 2019. The main changes are:
The scope of sub-topic (c) of FETPROACT-EIC-05-2019 "Breakthrough zero-emissions energy generation for full decarbonisation" has been expanded to now include research on novel, advanced technologies for batteries, solar and fuel cells in addition to its previous subject areas. A budget of between €35.4 million and €52.4 million will now be reserved for this sub-topic.
FET Open and Proactive projects that address the area of low-carbon energy and climate change technologies can now apply to the FETPROACT-EIC-06-2019 transition to innovation activities topic. Between €10 million and €13 million will be allocated to projects from this area.
