Likewise, very advanced contacts are being maintained with the main players of the wind sector for the installation of their two solutions, both modular blade and self-erecting tower, planned for 2020 and 2021.
The profile of the new partners has prevailed. One of them with a deep presence in Navarre and recognised industrial trajectory, the other one with an outstanding knowledge of the wind sector. Their presence will provide additional added value, beyond mere financial support, which is also important.
