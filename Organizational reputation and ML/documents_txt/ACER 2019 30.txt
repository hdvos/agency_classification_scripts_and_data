The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today a Decision setting the common methodology for coordinated redispatching and countertrading in Bulgaria, Greece and Romania (the South East Europe region). The adopted methodology establishes a coordinated use of redispatching and countertrading resources among the three Transmission System Operators (TSOs): ESO EAD (Bulgaria), ADMIE (Greece) and Transelectrica (Romania). 

The implementation of the methodology will be achieved by 1st July 2021. Once implemented, it is expected to increase the ability for relevant TSOs and Member States to efficiently use redispatching and countertrading in order to alleviate congestion and avoid unnecessary curtailments of cross-border capacities. The new methodology will also significantly increase the transparency and understanding of how TSOs optimise the use of available redispatching and countertrading resources.
