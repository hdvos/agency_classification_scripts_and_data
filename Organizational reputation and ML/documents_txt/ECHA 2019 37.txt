ECHA/NR/19/21
The Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) adopted its opinion on the restriction proposal on granules and mulches used as infill material in synthetic turf pitches or in loose forms on playgrounds. The Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (SEAC) agreed its draft opinion on the same proposal.
Helsinki, 18 June 2019 – RAC and SEAC supported the restriction proposal by the Netherlands to not place the granules and mulches in question on the market if the sum of the listed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the materials is more than 20 mg/kg. A public consultation on the SEAC opinion will begin soon and the committee is expected to adopt an opinion in its September meeting.
RAC also adopted 10 opinions for harmonised classification and labelling, including opinions on seven active substances used in biocidal products and/or plant protection products and three in industrial chemicals.
RAC and SEAC agreed on eight draft opinions on uses of chromium trioxide. Furthermore, RAC and SEAC discussed key issues in 11 applications for authorisation, which were received by ECHA in February 2019. More information about the opinions is available in the annex.
