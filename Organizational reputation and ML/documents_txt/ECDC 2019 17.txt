On 28 January, Public Health England (PHE) launched a new multilingual survey, funded by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which aims to gain an understanding of European healthcare workers’ knowledge and attitudes about antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. 
Previous studies have primarily focused on the general public and medical students, highlighting a gap in the understanding of these topics by healthcare workers and other health students.
The objectives of the study for ECDC are therefore:
to gain a better understanding of their knowledge and perceptions to provide a base to support future needs in terms of policy and education changes, and
to fill in gaps in terms of evaluation of communication campaigns targeting healthcare workers
ECDC and PHE are aiming for a return of at least 10 000 responses with representation from healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, pharmacists and hospital managers, as well as clinical scientists, physiotherapists, nursing assistants, dental/pharmacy technicians, public health teams and health students.
The survey, which takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete and is available in all EU/EEA languages, closes on1 March 2019.
