 systems ensure proactive monitoring of all authorised medicines throughout their lifecycle in clinical use. Signal detection and management are core activities in , rapidly delivering new information on the safety of medicines in real-world use which helps to fill knowledge gaps.  At the heart of this process is a strong collaboration based on expertise from the  and EMA, with the contribution of the  systems of marketing-authorisation holders, combined with a culture of continuous improvement.
In the first six years of the implementation of the  legislation, over 26,000 potential signals were reviewed, resulting in 453 signals assessed by EMA’s safety committee (). More than half of the  recommendations resulted in changes to medicine  supporting the safe and effective use of medicines. The system proved responsive with recommendations for risk minimisation measures made in as few as five days of a signal being confirmed (with a median of five months).
The article describes the signal management process in place in the EU, underpinned by transparency, with specific actions to rapidly communicate reliable information on the safety of medicines to patients and healthcare professionals.
