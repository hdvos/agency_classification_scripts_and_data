Malta: financial incentives promoting VET

The Maltese government is offering incentives for vocational education and training (VET) at all levels of education through financial measures.
VET in compulsory education
In 2014, Maltese government reintroduced elective vocational programmes at EQF 3 in the final three years of compulsory schooling. Three years on, almost 45% of learners study vocational subjects.
The Ministry for Education and Employment (MEDE) is seeking to establish partnership agreements with different sectors of industry and combine learning in schools and training at the workplace for secondary, compulsory education learners. Staff involved in learners’ training receives State funding. One partnership agreement has already been concluded with hotel establishments in Malta.
More partnership agreements are being negotiated with several sectors:
engineering technology;
health/social care;
agribusiness;
information technology;
retail.
Students in further and higher education
All students in further and higher education institutions receive monthly stipends.
Apprenticeship in further and higher education
All programmes in further and higher VET institutions include work-based learning. In accordance with the Work-Based Learning and Apprenticeship Act enacted in March 2018, apprentices are granted the legal status of paid employee and receive income equivalent to the national minimum wage for the hours spent at the workplace.
Sponsors signing training agreements with learners and training providers are eligible for tax incentives relative to the cost of workplace training.

 is an initiative supporting personal development and the attainment of qualifications and certifications. On successful completion, learners attending vocational programmes leading to certification, diploma, degree or post-graduate degree programmes benefit from tax credits recovering 70% of fees paid for enrolment, study programmes and exams.
