HYDROGEN REGIONS GET FURTHER SUPPORT IN GERMANY 
Germany is on its way to becoming a hydrogen country: 16 more regions received today, 12 December 2019, support for developing H2 projects.
The development of hydrogen regions (“valleys”) can foster economic growth in the European regions while answering to the local energy needs and reducing pollution. It covers the entire hydrogen value chain: production, storage, distribution and final use. As such, “Hydrogen Valleys” offer a pathway for scaling up and making this technology a viable solution. 
At European level, the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) had selected earlier this year the Northern Netherlands region to start negotiations for an EU grant agreement valued at 20 million euros. The grant is meant to develop a fully-fledged green hydrogen value chain in the Northern Netherlands, which will thus become the first fully-fledged "hydrogen region" in Europe. The HEAVENN project (H2 Energy Applications in Valley Environments for Northern Netherlands) is unique because it comprises an entire hydrogen value chain within one geographical region. 
In Germany, the winners of the HyPerformer category will each receive 20 million euros in the form of investment grants to implement existing regional concepts with hydrogen and fuel cells. The three HyPerformers have a total project volume of 195 million euros. 
Landshut Region (with the Districts of Munich and Ebersberg)
Metropolitan Region Northwest (Oldenburg and surroundings)
Metropolitan Region Rhine-Neckar (around Mannheim and Heidelberg)
Other 13 HyExpert regions will each receive 300,000 euros to create and calculate concrete project ideas for hydrogen concepts.
Funding  is provided by the National Innovation Programme Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NIP2). More information on the selected regions can be found .
Coordination with other German and European H2 regions is key for identifying and realising synergies at European scale.
