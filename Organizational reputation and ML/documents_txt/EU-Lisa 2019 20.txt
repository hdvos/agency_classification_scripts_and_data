VIS Operational Training Course delivered in Strasbourg 
The second cycle of eu-LISA VIS Development Training Programme for IT Operators (DTPITO) moved forward earlier this month with the delivery of an Intermediate Level (L2) session on the 6th of March.
The aim of the course was to introduce VIS operational system principles, technical system aspects and to provide a detailed overview of operations. 
The target audience was Single Point of Contact (SPoC) managers and senior operational staff from Member States.
During the course the following topics were covered:
Introduction to VIS Incident Management and Request Fulfilment;
VIS Data Quality and VIS Service Manager 9 (SM9)
Incident and Requests Management - Hands on.
Twelve participants from 10 EU Member States were trained during the Intermediate Level course. The training was supported with possibilities for e-learning through the eu-LISA LMS.
The attendees also had the opportunity to take an assessment test to measure the level of knowledge acquired during the training with 11 of them obtaining a VIS Professional certificate. The average test result was 86.7%.
DTPITO will continue with VIS Development Training Programme for IT Operators - Advanced Level (L3) on 3-4 April 2019 in Tallinn, Estonia. This will be the first ever training activity for Member States that will take place in eu-LISA's headquarters.
