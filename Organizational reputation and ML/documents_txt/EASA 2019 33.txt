Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/1119 for Declared Training Organisations (DTO) was published on 13 August 2018 and entered into force on 2 September 2018.

The new Part-DTO grants significant alleviations for the general aviation training domain and, compared to the so far existing requirements for training organisations (Part-ORA), a simplified regulatory framework for training organisations providing training for general aviation pilots. 

The new Part-DTO training course aims at providing implementation support for: 

competent authorities who need to apply the new provisions related to DTOs, when discharging their responsibilities as national aviation authorities;
individuals and organisations who run or wish to establish a DTO and need to increase their knowledge on Part-DTO; and
EASA standardisation team leaders and members who will be involved in assessing a Member State’s competent authority’s oversight performance with regard to DTOs.
Register to the next training session on 18/10/2019 and or visit the EASA Learning Gateway (ELG) to view our training catalogues for  Aviation Authorities and Aviation Organisations.
