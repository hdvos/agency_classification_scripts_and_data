Shift2Rail is delighted to be launching together with the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking a joint  The study assesses the state of the art, the business case, the market potential, specific case studies and technical and non-technical barriers to the use of FCH technology in different rail applications.

The study and the accompanying reports are available below:




To present these results the FCH JU and S2R JU are organising a workshop on Friday 17 May 2019 in Brussels. The workshop will gather the most relevant technology providers, members of the rail sector community and policy makers for a discussion on the next steps on the use of fuel cells and hydrogen in the railway environment.
We are pleased to invite you to this event, which will gather the most relevant technology providers, members of the rail sector community and policy makers for a discussion on the next steps on the use of fuel cells and hydrogen in the railway environment.
The main conclusions of the study point to a good potential for fuel cells for the replacement of diesel rolling stock. Multiple units, shunter locomotives and freight locomotives are three applications evaluated in the study, with some already showing a positive Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for fuel cells, while in other applications fuel cells are recognised as the most adequate zero-emission alternative.
We invite you to read the study’s  and  of the workshop.
