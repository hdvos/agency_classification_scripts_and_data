Shift2Rail and  signed yesterday a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Paris at UIC’s conference on the Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS).
Shift2Rail research and innovation results will be feeding ETSI working groups facilitating, under the leadership of the European Commission, the creation of the next future-proof standards for telecommunications applicable to the railway. Shift2Rail expects that this cooperative work among the sector will help the practical market implementation of solutions like wirelessly connected trains (next generation of TCMS) and, together with the European Railway Agency, adaptable communication systems applied to train to ground communication first over ETCS, but open to all rail modes needs.
Shift2Rail is also collaborating in the research area on railways signalling communication with the UIC project FRMCS. The consolidated approach would enable bearer independence, scalability and modularity enabling future-proof features of the successor of GSM-R that the European Agency for Railways will have to consider in the context of the new .
This MoU is another element that contributes to facilitate the market uptake of the Shift2Rail programme innovative solutions in the years to come.
