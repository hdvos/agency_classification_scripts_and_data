26Mar2019
ERA and the Institute for an Industrial Safety Culture (ICSI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation in the field of safety culture and safety management. This cooperation aims at improving railway safety by developing a positive safety culture in any EU railway organisation. 

Activities focus on evaluating safety culture and implementing training on safety leadership in EU railways.
In 2018 ERA has developed the European railway safety culture model. Together with ICSI it will now test this model, develop related evaluation tools, methodologies and training materials.
The film ‘Between the lines’ which ERA developed in 2018 will be the basis for a 1-day training on safety leadership targeted at managers at all levels in any railway organisation. ERA intends to finalise this training together with ICSI and to implement it in the EU railway sector as from mid-2019.
ICSI has built a deep and cross-industry expertise in the field of safety culture and training on safety leadership. More information .
