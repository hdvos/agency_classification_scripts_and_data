COORDINATORS' DAY 2019 – THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE GRANT AGREEMENTS HAVE COMMENCED 
Following the evaluation of the proposals received in the 2019 Call,  the FCH JU Programme Office invited the coordinators of the successful projects on 20 September 2019, for a day of presentations covering all the details on the preparation and signature of a grant agreement.
The number of proposals that can finally be funded depends on the available budget and the formal approval of grant agreements by the FCH JU. It is expected that the first grant agreements will be signed by December 2019. 
Other relevant topics for the projects, such as audit, knowledge management, dissemination and communication, were presented as well.
