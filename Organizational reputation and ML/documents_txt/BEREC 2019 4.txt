With the estimated total value of excluding VAT 3 000 000,00 EUR, the Agency for Support for BEREC (the BEREC Office) launched an open tender procedure for the provision of reimbursement services of travel/accommodation expenses for experts participating in BEREC events. The contract notice has been published in the Official Journal of the EU.

The main objective of the framework contract is the provision of services related to reimbursement of travel, subsistence and other expenses incurred in the course of journeys made by people not employed by the BEREC Office and invited to attend meetings in an expert capacity.

The contractor will be asked to:

collect all the supporting documents necessary for processing applications for reimbursements (as mentioned above) via designated email address;
prepare the calculation of the amount due;
reimburse the eligible participants to the bank account of the national regulatory authority concerned or other bank accounts specified in case of reimbursement of private experts.
 

Deadline to submit tenders is 6 January 2020 11:00 (Riga time).

The BEREC Office uses the specialized electronic edition of the Official Journal of the EU for procurement â€“ TED e-Tendering and publishes information on the BEREC website and its social media accounts, to ensure the transparency of the procurement procedures. TED eTendering is an EU institutions' eProcurement platform allowing free electronic access to call for tenders' documents such as contractual documentation, technical specifications, annexes, questions and answers etc., TED eTendering effectively represents an added-value extension to TED (Tenders Electronic Daily), the online version of the "Supplement to the Official Journal of the European Union".

e-Tendering is also used for the electronic exchange of information between the BEREC Office and the potential contractors, as well as for the electronic submission of documents in response to call for tenders. More details on the e-submission in the Quick Reference Guide.
