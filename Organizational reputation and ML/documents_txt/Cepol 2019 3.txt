CEPOL's Executive Director, Dr. h. c. Detlef Schröder met earlier today in Riga with the Latvian Minister of Interior, Mr Sandis Ģirģens, and with the Chief of Latvian State Police, General Ints Ķuzis.
Latvia has been strongly involved in CEPOL activities for many years. A forward looking discussion on future cooperation on law enforcement training as well as Latvia's training expectations in the future were on the agenda today.
Today’s meeting also provided a chance to reflect on possible cooperation with Latvia in CEPOL’s capacity building projects with the Eastern Partnership countries.
Mr Schröder thanked Latvian state representatives on standing support for CEPOL and its activities and called for an even greater participation in CEPOL residential and eLearning activities as well as in European Joint Master Programme (EJMP) which is welcoming its second generation of graduates in just a few weeks.
CEPOL's Executive Director commented on the meetings:
Very interesting consultation in Riga today! I have had the honour to meet the Minister of Interior, the State Secretary of the Minister of Interior, the Chief of Police of Latvia and different representatives of the law enforcement services in today in the capital city of Latvia. We have had in-depth discussions on the current situation and challenges in Latvia. We discussed as well how the cooperation with CEPOL is established and how this can be even further improved. We had discussions on quality management and assurance of training, including higher education, leadership training, trainer qualification, digital competence and recruitments. The services in Latvia are already for many years an excellent partner of CEPOL, and it was encouraging to see today their strong commitment and interest. And really great thanks for the excellent hospitality provided!!
