Industry Associations release Executive Summary the ECS-SRA for 2019 

Industry Associations released the Executive Summary of the recently published ECS SRA for 2019. The first ever joint Electronic Components & Systems (ECS) Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) was published last year, in January 2018. During the last year's EFECS in Lisbon in November 2018, the participants shared their feedback and inputs before drafting the final version of this document. 
This common framework for Research, Development and Innovation (R&D&I) identifies technology challenges and research priorities along 10 key application areas and essential capabilities, to foster Europe’s transformation into a digital society, and to deliver societal and economic value. The ECS SRA incorporates the work of over 250 experts, with each chapter detailing how innovation can bring solutions to European challenges. It is a tool to coordinate R&D&I and funding for technologies that support multiple application areas as well as specific area needs. ECSEL JU adopts the technical content of this document for the Multi-Annual Strategic Plan.
