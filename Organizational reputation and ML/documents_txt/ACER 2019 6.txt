The Agency has adopted a Decision - at the request of all National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) for energy - to extend the period for reaching an agreement on the amended proposal presented by Transmission System Operators (TSOs) for a common methodology for calculating scheduled exchanges resulting from single intraday coupling.

As the proposal had to be resubmitted by TSOs to correct some editorial mistakes, all NRAs requested ACER for an additional month to approve this common methodology at a national level. The methodology has been developed according to the EU Regulation establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management.

The Agency granted the extension period through its decision published today.
