The ELA will have its seat in Bratislava, Slovakia, and, when it is fully operational in 2024, there will be approximately 140 staff, including some seconded experts from EU Member States who will act as National Liaison Officers. Its annual budget will amount to approximately EUR 50 million.
The Authority will temporarily be based in Brussels, in one of the buildings of the Commission’s Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL). The interim Executive Director of the ELA is Jordi Curell Gotor. He took up his duties on 31 July 2019.
The ELA’s mission will be to ensure ‘that EU rules on labour mobility and social security coordination are enforced in a fair and effective way’ and that it becomes ‘easier for citizens and businesses to reap the benefits of the internal market’ (see link to ELA website below).
The Centre looks forward to cooperating with the ELA and to meeting the Authority’s multilingual needs so that the ELA can fulfil its important role on the EU’s labour market.
