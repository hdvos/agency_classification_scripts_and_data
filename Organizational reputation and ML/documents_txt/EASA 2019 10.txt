EASA and the European Commission (DG-CLIMA) jointly published the ‘Halon replacement in the aviation industry’ guide to support aviation industry in complying with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (the Ozone Regulation) on halon replacement. 

The document provides in particular clarifications on the interpretation of the cut-off dates applicability, as well as information on the derogation process. 

It is for the attention of applicants for type certificate (to help them to determine when their proposed new design needs to comply with the Ozone Regulation), and also EASA staff (during certification projects).

This is an example of great collaboration between EASA, DG-CLIMA and DG-MOVE.
