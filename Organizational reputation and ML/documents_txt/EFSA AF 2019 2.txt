European Antibiotic Awareness Day 2019


Today is European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD).

European Antibiotic Awareness Day takes place every year on 18 November to raise awareness of the threat to public health from antibiotic resistance and the importance of prudent use of antibiotics.

Fighting antibiotic resistance is a priority for EFSA. Learn more about EFSA’s activities on antibiotic resistance.
