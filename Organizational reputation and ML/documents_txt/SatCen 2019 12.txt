HR/VP MOGHERINI EMPHASIZES THE VALUE OF SATCEN SERVICES AT THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE SATCEN EXHIBITION AT THE EEAS
HR/VP Mogherini emphasized the value of SatCen services at the official opening of the SatCen Exhibition at the European External Action Service (EEAS) on 1 April 2019. Also present was the Chairman of the EU Military Committee, General Claudio Graziano.
The exhibition, which will remain open until 12 of April 2019, shows 36 examples of SatCen analyses in support of EU external action and its Member States, from battle damage assessment and contingency planning to products created within the Copernicus Security Service and Space Surveillance and Tracking.
The main users of SatCen services are the EEAS – especially the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN), the EU Military Staff (EUMS) and EU missions and operations –, the European Commission, other EU Agencies such as Frontex, Member States, Third States and international organisations such as the UN, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The exhibition covers a presentation of SatCen and its mission, the main thematic domains of SatCen, e.g. Security Surveillance including treaty verification, border control, piracy and coastal analysis, cultural heritage monitoring, contingency planning, humanitarian aid, critical infrastructure, military capabilities and weapons of mass destruction.
It also explains Copernicus services in support to EU External Action (Copernicus SEA) and Space Surveillance and Tracking activities contributing to the protection of space assets.
Finally, the interaction with intelligence structures at the EEAS is illustrated, i.e. the Single Intelligence Analysis Capacity (SIAC) consisting of INTCEN and the Intelligence branch of the EUMS, enhancing EU situational awareness.
