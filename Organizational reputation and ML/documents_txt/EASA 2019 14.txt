Lisbon, 23 January 2019 -The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) welcomed in Lisbon the first Conference on Transport Cybersecurity, with the support of the European Commission (DG MOVE), the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the EU Agency for Railways (ERA). 
Over 150 public and private representatives from all transport modes in Europe took part in the event. They discussed the EU legal framework for cybersecurity, its relevance for the transport sector, and explored options for further cooperation.  
“To deter potential cyberattacks targeted at the transport system, cooperation is vital among all partners. Today’s discussions have highlighted that aviation is probably in front among the transport modes to launch concrete initiatives. EASA is working on ensuring a high and equal level of protection in the entire EU aviation system through a coming regulation of cyber security. And EASA is together with industry setting up the institutional framework to facilitate exchange of sensitive information on cyber security so all can learn and improve” - Jesper Rasmussen, Flight Standards Director, EASA.
The cooperation between DG MOVE, DG CONNECT, ENISA, EASA, EMSA and ERA is crucial to raise the importance of cybersecurity in transport.
