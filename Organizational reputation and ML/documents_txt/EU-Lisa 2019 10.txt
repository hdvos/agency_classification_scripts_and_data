eu-LISA Annual Conference and Industry Roundtable Highlights 
On 16 October 2019, the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale ITSystems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) hosted its sixth Annual Conference, "The New Information Architecture as a Driver for Efficiency and Effectiveness in Internal Security", in Tallinn, Estonia. The conference was organised under the auspices of the Finnish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The event - which was the first to take place since the provision of an extended mandate to the Agency through the approval of the new eu-LISA regulation - sought to define desirable milestones that best fulfil the goals of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of internal-security related efforts.
The conference was followed by the eleventh eu-LISA Industry Roundtable, on 17 October 2019. Titled “Towards Practical Implementation of the New JHA Information Architecture”, the roundtable aimed to discuss concrete solutions for implementing the new interoperable architecture that are aligned with legal, functional and technical requirements.
Both events attracted audience from all EU Member States, Schengen Associated Countries, EU institutions and EU Agencies, as well as industry and academia from across Europe, the United States and Canada.
