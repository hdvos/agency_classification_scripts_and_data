H.E. CHRISTIAN EBNER, AMBASSADOR OF AUSTRIA IN SPAIN, VISITS SATCEN
On 24 October 2019, H.E. Christian EBNER, Ambassador of Austria in Spain, visited SatCen together with Defence Attaché Colonel Nikolaus ROTTENBERGER and Minister Counsellor Ms Ulrike NGUYEN.
Amb. Ducaru gave an introduction to SatCen activities and governance, also explaining the evolution of the demand for SatCen products, 90% of which are now produced within 24 hours after data reception.
Customization and development of tools for the analysis of satellite imagery was also discussed. Head of Operations Adriano Baptista explained how artificial intelligence eases the work of SatCen analysts by scanning huge areas to detect objects of interest, so that the analysts can focus on the analysis itself and not waste unnecessary time on detection.
Thereafter, Ambassador EBNER was led to the Operations Division where imagery analysts showed examples of SatCen products, such as, for instance coastal monitoring products for Frontex.
H.E. Christian EBNER has been Ambassador and Head of Cabinet of the Austrian Minister for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs since 2015.
