Member States will evaluate 31 substances in 2019
ECHA/NR/19/12

ECHA has adopted the updated Community rolling action plan (CoRAP) for substance evaluation, with 100 substances listed to be evaluated in 2019-2021. Registrants of the listed substances are encouraged to keep their registrations up to date and to contact the evaluating Member States.
 
Helsinki, 19 March 2019 – 19 Member States are to evaluate 100 substances over the next three years. For the 31 substances specified for 2019, the evaluating authorities have 12 months from today to carry out their evaluations.
The aim of the evaluation is to clarify whether further information is needed to conclude whether a substance poses a risk to people or the environment. If necessary, the registrants will be asked to provide this information. The authorities will assess the suspected concern and, where relevant, initiate regulatory risk management actions.
ECHA encourages registrants of the listed substances to coordinate their actions and to contact the evaluating Member State. Registrants are also urged to update their dossiers, especially for uses and exposures. They will have the opportunity to comment before any decision to request further information is taken. The draft decisions by the evaluating authorities will be reviewed by the other Member States and ECHA before the final decision is issued.
Substances are selected for evaluation based on concerns related to their suspected serious hazard properties. The substances may be suspected sensitisers, persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substances, carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic (CMR) substances or endocrine disruptors. The selection also considers wide dispersive worker or consumer use. The evaluation may also result in the identification of other concerns on the substances.
