EASA was informed of this recall notice on July 31, 2019 and assessed that it falls within the scope of applicability of its existing SIB 2017-01, which contains general recommendations regarding the transport by air, as cargo and by passengers, of damaged, recalled, defective or potentially hazardous lithium batteries, including those contained in equipment.

In SIB 2017-01, EASA recommends that operators inform crews, passengers and staff about any restrictions and limitations on carrying such devices on board. If such a device is taken on board, the passenger is required to keep it switched off and not use or charge the device. Passengers should also be reminded to inform cabin crew immediately when a device is damaged, hot, produces smoke, is lost or falls into the seat structure.
