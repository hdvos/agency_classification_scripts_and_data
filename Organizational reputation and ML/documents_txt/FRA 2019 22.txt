FRA participated in the EEA and Norway Grants Financial Mechanism Office’s second International Partner Organisation coordination meeting in Brussels on 27 June. 

The meeting allowed for discussions on the role of the OECD, the Council of Europe and FRA in the design and set-up of programmes under the EEA and Norway Grants’ Financial Mechanism 2014-2021 as well as their changing role as the programme cycle enters the implementation phase.
The meeting facilitated cooperation and coordination, and a better understanding of the various roles and responsibilities of the International Partner Organisations and the challenges they face. The possible role of the International Partner Organisations in future programmes was also discussed. Cooperation in the field of communications received specific attention.
The meeting also provided the opportunity for the representatives to present the respective mandates and activities of their organisations to FMO staff, as well as to individually discuss specific aspects of cooperation.
