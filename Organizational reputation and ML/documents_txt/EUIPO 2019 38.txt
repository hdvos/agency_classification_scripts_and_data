The EUIPO is the first EU agency to publish an annual ‘integrated’ report


The EUIPO published its first integrated report detailing the Office’s entire activity for 2018. The release of the Office’s integrated report is also a first of its kind among EU agencies and is a result of its commitment to transparency and accountability, proactively putting these principles into practice.
For the EUIPO, 2018 was a year of continued progress on the Strategic Plan 2020 (SP2020), while it dealt with a fluctuating, but still strong, demand for EU trade marks and designs and continued to expand its work on cooperation activities and aspects of enforcement.
Successfully concluding the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)’s validation process for the third consecutive year is proof that the Office is heading in the right sustainable direction. As a significant achievement in the EUIPO’s corporate reporting — as highlighted in the European Court of Auditors’ most recent review — integrated reporting provides a more holistic overview which enables a clearer understanding of the value created, the non-financial resources and the links between the operational functions that contribute to success. As such, the Office’s integrated report delivers a comprehensive view of its global value creation, gained from its organisational, human, economic, environmental, social and relational dimensions. Ultimately, the report provides a deeper insight into the fundamental building blocks that underline the Office’s value creation, and the clarity gained should result in more informed decision-making in the future.
The document also provides a complete and refreshed overview of the Office’s level of reporting on the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the EU Directive on non-financial reporting, its performance and its strategic vision. Finally, each stage of its value chain is illustrated by the Office’s lines of action, projects and stakeholders.
