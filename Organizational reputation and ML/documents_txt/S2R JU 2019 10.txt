Vienna, 18 March 2019 – The Austrian Infrastructure Minister Nobert Hofer welcomed an illustrious group of European and international experts to discuss the important role of satellite-based positioning technology for the future of the European railway sector today in Vienna. While traditional and ageing technologies are being gradually phased out, satellite technology opens up new possibilities for providing a scalable solution for railway positioning and increasing the safety of rail transport. It also supports cost efficiency for rail infrastructure and promises to become a global success for the exportation of European technologies such as the European Train Control System (ETCS).
