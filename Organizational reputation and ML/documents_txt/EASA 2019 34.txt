The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) would like to inform third country operators on the importance of adhering to filed flight plans in the European airspace. Unless there are safety reasons, the adherence to the filed flight plan is of great importance to keep the existing European network system safe and predictable.

For that purpose, EASA has developed a note for the attention of Aircraft Operators and Air Traffic Services (ATS), which is attached to this communication. Please distribute this note further within your organisation, to ensure that filed flight plans are adhered to, resulting in a decrease of the safety risks.
