H.E. MARC ANDRIES M. CALCOEN, AMBASSADOR OF BELGIUM IN SPAIN AND ANDORRA, VISITS SATCEN
On 22 October 2019, H.E. Marc Andries M. CALCOEN, Ambassador of Belgium in Spain and Andorra, visited SatCen and was briefed on the Centre's activities.
He was welcomed by SatCen Director Amb. Sorin Ducaru and Deputy Director Giuseppe D’Amico and then introduced to other SatCen Managers. Amb. Ducaru gave an introduction to SatCen activities and governance, also covering the Centre’s strategic development perspective. As examples of product requests from Member States to SatCen, Head of Operations Adriano Baptista mentioned some related to migration, evacuation of citizens from a crisis area and situational awareness for the participation of a Member State in an EU operation.
The importance of integration, customization and development of tools for the analysis of satellite imagery was also discussed. Head of IT Alexis Letulier explained how artificial intelligence eases the work of SatCen analysts by scanning huge areas to detect objects of iterests, so that the analysts can focus on the analysis itself and not waste unnecessary time on detection.
Thereafter, H.E. Marc Andries M. CALCOEN was led to the Operations Division where imagery analysts showed examples of SatCen products.
H.E. Marc Andries M. CALCOEN has been Ambassador of Belgium in Spain and Andorra since 23 January 2017.
