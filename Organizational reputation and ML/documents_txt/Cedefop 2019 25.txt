Iceland: fairs and competitions to enhance VET attractiveness 

In March, Skills Iceland held its biannual VET fair for primary education learners, and a national exhibition in 30 different trades for current VET learners. Primary education learners attending received information from 33 different VET and tertiary-level schools and were encouraged to test their skills in masonry, hair styling, carpentry, catering, blood pressure checking, car repairing, etc., while VET learners demonstrated skills acquired through learning. The event was supported by the education minister.
A special family day was also organised which primary education learners could attend with their parents or other family members and during which they continued learning, testing their skills and entertaining themselves with a BMX Bros bicycle act, comedians and ice-cream.
Over 4 000 people attended this family day, making the event a success if one considers that the local population is just over 120 000 people.
Apart from primary education learners, competitions for actual VET learners took place who participated in hundreds in 30 different trades. The Minister for Education, Science and Culture visited the event twice and tried her skills at masonry – ensuring maximum media coverage. Combining competitions with entertainment is a recipe for success for such events.
