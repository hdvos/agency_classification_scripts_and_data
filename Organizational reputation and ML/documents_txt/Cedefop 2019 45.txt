Romania: VET learners ranked third at the international forestry skills competition

The ‘Bucovina’ Câmpulung Moldovenesc forestry college learners ranked third among their peers from 17 countries [1] at the international competition in forestry skills in Sweden in May 2019.
The competition included individual and team tasks in felling, limbing, precision, combined cuts, fitting, maths, first aid and green competences (knowledge of green species, wood, animals, pests, diseases and ways to prevent them).
The short‐term goal of the competition was presenting the latest achievements in theory and practice of logging techniques, logging machinery tools and logger safety equipment, and comparing these internationally.
The competition has also raised vocational education and training (VET) learner awareness of common concerns such as:
preservation of forest and wildlife resources;
change, wise use and maintenance of resources in the context of societal values;
mastery of technical skills;
the importance of communication, teamwork, problem-solving and decision-making.
It was organised by the network of Europea International, an association working for the development of VET in the green sector with more than 1 000 schools involved across Europe. This sector covers a wide field of professions in agriculture, horticulture, forestry, etc. Europea Romania has been a full member of the network since December 2010, representing 22 schools in natural resources and environment protection.
