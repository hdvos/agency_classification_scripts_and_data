29 March 2019
All lights at CEPOL will be switched off on Saturday from 8:30 to 9:30 pm as we are one of the 40 EU institutions and bodies joining the WWF Earth Hour 2019!
This year the campaign aims to spark conversations on ‘why nature matters’, and hopes to encourage people to value biodiversity in their daily lives.
From the Sydney Opera House to the Eiffel Tower and the Berlaymont building in Brussels, thousands of iconic landmarks will join millions of people to show their support for the fight against climate change and the conservation of the natural world. A few everyday actions are enough to actively contribute to sustainable development: just turn off the light or the PC or other device you're using when you leave the room.
