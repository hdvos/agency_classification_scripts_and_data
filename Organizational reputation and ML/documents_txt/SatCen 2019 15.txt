CPCC DIRECTOR AND CIVILIAN OPERATIONS COMMANDER, LIEUTENANT-GENERAL VICENZO COPPOLA, VISITS SATCEN
On 21 June 2019, the Director of the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) and Civilian Operations Commander of the European External Action Service, Lieutenant-General Vicenzo Coppola, visited SatCen together with Mr. Giorgio Porzio, Senior Policy Advisor at the CPCC.
He was welcomed by SatCen Director Amb Sorin Ducaru and Deputy Director Giuseppe D'Amico. After being given a general overview of the Centre, he was led to the Operation Division, where imagery analysts explained in detail what SatCen does in support of the EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM) in Georgia, the EU Training Mission in Mali, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and Frontex. They also showed the GeohuB, an interactive platform for the exchange of information within a mission or operation, already used by EUMM Georgia and EU NAVFOR Med Sophia ().
Lt. General Vicenzo Coppola found the information very useful and saw a clear interest for an increased use of SatCen services for EU civilian missions. "What SatCen does is extremely important for us" he said to SatCen Director Amb Ducaru, who stated that "For SatCen, increasing our support to EU missions and operations is a priority".
Mr Coppola was appointed in September 2018 by the High-Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini as the new Civilian Operations Commander. He served in his previous function as the Deputy Commanding General of the Italian Carabinieri. He commands a professional career of 40 years in Italy, EU headquarters in Brussels and several international assignments. Mr Coppola holds a Master in Strategic Studies and has been commended with the Cross of the Italian Military Order, the highest Italian military commendation.
