‘Twenty Years after Tampere’: Statement of Eurojust President Ladislav Hamran
15/10/2019
Today, exactly twenty years ago in Tampere, Finland, the European heads of state and government took the important decision to step up judicial cooperation between EU Member States. With this decision, they gave the green light for Eurojust - initially starting in a few offices in Brussels but now operating from The Hague, the City of Peace and Justice. In those twenty years, we have taken great steps to combat cross-border crime and improve cooperation on a daily basis.
Eurojust has become the natural partner in judicial cooperation for prosecutors and investigative judges in all Member States and many third countries. At the request of the Member States, we take on more and more cases each year to get #JusticeDone across the European Union.
This ever-growing cooperation is the result of the continuous hard work of many: judicial practitioners in the Member States, our partners in the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, the European Commission and other EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies, our National Members and liaison prosecutors and all our staff members here in The Hague.
We do our work with passion and pride, in the interest of the European citizens and with the goal of creating a safer Europe. I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone for their support. Rest assured that you can count on us to continue our important mission.
Ladislav Hamran
President of Eurojust
