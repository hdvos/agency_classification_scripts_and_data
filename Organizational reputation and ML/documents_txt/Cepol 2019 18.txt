On 30 October, CEPOL's Head of Operations, Mailis Pukonen, attended a high-level conference organised by Frontex in Warsaw as a panelist in a discussion on Strategic Border management beyond borders: How can innovation and technology support it?
While addressing the topic, she stressed:
Too often new technologies are discussed in isolation from training and educational aspect. 
Technology is only as good as its user. At the end of every tool, there is a person, human being to read the data, to interpret it and to act upon it. 
In order to keep up with the challenge people need to acquire high level technological skills.
The International Border Police Conference provided a valuable platform for the international border management community to come together to freely exchange knowledge and experience among the community as a whole
The aim was to strengthen the network of the international border management authorities to bring about closer operational cooperation to effectively address the many challenges they face.
Some of the key topics discussed were balancing openness with security and tackling the threat of terrorism and cross-border crimes; managing resources and change; harnessing innovative approaches and technologies – all whilst ensuring the mobility of legitimate travellers and business around the world.
