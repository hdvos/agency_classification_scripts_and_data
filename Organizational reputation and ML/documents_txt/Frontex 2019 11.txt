2019-10-16
In September, the number of detections of illegal border crossings on Europe’s main migratory routes rose 14% from the previous month to more than 17 200 due to higher arrivals on the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean. Despite the growing numbers in recent months, the total on all European migratory routes for the first three quarters of 2019 was 19% lower at around 88 200.
