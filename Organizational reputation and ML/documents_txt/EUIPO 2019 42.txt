Long lists of goods and/or services in EUTM applications


The Office has recently observed a trend where certain EUTM applications contain unusually long lists of goods and/or services. Where normally the average number of terms applied for lies within a range of 60 to 100, these big applications contain 50 times the average number of terms. There has even been a considerable increase in the number of applications that have exceeded 10 000 terms.

a higher risk of classification deficiencies;
delays in publication and registration of the EUTM;
an increased risk of conflicts with other trade marks (oppositions);
an increased risk of a trade mark being eventually cancelled because of a similarity to an earlier mark or non-use of all the registered goods and/or services.
In addition, the Office strongly recommends the use of the  to help you create your list of goods and/or services.
