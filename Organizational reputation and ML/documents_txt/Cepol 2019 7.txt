01 October 2019
This week (30 September to 2 October) the 7th CEPOL National Units’ (CNU) meeting is taking place at our premises in Budapest.
The meeting provides a great opportunity not only to update our colleagues from across Europe on common achievements or future plans but also to increase efficiency of our cooperation and provide a chance to discuss feedback face-to-face in a number of organised workshop sessions.
Reform of the CEPOL Knowledge Centres, CEPOL 2020 portfolio, results of the 2019 training needs analysis, launch of CEPOL’s new online Law Enforcement Education platform (LEEd) and an update on the CEPOL Exchange Programme and capacity building projects in third countries, have been main topics on the Agenda.
