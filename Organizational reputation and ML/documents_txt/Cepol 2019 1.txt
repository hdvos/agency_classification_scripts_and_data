18 September 2019
On Tuesday, 17 September, CEPOL's Executive Director Dr h. c. Detlef Schröder had the honour to open the CEPOL Residential Course organised by the Finnish Police in Helsinki on the topic of Police Service 2.0.
The course as an activity organised within remits of the Finnish presidency in the Council of the EU aims to increase professional skills of law enforcement leaders, policy specialists, and strategists in strategic analysis, strategic thinking, and in the design of service innovations. It has been designed to encourage "thinking outside of the box".
CEPOL's Executive Director commented on the event:
"How can you make experienced officers critically reflect on their ways of strategic thinking and planning? Our Finish partners developed a very interesting model to do this! The Finish University Police College is currently delivering the CEPOL Course Police Service 2.0 in the frame of their current Presidency of the Council of the European Union. This is a very innovative training approach by using a scenario-based methodology to direct the participants towards new ways of strategic thinking. It was a great pleasure for me to open this event and to be engaged in discussions with the engaged and motivated participants.".
