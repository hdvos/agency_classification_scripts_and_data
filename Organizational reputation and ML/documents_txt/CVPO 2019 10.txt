Public consultation on the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in third countries
21 March 2019Communication

The European Commission (DG Trade) has launched a public consultation to gather information on the protection and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) in non-EU countries. 

The aim of this public consultation is to identify third countries in which intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and enforcement is a high concern, as well as to update the European Commission's list of the 'priority countries.'

This consultation will be one of the tools used by the Commission to focus its efforts on the priority countries and help on specific areas of concern to improve IPR protection and enforcement worldwide. The results will also let right holders to be aware of potential risks to their Plant Variety Rights (PVR) when doing business in non-EU countries.

The CPVO is supporting this initiative and encouraging all its stakeholders to contribute by filling the Commission's survey by 26 May 2019.
