World IP Day – IP and Sport


April 26 marks World IP Day, organised by the  (WIPO) which this year takes as its theme intellectual property and sport.
World IP Day is celebrated globally by public and private sector organisations to mark the contribution that intellectual property has on our daily lives, and its importance to our economies and societies as a whole.
The sports sector is an important economic motor for the EU, with  showing that it contributes EUR 294 billion to the EU’s GDP. The total employment generated by sports activities in the EU is estimated at 7.3 million, equivalent to 3.5% of all jobs in the EU.
Intellectual property rights are key to protecting innovation in the sports sector.  shows that the sports goods manufacture sector loses EUR 338 million each year due to the presence of counterfeit goods in the marketplace.
To highlight the link between sports and IP, and the importance of IP protection in this sector, intellectual property offices across the EU and beyond will be carrying out different awareness events at national and regional level. In Thailand, the  project, for which the EUIPO is the implementing agency, cooperated with the Spanish football league (La Liga) to organise an exhibition underlining how IP rights help support and maintain sporting leagues across the world.
