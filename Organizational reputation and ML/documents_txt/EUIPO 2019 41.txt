User Satisfaction Survey tool implemented in Jordan


As of 5 August 2019, the Jordanian Industrial Property Protection Directorate under the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Supply () has implemented the User Satisfaction Survey (USS) tool.
The USS tool provides participating offices with a single, common approach to carrying out surveys among users of intellectual property offices.
This implementation is part of the activities undertaken under Line of Action 4 of EUIPO’s Strategic Plan 2020, and part of the extension of tools developed through the European Union Intellectual Property Network (EUIPN) to IP offices outside the European Union.
As a result of this implementation, there are now 9 offices outside the EU which have implemented the USS tool.
