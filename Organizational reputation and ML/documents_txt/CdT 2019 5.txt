2019 International Translation Day
‘Translation and Indigenous Languages’ is the theme promoted by the International Federation of Translators (FIT) to mark International Translation Day 2019. The event is traditionally celebrated on 30 September, the feast of St Jerome who is the patron saint of translators.
As the FIT reminds us all on its website, ‘interpreters of indigenous languages give native speakers a chance to fully participate in cultural and political life of society and offer equality of access to basic services such as health care, education, information and justice in their mother tongue. Equality of access, along with freedom of thought, expression and personal opinion, are freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
Languages, and therefore translation, interpreting and terminology, underpin the human rights and fundamental freedoms crucial to sustainable development, inclusive governance, peace and social equity.’
We, at the Translation Centre, welcome FIT’s statement and, on this special day, wish our in-house language teams, our network of external language service providers and all those working in the translation community to ensure that the multiple content produced by the EU agencies, institutions and other EU bodies reaches its target audience a very happy Translation Day!
