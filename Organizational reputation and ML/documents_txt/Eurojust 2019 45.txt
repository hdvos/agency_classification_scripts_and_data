Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri re-elected as Vice-President of Eurojust
05/11/2019
Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, National Member for Germany at Eurojust, has unanimously been re-elected as Vice-President today. Mr Meyer-Cabri has served as Vice-President since 2016.
Mr Meyer-Cabri stated: ‘I am humbled by the trust colleagues put in me and I will strive to honour this trust in the years to come. Improving the fight against cross-border crime, protecting the European Union and increasing European security require strengthening Eurojust’s operational capacities. Eurojust’s ever-increasing number of cases proves the need and demand for cooperation and coordination by the national prosecution offices. This demand can, however, only be guaranteed if proper funding is provided by the EU legislators. Under the leadership of the President of Eurojust, I will work tirelessly to ensure this in the interest of protection and security for EU citizens.’
Since becoming the National Member for Germany in September 2014, Mr Meyer-Cabri has advanced his office into the one with the highest caseload at Eurojust. Before joining Eurojust, Mr Meyer-Cabri was Deputy Director General and Head of the Office for EU Justice Policy and International Cooperation at the German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection in Berlin. He has served as a Legal Counsellor at the German Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels, the German Patent and Trademark Office and the Office of Public Prosecution of Berlin. Mr Meyer-Cabri studied at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, the London School of Economics and the Free University of Berlin.
