IP Tertulia at the EUIPO Luxembourg Office


On Wednesday 19 June 2019, the EUIPO Luxembourg Office, in collaboration with the Intellectual Property Office in Luxembourg and Institut de la Propriété Intellectuelle de Luxembourg (IPIL), hosts an IP Tertulia on the topic of ‘Requirement for clarity and precision for goods and services in trade mark applications and registrations’.
Three speakers will address different aspects of the applicability of the law and case-law relating to the requirement for such clarity and precision:
Charles-Henry Massa (Référendaire Cabinet Judge M. Kancheva, General Court, EU)
Marie-Christine Simon (Office Freylinger)
Benedetta Marsicola (Etude Molitor)
This series of roundtables (‘tertulias’ in Spanish) was launched with the goal of gathering intellectual property professionals and experts in the Luxembourg region. This is the second IP Tertulia organised at the Luxembourg Office, following a  held in October 2018.
The IP Tertulia will take place at the EUIPO Luxembourg Office (2 rue Jean Monnet, Luxembourg) at 19:00. Given the limited availability of places, attendance at this event is by invitation only.
