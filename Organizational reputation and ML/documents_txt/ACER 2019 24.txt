â€‹The European Union's revised Electricity Regulation established this year that the Agency should provide a technical guidance for the calculation of CO2 emissions in generation capacity, in the frame of Capacity Mechanisms. For that purpose, the Agency launches today a public consultation on the draft Opinion providing such guidance.

In case of resource adequacy concerns, Capacity Mechanisms are temporary measures taken by EU Member States to ensure that electricity supply can match demand, in times of expected system stress. 

In this context, the Agency's Opinion lays the foundation for a harmonised introduction of emission limits for generation capacity to participate in Capacity Mechanisms: an essential tool to limit the impact of Capacity Mechanisms on EU climate objectives.

In order to gather views and information, the Agency seeks comments of interested stakeholders, including regulatory authorities, capacity providers and transmission system operators, on the draft Opinion.

All interested parties are invited to provide comments by 22 October 2019
