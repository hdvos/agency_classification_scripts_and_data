New momentum for partnerships with local governments
Rights areas:


FRA took part in the UN OHCHR meeting on local governments and human rights on 17 June in Geneva.Â 

The meeting allowed practices and challenges faced by cities in human rights to be shared. New avenues for cooperation between international human rights actors and local governments were discussed.
These included developing guidelines and capacity building for cities or strengthening the initiative of human rights cities. In this context, FRA highlighted the opportunities to develop a coalition of partners in Europe to support European human rights cities in further developing human rights standards building upon successful practices from cities such as Vienna, Graz, Utrecht or Barcelona.
The results of the discussion will contribute to the upcoming UN Report on fostering cooperation with local governments and local actors on human rights that will be presented to the Human Rights Council in September 2019.
