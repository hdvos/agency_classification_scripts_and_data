30 September 2019
It was with deep sorrow that we got the news of the sad demise, of Ilkka Laitinen, former Chief of the Finnish Border Guard.
On the behalf of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) we express condolence for the loss.
Ilkka’s has been a devoted European and his work towards protection of the external Finnish and European borders have been respected and admired by the community across the Union. As the first Executive Director of , with his dedication and labour, he laid foundations to what shall be a truly European Border and Coast Guard. We lost today not just man who served a safer Europe but a true colleague, cooperation partner, friend and passionate individual.
Our collective hearts are heavy with sympathy towards his family, friends and colleagues.
