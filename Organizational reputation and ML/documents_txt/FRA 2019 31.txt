FRA contributed to the side event ‘Human Rights and the 2030 Agenda: Leaving No One Behind while Accelerating SDG Implementation’ organized at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) 2019 on Sustainable Development on the theme of ‘Empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality’ from 11-16 July 2019. 

Speakers included the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the Permanent Representatives of Denmark and Chile to the United Nations, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; UN-DESA, the Danish Institute for Human Rights; and the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions.
The side event was attended by around 150 participants and focused on how to effectively integrate a human rights-based approach to SDG planning, implementation, monitoring and review looking in particular at equality, non-discrimination and at ways of identifying and reaching those at risk of being left behind highlighting the importance of disaggregated data. FRA’s intervention emphasised the need for disaggregated data on the poorest, most marginalised and discriminated groups to improve policies addressing them - not only in the global South, but also in developed countries as described in the FRA focus .
FRA also mentioned the outcomes of the Intersessional meeting of the Human Rights Council on ‘Human Rights and the 2030 Agenda’ of 16 January 2019 for which FRA Director Michael O’Flaherty was the official rapporteur – see his . A  is available on UN Web TV
