BBI JU LAUNCHES 18 NEW PROJECTS, CELEBRATES ITS 100TH PROJECT 
10 May 2019
The Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) grant agreements for 18 new projects under the 2018 Call for proposals are now signed, bringing the total number of BBI JU-funded projects to 100. The newly signed projects will tackle a range of different topics from unlocking the potential of biodegradable packaging to using mealworms to produce animal feed.
The new projects grant € 85 944 261 to 224 beneficiaries originating from 27 different countries. They are divided into 9 Research & Innovation Action projects, 3 Coordination and Support Action projects, 5 Demonstration Action projects and one Flagship Action project. The last one is the first BBI JU flagship biorefinery in France, which will produce animal feed from mealworms on an industrial scale.
Announcing the start of these new projects, Philippe Mengal, BBI JU’s Executive Director commented: ‘All of us in BBI JU, together with our founding partners the European Commission and the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC), are excited to see these 18 new projects starting. Once again, these consortia bring together primary production and processing industries, consumer brands, SMEs, research and technology centres and universities, demonstrating BBI JU’s ability to connect previously unconnected actors so they can successfully scale up and commercialise bio-based products. Today, as we celebrate 100 projects in our portfolio, we can be very proud of the fact that our projects continue to address key gaps in the deployment of the bio-based industries and are delivering , bringing the bio-based products closer to EU citizens.’
The BBI JU projects are funded under the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 programme and bring together researchers from several European centres of excellence – companies, research institutes or universities – to develop new technologies and products, and bring them to maturity or even commercial level. The bio-based sector can work more coherently through measures that bring in feedstock suppliers as partners in the value chains, develop biorefinery technologies and processes, raise business-to-business demand, and promote customer awareness about innovative bio-based products and applications.
