Finland: increasing compulsory education age and merging VET and general education governance 

In 2021, compulsory education age will be extended from 16 to 18 according to the government programme. This will apply to all programmes at upper secondary level.
Issues concerning general upper secondary education and vocational upper secondary education were consequently united under a single department – the Department for general upper secondary education and vocational education and training – at the Ministry of Education and Culture in November 2019.
This arrangement aims to strengthen the cooperation between general and vocational upper secondary education required by both VET and general upper secondary education acts.
