EIOPA reviews the use of Big Data Analytics in motor and health insuranceÂ 
Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published its report on Big Data Analytics in motor and health insurance.
Data processing has historically been at the very core of the business of insurance undertakings, which is rooted strongly in data-led statistical analysis. Data has always been collected and processed to inform underwriting decisions, price policies, settle claims and prevent fraud. There has long been a pursuit of more granular datasets and predictive models, such that the relevance of Big Data Analytics for the sector is no surprise.
