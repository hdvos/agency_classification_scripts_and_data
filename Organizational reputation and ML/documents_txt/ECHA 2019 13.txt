ECHA reorganises to help take on new tasks and face future challenges
ECHA/NR/19/02
 
The reorganisation aims to support the implementation of ECHA’s new strategy, step up work in key areas, allow efficient and flexible ways of working, and enable ECHA to take on more responsibilities.
 
Helsinki, 10 January 2019 – Together with the revision of ECHA’s strategy, the Agency has re-aligned its organisation to help it meet future challenges. The new organisational structure entered into force on 1 January 2019, after the adoption of the strategy by the Management Board in December 2018.
The new structure reflects ECHA’s broad capacity to implement chemicals legislation, including information submission; dissemination, data mining, grouping and prioritising chemicals; assessing chemical hazards and exposure; risk management and socio-economic analysis.
“Our vision is to be the centre of knowledge on the sustainable management of chemicals, serving a wide range of EU policies and global initiatives, for the benefit of citizens and the environment. Together with our partners we will continue to work effectively for the safe use of chemicals”, says ECHA’s Executive Director Bjorn Hansen.
While aiming to ensure continuity of operations, re-organising ECHA allows the Agency to focus on its strategic priorities, work more efficiently and flexibly, and make the best use of staff competences to take on new tasks.
One new director and a number of new heads of unit will be appointed in the new organisation. The recruitment process is currently ongoing.
