​​ACER publishes today a decision – based on the EU Regulation on System Operation in electricity - on the methodology for assessing the relevance of assets for outage coordination. This methodology  sets out harmonised rules for all synchronous areas  and describes in particular the influence computation method. The methodology was originally developed by all TSOs and submitted for approval to National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) before being referred to the Agency. The Agency introduced minor amendments to the all TSOs' proposal in order to improve its legal clarity.

Background

In December 2018, the Agency became competent to decide on the methodology for assessing the relevance of assets for outage coordination. In January and February 2019, the Agency consulted all interested stakeholders on this issue (find out more here).

All NRAs unanimously decided that the Agency should adopt a decision on the all TSOs' proposal for assessing the relevance of assets for outage coordination.

The Agency amended the methodology in few instances where the methodology was unclear and with regard to the implementation planning. The most notable amendment to the methodology is related to the cycle for the re-assessment of assets for outage coordination, which was reduced to 3 years.
