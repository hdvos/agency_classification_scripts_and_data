ECSEL JU re-elects Governing Board Chair 
At its Governing Board meeting of 26 November 2019, the ECSEL Joint Undertaking Governing Board re-elected Dr. Sabine Herlitschka as their Chairperson, for a period of one year starting on March 1st 2020. 
Dr Herlitschka, presently Chief Executive Officer of Infineon Technologies Austria AG, was first elected to chair the ECSEL JU Governing Board in February 2018. In this role, she has actively emphasised that Electronic Components and Systems not only is a key enabling technology area but provides essential answers to major global challenges. “Taking climate change - the climate crisis - as an example, our society faces a huge challenge, a challenge where the output of our collective effort as ECSEL has real positive impact by significantly increasing energy efficiency, thus reducing CO2 emissions drastically.” 
In her acceptance speech, Dr. Herlitschka stated: “We jointly have to further develop ECSEL in view of the new Horizon Europe Programme and the importance of its Key Digital Technologies. This is even more important when considering the current global developments, particularly in China and the U.S. Europe has a strong role to play in Electronic Components and Systems, and the ECSEL Governing Board can be instrumental on this way.”
