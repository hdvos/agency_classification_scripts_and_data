15 May 2019
Press Release






Europol is calling for the best law enforcement photos from Europe and beyond. Today, we are launching CAPTURE 2019, this year’s edition of our annual photo competition packed with new features: three categories – three winners:
Making Europe safer: Show us how police officers carry out their job on a daily basis to fight  crime: training exercises,  manoeuvres, law enforcement pictured in abstract and artistic form.
Cybercrime: cyber criminals, malware, payment card fraud, Internet of Things (IoT), digital forensics, cyber-attacks. We are looking for pictures showing us how cybercrime in all its forms affect our lives.
Diversity and inclusion: This section is about celebrating diversity in law enforcement. Send us pictures portraying the diversity of the women and men dedicating their life to make Europe a safer place, or the work of the officers in service of diverse societies.
Closing date: 15 August 2019
 
Are you a law enforcement officer and do you think you have what it takes to become a professional photographer for one day and show us the challenging but gratifying work of the police?  You can send us up to five pictures - one of them might land you the opportunity of a free trip to the Netherlands if you are one of the lucky winners.

Entries will be used in Europol publications, including calendars, social media and other communication products, as we did with the previous winners:
