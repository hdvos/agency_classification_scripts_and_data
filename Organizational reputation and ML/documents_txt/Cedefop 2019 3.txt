Romania: networking partnerships for quality assurance in VETÂ 

A total of 10 new VET school networks were set up by the National Centre for TVET Development between April 2019 and March 2021 to strengthen institutional capacity and develop the quality assurance culture in initial VET.
The networks offer qualifications in the following economic sectors:
agriculture;
industrial chemistry, environmental protection and food industry;
commerce/economics (two networks);
electrics and electromechanics;
electronics, automatisation, telecommunication;
textile industry and leather processing;
mechanics;
tourism;
forestry, wood processing and manufacture of wood products.
Each network comprises around six initial VET schools, each with an executive team and a coordinator. Networks develop activity plans, including cooperation activities, intended outcomes and schedule.
Cooperation activities include peer learning, peer review, personnel information seminars, activities aiming to promote VET to the main stakeholders, etc. To strengthen cooperation, each school from each network organises joint activities inviting all network partner schools to disseminate their best practices regarding successful solutions for a quality assurance system at provider level, considering planning, monitoring, collecting evidence and assessment of the quality assurance process in their school.
Network activities implemented in October 2019 were part of the European vocational skills week, aiming to raise initial VET attractiveness for learners, companies, community representatives, parents and teachers.
The networking activity is part of the EQAVET-NRP-RO project.
