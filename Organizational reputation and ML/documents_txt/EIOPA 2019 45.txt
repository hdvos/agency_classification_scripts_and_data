Following the publication on 6 June 2019 of the end-May 2019 risk-free-rate technical information, the Icelandic Krona (ISK) government bond yields used for calculating the relevant risk-free interest rate term structures were incorrect.
Therefore, EIOPA recalculated the risk-free interest rate term structures for the ISK to ensure that insurance and reinsurance undertakings can base their calculation of technical provisions on the correct technical information.
The technical information related to all other currencies remains unchanged.
This RFR information has been calculated on the basis of the last updated documents published on EIOPA's website.
Background
Technical information relating to risk-free interest rate (RFR) term structures is used for the calculation of the technical provisions for (re)insurance obligations.
In line with the Solvency II Directive, EIOPA publishes technical information relating to RFR term structures on a monthly basis via a dedicated section on EIOPA's Website also containing the release calendar for 2019, the RFR Technical Documentation, the RFR coding and Frequently Asked Questions.
With this publication, EIOPA ensures consistent calculation of technical provisions across Europe.
