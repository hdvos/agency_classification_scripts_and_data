The EU is helping Georgia to modernise its education and labour policies
29 OCT 2019
European Union has launched a new four-year program to support the reforms of vocational education and training and labor market policies in Georgia.
The focus of the support scheme is on providing people with relevant skills through modern vocational education courses throughout Georgia.
This new program is based on the previous EU-Georgia Employment and Vocational and Training program which already created modern and relevant education courses and set up a system that helped over 30.000 Georgians to find a job.
The launch of the scheme took place in Gldani Vocational School, a pioneer in providing relevant skills to people and modernizing the teaching and learning methods.
