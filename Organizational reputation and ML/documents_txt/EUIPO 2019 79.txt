ID5 Mid-Term Meeting in Tokyo


The Japan Patent Office (JPO) hosted the ID5 Mid-Term Meeting in Tokyo on 24 June 2019.
The ID5 partner offices shared their progress on a number of cooperation projects. The EUIPO reported on the progress made in the two projects it leads, ‘Product Indications’ and ‘Forecasting’, as well as a project it co-leads with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) on Quality Management.
Updates were also given by the ID5 partner offices on new projects that were adopted at the 2018 Annual Meeting, including ‘3D Printing’, ‘Admissibility of Internet Information as Legitimate Discloser’, ‘Design Patent Quality Management’, ‘ID5 Recommended Design Practices’ and ‘Remedies for Design Patent Infringement’.
The ID5 Partners also discussed new concepts for projects to be considered for adoption at the 2019 Annual Meeting. In this context, the EUIPO proposed projects on Image Search and Risk Management.
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) was present as an observer, as it had been at previous ID5 Annual Meetings.
ID5 is the multilateral cooperation forum, inaugurated in 2015, which allows the five largest design Offices, the European Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the Japan Patent Office (JPO), the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) and the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) to seek cooperation synergies for the benefit of users in the field of design registration. The ID5 Annual Meetings have been held since 2015. You can find out more at
