EASA has published the Opinion 05/2019 “Standard scenarios for UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) operations in the ‘specific’ category” which is proposing amendments to the new European Drone Rules. The objective of the Opinion is to increase the cost-effectiveness for drone operators, manufacturers and competent authorities, and to improve the harmonisation of drone operations throughout Europe.

The Opinion covers two standard scenarios to facilitate some UAS operations posing a low risk in the specific category. For those, drone operators will be allowed to just send a declaration to the respective authority instead of applying and waiting for an authorisation. The standard scenarios include Urban VLOS (Visual Line of Sight) and Rural BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) above control ground area operations.

The Opinion will be transformed in a legislative act by the EU Commission and adopted after positive vote by the EU member States expected in February 2020.
