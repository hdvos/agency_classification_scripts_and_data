Bursaries for students from ENP countries for the 2020 European Drugs Summer School
 
Lisbon  17.12.2019
Professionals, academics or experts from European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries will have an opportunity to participate in the European Drugs Summer School (EDSS) in 2020, thanks to five bursaries being offered through the EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD) project (1). The three-year EU-funded project — launched by the EMCDDA in January 2019 — supports national and regional readiness in the ENP area to identify and respond to drug-related health and security threats.

The 2020 EDSS — organised by the EMCDDA and the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) —will take place from 29 June to 10 July 2020 in Lisbon. EMCDDA scientific experts, leading academics, guest speakers, policymakers and professionals will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in the drugs field — both in Europe and beyond. Under the general theme ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’, the 2020 EDSS will focus on hepatitis C.

The bursaries will cover flights, accommodation and EDSS fees. The course is conducted in English and students should have a good written and spoken knowledge of the language.
