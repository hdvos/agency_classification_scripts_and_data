The Agency has published a decision setting the common methodology for the calculation of cross-border capacities in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia (the Core region) for the single day-ahead and intraday electricity market coupling. The adopted methodologies establish a flow-based capacity calculation approach for 13 Member States mentioned as well as  16 Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and 19 bidding zone borders.

The implementation of the methodologies will follow several steps from December 2020 to December 2022, followed by a significant review of 18 months after their implementation. Once implemented, they are expected to increase significantly the cross-zonal capacities between the relevant TSOs and Member States and address the current problems with regard to discrimination between internal and cross-zonal electricity trading. The new methodologies will also significantly increase the transparency and understanding of how TSOs translate the technical capability of the electricity network infrastructure into cross-zonal capacities that market participants can use to trade electricity across the borders of Member States.​
