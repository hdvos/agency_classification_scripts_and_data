22/11/2019
Interoperability, innovation and diversity and inclusion on top of the agenda for the Heads the EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies meeting at Europol
On 22 November, the Heads of the nine EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies met at Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. The discussions focused on the implementation of the New Strategic Agenda 2019-2024, the state-of-play of the interoperability project and the common efforts in reinforcing diversity and inclusion in the workplace.  
 
Europol hosted their annual meeting in the framework of its 2019 chair of the JHA agencies’ network. During its chair, Europol has also organised five expert meetings on information technologies and cybersecurity, diversity and inclusion, media relations, training, and data protection. 
 
The outcome of the meetings that took place under Europol’s chair will serve for the drafting of a joint strategic report with recommendations for the EU Council on the future Internal Security Strategy. 
The different areas of cooperation and subjects relevant to JHA agencies discussed during the meeting and throughout the Europol chair in 2019 clearly demonstrate the crucial role of the agencies in the EU area of justice, security and freedom. 
 
While each and every agency is doing its utmost to deliver results according to its respective mandate, there are several horizontal challenges which can be addressed only through even closer inter-agency cooperation.
