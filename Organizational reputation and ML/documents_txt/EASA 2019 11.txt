EASA to open a liaison office in Hungary


EASA will open a liaison office in Hungary under an agreement signed by Minister of Innovation and Technology László Palkovics and EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky to foster cooperation and sharing of know-how.  

The deepening of cooperation between the parties was based on a Memorandum of Understanding concluded between the Ministry of Innovation and Technology and EASA in July 2019. The establishment of the Budapest liaison office will make it possible to reinforce the supervisory activity of the Hungarian Transport Authority based on the sharing of international know-how.
 
The office will be operational in January 2020 with the support of an expert delegated by EASA. Thanks to the agreement, an even higher level of aviation safety can be ensured in Hungary.
