GREENER CARS FOR GREEN TOMATO
A PRIVATE TAXI FIRM IN LONDON NOW BOASTS EUROPE’S LARGEST ZERO EMISSION CORPORATE FLEET WITH MORE HYDROGEN POWERED VEHICLES ADDED THIS MONTH.
The 25 new Toyota Mirais (which means ‘Future’ in Japanese) deployed to Green Tomato Cars will double the size of their hydrogen fleet, taking the total number of hydrogen vehicles to 50, and contribute to cleaner air and sustainable travel across the city. The vehicles use hydrogen fuel cell technology to deliver a range of 300 miles from a three-minute refuelling time and operate 24/7 in London and the surrounding area
Green Tomato Cars, Europe’s first environmentally friendly car service, are part of a pan-European project to demonstrate viable business cases for fleets of fuel cell electric vehicles. ZEFER, part-funded by FCH JU, is a €26 million initiative that will introduce 180 of these vehicles into a combination of taxi, private-hire and police fleets across London, Brussels and Paris.
Bart Biebuyck, FCH JU Executive Director, said: “Today, the air quality in cities is a central issue and the introduction of zero-emission vehicles is a needed shift to decarbonise urban transport. The fleet of 50 hydrogen fuel cell taxis operated by Green Tomato Cars in London is a flagship initiative showing that zero-emission solutions exist, do not change the way taxis are operating, and make economic sense. I trust that other cities in the UK and in Europe will soon realise the benefits of hydrogen mobility.”
