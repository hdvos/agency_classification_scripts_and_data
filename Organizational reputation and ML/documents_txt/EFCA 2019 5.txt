Abuja hosts a PESCAO training session on fisheries control and inspection techniques for Nigerian inspectors
04/10/2019
Twenty fisheries inspectors from Nigeria have participated in the training session  from 2 to 4 October 2019 provided by experts from the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) and the Fisheries Committee for the West Central Gulf of Guinea (FCWC) with the support of national trainers, in the framework of the EU funded project PESCAO.  
The objective of the training was to harmonise and deepen the knowledge of the participants on key legislation, providing a methodology to conduct inspections both at sea and in port. The three-days’ session was based on the structured approach presented in October 2018 during the ‘train-the-trainers’ session at EFCA’s premises in Vigo (Spain) attended by inspectors from 13 Western African countries covered by the project PESCAO for Improved regional fisheries governance in Western Africa. During the training, participants had the opportunity to discuss various technical issues with EFCA and FCWC experts, resulting in a fruitful exchange of experiences and best practices.
The cooperation project PESCAO includes a component aiming to improve the fight against Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing activities in Western Africa, contributing to sustainable fisheries management and the reduction of food insecurity in the region.
