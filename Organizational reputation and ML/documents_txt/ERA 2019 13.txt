ERA issues the first vehicle authorisation decision
5Jul2019
The European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) delivers first vehicle authorisation – three weeks after becoming European authorising entity for rail traffic in Europe. 

In a historic step to break down barriers in Europe, a vehicle authorisation valid in multiple countries has been issued for the first time: the European Union Agency for Railways has granted the first conformity-to-type for thirty freight wagons for operation in all European countries.
‘Thanks to our learning case programme prior to 16th June, and the excellent cooperation between ERA experts and the applicants before and prior to the authorisation process, we are well-prepared to efficiently manage the new applications’, says Josef Doppelbauer, Executive Director of ERA, ‘I’m proud to say that our processes have been running smoothly from day one’.
‘ERA succeeded in taking the decision on this conformity-to-type authorisation well within the legal timeframe of 4 weeks. Considering that this first authorisation is a learning process for all parties involved, I congratulate the experts from the manufacturer and ERA to have managed this so well’ adds Thierry Breyne, Head of the Planning and Approvals Delivery Unit at ERA.
In the first two weeks, ERA received more than 30 valid applications for vehicle authorisations and two applications for single safety certificates, involving most of the countries that have transposed the new legislation in 2019. ERA has assigned dedicated multilingual expert teams to assess each application.
