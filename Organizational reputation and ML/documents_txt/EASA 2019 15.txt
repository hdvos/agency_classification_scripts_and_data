With the aim to enhance aviation safety in Africa, the EU-Africa Safety in Aviation (EU-ASA) project has been launched. This â‚¬ 5 million technical assistance initiative is managed by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) under the umbrella of the Africa-EU Partnership and the Africa-Europe Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs. In the next three years, the project will assist African member states to establish an effective aviation safety oversight system. The EU-ASA project comes at the right time with the establishment of the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) which is one of the 12 flagship projects of the African Union Agenda 2063.

The project includes a set of activities that will provide support on three levels: continental, regional and national. The main goals of the project are to strengthen Regional Safety Oversight Organisations (RSOOs) and assist African States to meet their obligations under the Chicago Convention to establish an effective aviation safety oversight system. This will also contribute to the implementation of the pillar of the SAATM on 'Enhancing Safety and Security'. The main beneficiaries will be the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), the African RSOOs and Regional Accident and Incident Investigation Organisation (RAIO). Direct assistance to some specific African states will also be provided.
