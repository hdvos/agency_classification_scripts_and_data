The latest ECDC work plan reinforces the role of ECDC as a strong and trusted partner for the EU Member States and the European Commission enabling and supporting them in protecting everyone in the EU equitably from communicable diseases.
As priorities, ECDC highlights antimicrobial resistance, vaccine coverage, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals in the area of HIV, TB and hepatitis, preparedness for cross-border health threats, synergic partnerships and monitoring its own performance.
The work plan lists objectives, key outputs and expected results for the Centre’s areas of operation. It is a commitment to delivering on eight strategic objectives:
Provide scientific advice and authoritative information that enables effective decision-making by Member States and the European Commission
Support efficient decision-making by enabling the sharing of evidence and expertise
Support the strengthening of public health infrastructure and processes
Support the strengthening of public health workforce capacity and capability
Timely detect serious cross-border health threats
Coordinate and support the rapid assessment of risks and the identification of options for response
Support national and international response in the field
Prepare for the future by assessing and analysing the potential impact and benefits brought about by technical and scientific advances
The Surveillance Systems Reengineering roadmap, a work which started in 2017, is expected to be in place in 2021 with a newly developed EU/EEA surveillance system – a modern, user-friendly platform for data reporting, analysis, visualisation and dissemination.
Interested parties will find that the format of the document, an EU agency template, makes it easy to identify the activities planned in an area of work and follow up on expected results.
The document also discloses the resources allocated for the period. The Centre plans with 280 staff for the period, while the budget amounts to EUR 59 206 000 in 2019, EUR 60 458 000 in 2020 and EUR 60 458 000 in 2021.
