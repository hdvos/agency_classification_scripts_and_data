Together against anti-Semitism and terror

10 October 2019
We strongly condemn the brutal attacks in the synagogue in Halle on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in Judaism.
We must stand together against anti-Semitism and acts of terror.
Our hearts are with the families of those who were injured, and who died in this horrific act of violence.
The Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training has shared a letter of condolence with the German Minister of Interior.
