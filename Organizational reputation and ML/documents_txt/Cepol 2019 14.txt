23 October 2019
On 23 October, CEPOL's Executive Director, Dr. h. c. Detlef Schröder, welcomed a delegation of high-ranked police officers from Algeria to our premises.
This is the first time an Algerian delegation visited CEPOL's headquarters, and at the same time their first study visit.
CEPOL started a cooperation with Algeria, the biggest country in Africa, in 2018. Thus far, four CEPOL residential activities were organised in Algeria and 85 law enforcement officers were trained.
The head of the Algerian delegation, M. Hassani, passed on a message from the Director General of Algerian Police that they are very satisfied with the high quality training CEPOL offers.
Furthermore, Mr Schröder expressed his willingness during the meeting to create a closer cooperation in the future.
