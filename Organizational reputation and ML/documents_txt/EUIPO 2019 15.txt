Enhanced front office for Slovenia



The Slovenian Intellectual Property Office (), with the support of the EUIPO’s European Cooperation Projects, has upgraded its front office system.
The new software version, which went live on 29 November 2019, notably improves the efficiency, operational effectiveness, security and maintenance of SIPO’s front office system.
The improvements were carried out within the framework of the EUIPO’s  Projects. The projects aim to benefit users across the EU by providing modern, state-of-the-art tools and services for intellectual property offices.
Further cooperation with SIPO on projects such as the implementation of the Software Package Back Office and the transposition of the Trade Mark Directive are expected to be completed during 2020.
