​The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) has adopted a Decision on the proposal of all EU Transmission System Operators (TSOs) for the amendment to the determination of capacity calculation regions.

The proposal was initially submitted to all energy regulatory authorities, which could not reach an agreement. They subsequently referred the proposal to the Agency for a decision. The Agency's decision temporally assigns a new bidding zone border between the bidding zones of Denmark 1 and of the Netherlands to the Hansa capacity calculation region, but requires from TSOs to further analyse the optimal determination of the Hansa and Channel regions. The Agency also amended the determination of the Greece-Italy (GRIT) capacity calculation region in order to align it with the changes in the bidding zone borders resulting from the bidding zone review recently performed in Italy.
