​ACER publishes new REMIT Quarterly


The 15th edition of the Agency’s REMIT Quarterly has been published on the REMIT Portal. Covering the fourth quarter of 2018, it includes the Agency’s assessment of the operation of different categories of organised market places (OMPs) and ways of trading, and briefly outlines the results of a data quality analysis of the timeliness of reporting. 

The latest issue also elaborates on algorithmic trading in wholesale energy markets in the context of REMIT, summarises the meetings with stakeholders that took place in the last quarter of 2018, and provides information about the updates of REMIT documentation. In addition, two new validation rules for REMIT transaction reporting related to the reporting of delivery points or zones in Table 1 and Table 2 are explained, and an overview of Contingency Reports opened by Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs), as well as some general REMIT statistics for the last four quarters are presented.
