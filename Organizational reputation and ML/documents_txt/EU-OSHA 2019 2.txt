Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: prevalence, costs and demographics in the EU

Our new comprehensive European overview report and summary look at how MSDs affect the European workforce, society and economy.
These publications are part of a large-scale EU-OSHA project aimed at analysing national and European data on MSDs, their impact on health and work, risk factors, and prevention and return-to-work measures.
This in-depth analysis points to the need for an integrated approach to preventing work-related MSDs, which affect millions of workers and cost employers billions of euros. 
Some national reports will follow soon.
