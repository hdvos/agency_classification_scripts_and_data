â€‹The Agency has published today its Opinion on the implementation of the electricity investments in the European Union-wide electricity Ten-year Network Development Plan (EU TYNDP). The Agency found that 21% of the national investments encountered delays, most frequently due to permit granting reasons, and 26% have been rescheduled by the promoter over the past two years.

Moreover, the Agency found that around 25% of the interconnections were subject to a different investment status across the border. While this is not per se proof of an inconsistency in the implementation, it could point to limited cross-border coordination among the parties. Therefore, the Agency recommends to the promoters, Transmission System Operators and National Regulatory Authorities to review jointly the concerned interconnection investments and amend the respective implementation plans in case of inconsistency.
