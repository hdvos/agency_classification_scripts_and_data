Council of Europe expert group focuses on statelessness
Rights areas:


FRA attended and provided expert input to a Council of Europe ad-hoc expert meeting on statelessness.Â 

The meeting was organised under the supervision of the European Committee on Legal Co-operation (CDCJ).
The meeting brought together national experts and key stakeholders (e.g. international organisations, NGOs and academics) in Europe.
It carried out a preliminary review of protocols and procedures used by European countries to determine and resolve cases of statelessness, in particular of migrant children.
The main purpose of this exercise was to identify possible gaps and new challenges in this field and to consider ways in which the Council of Europe could best assist national authorities. CDCJ will decide on the next steps at its plenary meeting in November 2019.
The expert meeting took place from 11 to 12 June in Strasbourg.
