Frontex and OSCE come together to help fight document fraud in the Western Balkans
2019-09-12
Document fraud is a global challenge for border security, internal security and migration management. This is why experts from Frontex and the OSCE organised a conference in Vienna this week to talk about ways to prevent document fraud in the Western Balkans region.
The meeting brought together document experts from all around Europe, the European Commission, the European External Action Service, Europol, Interpol, IOM, as well as representatives from Western Balkan countries.
The participants discussed ways to coordinate activities to fight against document fraud and support relevant authorities with training aimed at detecting this criminal activity. This cooperation should go beyond law enforcement activities as it requires to establish a relationship with authorities issuing documents, as well as with international organisations, airlines, shipping companies and others.
Frontex has a key role when it comes to activities related to document fraud in the European Union. The agency’s Centre of Excellence for Combatting Document Fraud supports Member States and non-EU countries in combating document fraud and related cross-border crimes in Frontex operations at external borders, using its expertise to provide support and contribute to specific actions in field operations.
