1Oct2019
Dutch railway industry leaders signed the European Railway Safety Culture Declaration in Utrecht, committing to raise awareness and promote a positive safety culture throughout the entire industry. 

Organised by the Dutch National Safety Authority, Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT), today’s conference brought together the leaders of the Dutch railway sector in Utrecht to discuss safety and leadership.
Many leaders from the Dutch railway sector followed the call from Josef Doppelbauer, Executive Director of the EU Agency for Railways (ERA), and signed the European Railway Safety Culture Declaration, committing to raise awareness and to promote a positive safety culture throughout the entire industry.
A positive safety culture reinforces the effects of a Safety Management System, improving the capability and efficiency of safety management.
The EU Agency for Railways’ understanding of safety culture is: safety culture refers to the interaction between the requirements of the Safety Management System, how people make sense of them, based on their attitudes, values and beliefs and what they actually do, as seen in decisions and behaviours. A positive safety culture is characterised by a collective commitment by leaders and individuals to always act safely, in particular when confronted with competing goals.
The EU Agency for Railways has developed safety leadership training, supporting the role of leaders in delivering safe performance, which it can deliver on request.
