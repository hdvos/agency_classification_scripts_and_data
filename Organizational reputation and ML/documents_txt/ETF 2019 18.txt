Georgia to assess skills development in the country
30 OCT 2019
After the successful Skills4Jobs event, which took place on 29th October in Tbilisi, Georgia, the European Training Foundation is organising today a Torino Process Dissemination workshop to present the results of the new assessment.
Georgia participates in the Torino Process since 2010. The Torino Process is a participatory process leading to an evidence-based analysis of the vocational education and training policies in a country. Introduced in 2010 and carried out every two years, the Torino Process provides a snapshot of the state of development of vocational education systems in the EU neighbouring countries, an overview of progress made and priorities for the future. More specifically, the Torino Process is a vehicle for:
developing a common understanding of a medium-term vision, priorities and strategy for vocational education development, exploring possible options for implementing this vision and/or making further progress;
designing and evaluating home-grown and affordable vocational education policies, based on evidence or knowledge and collaboration;
updating the analyses and achievements at regular intervals;
providing opportunities for capacity development and policy learning within and among partner countries and with the EU;
empowering countries to better coordinate the contributions of donors to achieving agreed national priorities.
