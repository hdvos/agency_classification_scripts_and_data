EIGE's new website
EIGE has re-designed its website to make it clearer, more accessible, and friendlier to new and returning users. It is now easier to find the latest information on gender equality and use our many resources.

Key new features of the website include:

New topic pages that give an overview of gender equality in your area of work and provide links to all our resources. You can choose agriculture, energy or any of the other 20 topics available.
New country pages that let you pick your own country and easily see what relevant resources we have available
New project pages that present all of EIGE’s projects since we started working until today
A language menu that makes it easier to find translations of EIGE’s publications
These are just some of the features of the new website.

The revamp comes out of a 2017 evaluation study, which used interviews, surveys and web analytics to ask users what improvements they wanted to see. The website continues to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines developed by the WCAG Working Group in order to ensure accessibility for users with visual impairments.
