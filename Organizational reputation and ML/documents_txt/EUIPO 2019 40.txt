Cyprus upgrades online services for trade marks


The Cypriot Department of Registrar of Companies and Official Receiver (CY DRCOR), with the support of  the EUIPO’s European Cooperation Projects, has upgraded  its existing online services for trade marks.
The new e-filing solution for trade marks became available on 15 July, bringing improved e-filing and online services for trade marks to Cypriot users. The project has been carried out with the support of different teams from the EUIPO and DRCOR.
This new version also contains functions which, when released, will be compatible with the regulatory changes brought about by the transposition of EU Directive to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (Directive (EU) 2015/2436 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2015).
The implementation was carried out within the framework of the , in particular the project ‘ECP2 Major improvements to existing tools’, for which Cyprus was the first pilot office to implement this system (Front Office Release 2).
The overall aim of the projects is to benefit users across the EU by providing modern, state of the art tools and services for intellectual property offices in the European Union Intellectual Property Network (EUIPN).
