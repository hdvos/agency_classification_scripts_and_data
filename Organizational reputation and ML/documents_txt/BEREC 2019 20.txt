On 29 January BEREC held a public workshop to share and discuss the preparation of the guidelines on Intra-EU communication services. The workshop served as a platform for stakeholders to provide their input on the document, instead of the regular public consultation process - as this was not possible due to the short deadlines foreseen.

The event was organized in the framework of the amendments to Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, which introduce new EU rules on retail price caps for Intra-EU communications, fixed and mobile calls and SMS. The rules are due to apply as of 15 May 2019.

BEREC will draft guidelines with the aim to ensure a coherent application of the Regulation in EU countries. These guidelines will include general provisions, as well as specific rules where BEREC defines parameters to assess the sustainability of these provisions.

It is planned, that the BEREC guidelines on Intra-EU communication services will be approved during the plenary meeting in Budapest for publication on 13 March, 2019.
