H.E. KOULA SOPHIANOU, AMBASSADOR OF CYPRUS IN SPAIN, VISITS SATCEN
On 14 November 2019, H.E. Koula Sophianou, Ambassador of Cyprus in Spain, visited SatCen and was briefed on the Centre's activities.
She was welcomed by SatCen Director Amb. Sorin Ducaru and Deputy Director Giuseppe D’Amico and then introduced to other SatCen Managers. Amb. Ducaru gave an introduction to SatCen activities and governance, also covering the Centre’s strategic development perspective. Examples of product requests from Member States were related to migration, evacuation of citizens from a crisis area and situational awareness for the participation of a Member State in an EU operation.
Head of IT Alexis Letulier explained the importance of integration, customization and development of tools for the analysis of satellite imagery. Artificial intelligence eases the work of SatCen analysts by scanning huge areas to detect objects of iterests, so that the analysts can focus on the analysis itself and not waste unnecessary time on detection.
Thereafter, H.E. Koula Sophianou was led to the Operations Division where imagery analysts showed examples of SatCen products.
