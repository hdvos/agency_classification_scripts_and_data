Latvia: national forum on adult education developments

On 22 November 2019 stakeholders discussed the developments in adult education in the national forum ‘I work and learn’. Topics included among others: learning for employees at the workplace, involvement of employers in adult education, good practice examples in providing learning at the workplace, challenges and solutions for quality assurance in non-formal education.
An awarding ceremony was held during the forum for employers for good practice examples of ensuring training for their employees. The examples were gathered through a survey arranged by the Employers’ Confederation of Latvia in 2019; main results of the survey were presented at the event.
Prior to the forum, four regional discussions were organised to collect stakeholder views on planning and implementing adult education. The results of these regional events provided the basis for further debate in the forum. Main conclusions include: a need for a network of contact points at local government level providing basic information on adult education to potential learners; validation of prior learning outcomes and tax incentives for employers.
The conclusions will be used as a basis for the forthcoming adult education policy paper 2021-27.
The forum was organised as a closing event for the Erasmus+ project ‘National coordinators for the implementation of the European agenda for adult learning’ (2017-19) implemented by the Ministry of Education and Science.
