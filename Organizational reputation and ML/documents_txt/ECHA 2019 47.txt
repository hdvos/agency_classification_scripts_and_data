ECHA/NR/19/13
 
The Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis (SEAC) adopts its final opinion supporting the proposal to restrict hazardous chemicals in tattoo inks and permanent make-up. The Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) concludes on sixteen  opinions on harmonised classification and labelling.
 
Helsinki, 20 March 2019 – SEAC adopted its final opinion backing the proposal to restrict the placing on the market and use of hazardous substances in tattoo inks and permanent make-up, meaning both the Committees have agreed to support the restriction proposed by ECHA in collaboration with Denmark, Italy, and Norway. Substances within the scope of the restriction include carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic (CMR) substances, skin sensitisers or irritants, substances corrosive or damaging to the eye, metals as well as other substances regulated in cosmetic products.
Furthermore, RAC has adopted sixteen opinions for harmonised classification and labelling, including opinions on eleven active substances used in plant protection products and five industrial chemicals, including one adopted by written procedure prior to RAC 48.
Both Committees agreed that ECHA’s restriction proposals for intentionally added microplastic particles, for D4, D5 and D6 and for formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers in articles are all in conformity with the requirements of Annex XV of REACH. All proposals are checked for conformity before the committees can start their evaluation and develop opinions. A public consultation on these restriction proposals will be launched soon.
More information about the opinions is available in the annex.
