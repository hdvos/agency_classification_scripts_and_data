In order to obtain professional event management services, an open tender procedure will be published soon in the Official Journal of the EU and on the BEREC website.

The BEREC Office uses the specialized electronic edition of the Official Journal of the EU for procurement – TED e-Tendering, the BEREC website and social media, to ensure the transparency of its procurement procedures. TED eTendering is an EU institutions' eProcurement platform allowing free electronic access to call for tenders' documents such as contractual documentation, technical specifications, annexes, questions and answers etc., TED eTendering effectively represents an added-value extension to TED (Tenders Electronic Daily), the online version of the "Supplement to the Official Journal of the European Union".

e-Tendering is also used for the electronic exchange of information between the BEREC Office and the potential contractors, as well as for the electronic submission of documents in response to call for tenders. More details on the e-submission in the Quick Reference Guide.

After the official launch of the open tender procedure in the Official Journal of the EU the BEREC Office will expect offers of tenderers to be electronically submitted to the BEREC Office via e-tendering.

More information on the public procurement steps and presentations form the recent training on the EU procurement you can find on the dedicated webpage of the BEREC website.
