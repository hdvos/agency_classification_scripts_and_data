Brussels, 27 November 2019 
At its meeting of 25 November 2019, the ECSEL Joint Undertaking Public Authorities Board elected Mag. Doris Vierbauch (Austria) as their Chairperson. Ms. Vierbauch thereby also becomes a vice- chair of the Governing Board. The Public Authorities Board and the Governing Board, also on behalf of the entire ECSEL JU community, extended very warm thanks to the outgoing PAB Chair, Mr. Ben Ruck (Netherlands), whose high level of professionalism and drive have served the ECSEL JU community so well. 
“With ever increasing global competition for the European Electronic Components and Systems (ECS) Industry and the transfer form "Horizon 2020" to the new framework programme "Horizon Europe" very challenging times are lying ahead of us.” She states. “Within the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, the European Commission, Participating States and Industry join forces to strengthen EU's competitiveness and technological sovereignty. I have been part of this endeavour for more than 10 years and look forward to contributing in my new role to further develop a sustainable future for the key digital technologies in Europe. I also want to thank the Public Authorities Board for their trust”.
