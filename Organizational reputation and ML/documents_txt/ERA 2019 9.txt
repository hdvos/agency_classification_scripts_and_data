First 100 days of new processes at ERA have proven successful
24Sep2019
The European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) has successfully managed the first 100 days of new processes after the implementation of the new EU legislation (Fourth Railway Package). 

Since June 16th 2019 ERA is the European institution mandated to authorise vehicles that operate across borders in Europe, to issue single safety certificates which are valid in multiple European states, and to ensure an interoperable European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS).
“Today, after 100 days of intense activities at the Agency as authorising entity, we are proud that the new processes are running smoothly”, says Josef Doppelbauer, Executive Director of ERA. The success of the first 100 days is an endorsement of the preparatory work done by the Agency that included, cooperation agreements with National Safety Authorities, peer review with the Management Board, an extensive programme of learning cases and positive collaboration with the National Safety Authorities. The Management Board will continue to monitor the implementation period in 2020 through its subgroup, the 4th Railway Package steering group.
Today the situation is as follows: with regards to Vehicle Authorisation, the Agency has received 172 valid applications via the One-Stop Shop IT tool (OSS).
