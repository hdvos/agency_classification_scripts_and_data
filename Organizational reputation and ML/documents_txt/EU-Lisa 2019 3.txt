Estonian Parliament Delegation Visits eu-LISA Headquarters 
On 9 December 2019, we had the pleasure of hosting a delegation from the Estonian Parliament at our headquarters in Tallinn.

Over 20 members, part of the Constitutional Committee, the Legal Affairs Committee or the Security Authorities Surveillance Select Committee, attended the meeting. 

Following a brief introduction, Executive Director Krum Garkov outlined the Agency's new mandate and the state-of-play on the operational management of existing large-scale IT systems (SIS II, VIS, Eurodac), the development of new systems (EES, ETIAS, ECRIS-TCN), as well as interoperability of EU information systems in the Justice and Home Affairs area.

Other topics on the agenda included business continuity and security assurance of the IT systems, and the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027.
