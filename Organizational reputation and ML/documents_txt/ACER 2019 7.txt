​The implementation of the Network Code on Requirements for Generators is well on track in the majority of Member States, according to the latest Implementation Monitoring Report on the matter published today by the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).

Two main aspects were monitored, the formal approval of the determination of significance for generating units – which is defined based on their size and the voltage level of the connection point - and the establishment of requirements for general application, a set of parameters whose value is defined at national level.  The Agency, however found the formal approval of both could not be confirmed in a few Member States yet.

In the report, ACER recommends:

A prompt implementation of the determination of significance and the requirements of general application in Bulgaria, Spain, France, Great Britain and Greece. Also, the implementation needs to be completed in the Netherlands, as only part of the non-exhaustive requirements are currently approved.
In relation to the above, the Agency recommends that relevant National Regulatory Authorities complete (where they are empowered to do so) or promote expeditious implementation of the Network Code on Requirements for Generators and inform ACER upon its full implementation.
