SATCEN DEPUTY DIRECTOR GIUSEPPE D'AMICO SPEAKS AT THE FIRST SPACE CONGRESS IN MADRID
On 10 October, the first Space Congress in Madrid took place. SatCen Deputy Director Giuseppe D'Amico spoke during the panel “The Future of Space”. He talked about the Centre's role as security provider from and in space and the importance of EU Space Surveillance and Tracking services.
He explained how space debris and the way it affects the space environment needs to be considered in all phases of the life of a satellite, starting with the design phase, where the materials used should be such that they disintegrate once the satellite re-enters.
“Space today should be communicated for what it is: a service-enabler and a common place ruled by international agreements”, Mr. D’Amico said. “We should aim at reaching a point when European citizens dream of European space.”
