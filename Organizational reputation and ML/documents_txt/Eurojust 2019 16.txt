Now open: latest call for applications for financial assistance to JITs
09/01/2019
As part of Eurojust’s mission to stimulate and improve the coordination of investigations and prosecutions in cross-border criminal cases, the latest call for proposals for financial assistance to joint investigation teams (JITs) is now open. JITs are a key instrument of judicial cooperation that Eurojust supports to allow national judicial and law enforcement authoritiesto work together as one team. By making these grants available to JITs, Eurojust financially supports activities such as JITs’ meetings; investigative measures carried out in the territory of another State; interpretation and translation of various kinds of documents; and transnational transfer of seized items, evidentiary material, etc. The eligible costs that may be covered include travel and accommodation, interpretation and translation as well as transport costs.
Eurojust also offers logistic support to JITs by lending equipment such as mobile telephones, including communication costs, laptops, as well as mobile scanners and printers, for the duration of the JIT and its possible extensions.
For the period between 16 February 2019 and 15 May 2019, Eurojust will have an amount of up to € 350 000 available for JITs financing. The objective is to finance only the JIT costs that arise from the cross-border dimension of the investigation. To guarantee a reasonable distribution among the various JITs, a ceiling of € 50 000 has been set for each application.
