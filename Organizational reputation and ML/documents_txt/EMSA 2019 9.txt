Cooperation to raise cybersecurity awareness across transport modes
The first European Conference on Transport Cybersecurity was held today in EMSA’s premises in Lisbon, gathering 170 representatives from across the various transport modes. The conference was organised by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) in close cooperation with the European Commission (DG MOVE), the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the EU Agency for Railways (ERA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA).
The conference gave participants from both the public and private sphere the opportunity to look at cybersecurity from a multifaceted and multimodal perspective. They discussed the legal framework in place for cybersecurity at EU level and its relevance for the transport sector, as well as the need for cooperation in the future. “In this increasingly digital age, we face borderless cybersecurity risks and we must take a borderless response to our cooperation across all transport modes,” said Maja Markovčić Kostelac, EMSA’s Executive Director.
