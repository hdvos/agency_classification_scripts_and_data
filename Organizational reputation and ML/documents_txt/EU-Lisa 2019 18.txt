Register Now - Industry Roundtable 17 October 2019 
On 17 October 2019, eu-LISA will host its 11th  industry roundtable event in Tallinn, Estonia.
Titled "Towards Practical Implementation of the New JHA Information Architecture", the event will follow the eu-LISA Annual Conference and will take the topic of the new JHA information architecture forward in a more practical way.
eu-LISA has recently completed a feasibility study that maps out the desired future interoperability architecture - a game-changing structure, fully aligned with legal, functional and technical requirements, that aims to support the increasing needs of border management, internal security and migration management transformation. Industry representatives are invited to respond practically and propose solutions for the architectural design and development of future large-scale IT systems. 
Information on the agenda, the venue and the registration form as well as on how to participate is available on our dedicated website: 
We look forward to your participation.
