SAFE 360˚ is an innovative conference which strives to break down silos by examining key safety issues through a cross-domain perspective in an interactive environment. The conference abides by the Chatham House Rule, which allows its participants to talk freely without judgement.

The upcoming SAFE 360˚ will focus on drawing more links with the EASA Safety Risk Management process and on the growing importance of big data in augmenting safety intelligence. The key takeaways from the next edition will contribute directly to the analysis of safety issues, refining our Safety Risk Portfolios and potentially, the European Plan for Aviation Safety (EPAS).

It will also be the first conference in Europe to showcase the link between the wider aviation safety communities and the D4S (big) data-driven safety intelligence.
