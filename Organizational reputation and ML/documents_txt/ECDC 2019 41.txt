The HEPSA (Health Emergency Preparedness Self-Assessment) tool that ECDC launched in 2018 in English is now available in all EU/EEA languages. This tool aims at supporting countries in improving their level of public health emergency preparedness.
The HEPSA tool consists of a user guide and a self-assessment tool, and the translated versions of these two materials will facilitate the use at country level. This tool helps in the evaluation of the levels of preparedness and contributes to identification of potential gaps. It also facilitates interactions among stakeholders to discuss themes related to public health emergency preparedness. Based on the outcomes of the self-assessment, areas for improvement can be identified and actions can be taken by the countries in order to strengthen capacities.
The HEPSA tool is worksheet-based and is targeted at professionals in public health organisations responsible for emergency planning and event management. It consists of seven domains that define the process of public health emergency preparedness and response:
Pre-event preparations and governance;
Resources: Trained workforce;
Support capacity: Surveillance;
Support capacity: Risk assessment;
Event response management;
Post-event review;
Implementation of lessons learned.
