ECHA/NR/19/45
The Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (SEAC) adopted its opinion on the restriction proposal on N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) adopted its opinion on the restriction proposal on siloxanes (D4, D5, D6). 
Helsinki, 10 December 2019 – SEAC adopted its final opinion on the restriction proposal by Italy to restrict the uses of the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) on its own or in mixtures in a concentration equal to or greater than 0.3 % w/w.
RAC and SEAC supported the proposal by ECHA to restrict placing on the market of D4, D5 and D6 as substances, as contituents of other substances, or in mixtures in a concentration equal to or greater than 0.1 % w/w of each substance. A consultation on the agreed SEAC opinion will begin soon and the Committee is expected to adopt an opinion at its March 2020 meeting.
RAC has adopted 10 opinions on harmonised classification and labelling, including opinions on eight active substances used in biocidal products and/or plant protection products and two industrial chemicals.
RAC agreed on 14 draft opinions on authorisation applications for uses of chromium (VI) substances and octyl- and nonylphenol ethoxylates. SEAC agreed on 25 draft opinions on uses of chromium trioxide, coal tar pitch, high temperature, anthracene oil and octyl- and nonylphenol ethoxylates. Furthermore, RAC and SEAC discussed key issues in 17 applications for authorisation, which were received by ECHA in August 2019. More information about the opinions is available in the annex.
