Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published its updated Risk Dashboard based on the fourth quarter 2018 Solvency II data.
The results show that the risk exposures of the European Union insurance sector remain overall stable.
Macro risks continue at medium level. Low swap rates and recent downward revisions to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and inflation forecasts remain a concern going forward. Credit and market risks remain at medium level amid slightly decreased bond spreads, stable portfolio exposures and broadly unchanged bond volatility. Profitability and solvency risks are stable, with overall unchanged profitability indicators compared to the second half of 2018 and end-2017. Median Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) ratios are well above 100% for groups, life and non-life solo undertakings. Insurance risks increased to medium level due to a further increase in the catastrophe loss ratio. Market perceptions remain stable at medium level with insurance stocks slightly outperforming the overall market, a reduction in insurance groups' Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads and unchanged external ratings.
