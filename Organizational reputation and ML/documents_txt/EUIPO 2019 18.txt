Enhanced back office for Lithuania



 
The State Patent Bureau of the Republic of Lithuania (), with the support of the EUIPO’s European Cooperation Projects, has upgraded its back office system.
The upgrade, which took place on 15 November 2019, is designed to increase the efficiency, operational effectiveness and security of the back office system used at SPB, as well as to make maintenance easier.
The back office tool, developed by the EUIPO’s  activities, helps in the management of tasks related to the examination and registration of trade marks and designs, and follows the successful front office upgrade completed earlier in 2019.
The improvements were carried out within the framework of the European Cooperation projects, the main goal of which is to provide modern, state-of the art tools and services for IP offices, thus benefiting users across the EU.
