An overview of data pseudonymisation
ENISA today publishes a new report, which discusses the notion of pseudonymisation and its role under the . To this end, specific techniques that may be utilised for pseudonymisation are presented together with relevant best practices, with a focus on the area of mobile applications.
Exploring the notion of data protection by default
The principle of “data protection first”, as promoted by GDPR when it comes to data protection by default, has neither been the standard behaviour of products, services and applications nor a regular principle in software design methods. This report aims to shed some light on what the data-protection-by-default principle means in information technology design, what is the situation today, as well as how this new obligation could support controllers in selecting data-protection-friendly defaults.
Sketching the notion of “state-of-the-art” for security of personal data processing
Under GDPR, security of personal data is one of the main elements of controllers’ accountability. As such, it requires an engineered approach capable of striking a balance between security goals, costs and “state-of-the-art” solutions. To this end, ENISA, following past years’ work on the security of personal data processing for SMEs, publishes a new report, which discusses well-established security practices in a number of categories of security measures.
