Cedefop received a group of 75 young people and youth workers representing Cyprus, Greece, Hungary and Turkey on 2 May. The group consisted of blind, visually impaired and sighted youngsters.
They travelled to Thessaloniki in the framework of an Erasmus+ Youth/Youth and Lifelong Learning Foundation project run by the Youthorama NGO, which is based in Thessaloniki’s Pilea/Hortiatis Municipality. The project’s coordinator is Elias Mastoras, a youth trainer working with blind and visually impaired people for many years.
The purpose of the visit was to get hands-on experience of the Europass CV for blind and visually impaired. Cedefop Head of Department for VET Systems and Institutions Loukas Zahilas welcomed the visitors. Cedefop expert Philippe Tissot presented, with the support of Stavros Ladas, the Europass CV and the accessible CV editor developed for blind and visually impaired users.
