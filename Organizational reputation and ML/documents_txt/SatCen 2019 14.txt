THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR HUMANITARIAN AID AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT VISITS SATCEN
On 9 July 2019, Mr Christos Stylianides, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Mr Fernando Grande-Marlaska, Spanish Minister for Home Affairs, and Mr Luis Planas, Spanish Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, visited SatCen.
They were welcomed by SatCen Director Amb Sorin Ducaru and Deputy Director Giuseppe D'Amico. Head of SatCen Operations Adriano Baptista gave an overview on SatCen activities with special focus on Copernicus - the European Union’s Earth Observation Programme. SatCen is implementing the Copernicus Service in Support to EU External Action. Examples of this service are support to humanitarian aid and crisis management activities and support to EU missions and operations and international organisations. The specific examples described in detail for each type of support were the Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, support to the EU Training Mission in Mali and support to UN MINURSO in Western Sahara. In the Operations Division, imagery analysts explained how SatCen supports Frontex by monitoring illegal migration, and how it uses artificial intelligence to help the European Fisheries Control Agency detect illegal tuna farming in the Mediterranean Sea.
‘Here I felt very proud as European citizen, not only as European Commissioner. It is a perfect example of EU added value. Special congratulations to the whole staff. Excellent job', said Mr Christos Stylianides.
