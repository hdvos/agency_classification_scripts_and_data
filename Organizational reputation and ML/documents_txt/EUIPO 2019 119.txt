Consultation on CP10 – Criteria for assessing disclosure of designs on the Internet


The draft Common Practice of the project  has been made available for comments.
The CP10 Working Group, composed of representatives from EU intellectual property offices, User Associations, the European Patent Office (EPO) and the EUIPO, made significant progress on developing the Common Practice during the Working Group meetings and a workshop held in December 2018. Best practices and expertise were shared among the Working Group members to establish the common principles of the CP10 project.
 
As a result, the first draft of the Common Practice is now available in English for review and suggestions.
The EUIPO welcomes your comments, which should be addressed to by Wednesday, 8 May 2019.
The CP10 project is part of the European Cooperation Projects under the heading ECP4 Shared Services and Practices.
