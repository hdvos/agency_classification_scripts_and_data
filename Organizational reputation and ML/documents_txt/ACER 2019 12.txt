ACER to decide on the methodology for coordinated redispatching and countertrading for Bulgaria, Greece and Romania

The National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) for energy of Bulgaria, Greece and Romania have recently referred to the Agency the proposal of the Electricity Transmission System Operators (TSOs) of the South East Europe Capacity Calculation Region (SEE CCR) for developing the methodology for Coordinated Redispatching and Countertrading as mandated by the EU Regulation establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management. The Agency will take a Decision on the proposal by 11 August 2019.

Redispatching and countertrading are actions by which TSOs request network users or market participants to adjust their scheduled transactions in order to avoid physical congestion in the network.

The Agency will launch the related public consultation soon.
