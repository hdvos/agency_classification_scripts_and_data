27 September 2019
CEPOL's Executive Director, Dr. h. c. Detlef Schröder and Head of the Training Unit, Agnieszka Biegaj, met today in Warsaw with the Comender in Chief of Polish Police, Gen. Jarosław Szymczyk, followed by a joint working session with the Executive Director of FRONTEX, Fabrice Leggeri.
During the first meeting at the General Police Headquarters, CEPOL officials have been joined by the representative of the Polish Ministry of Interior and Administration, the Police Academy in Szczytno, and the other Police Academies.
The Polish Police actively participates in CEPOL training activities and is a member of the CEPOL Knowledge Centre on CSDP missions.
The main topics of discussion today were how to further improve our cooperation and Poland's possible future involvement in CEPOL's capacity building projects in the Eastern Partnership countries.
The Polish side emphasised the attractiveness of CEPOL's full training offer, which enables active participation of Polish law enforcement.
CEPOL has been especially praised for its efforts to upgrade the IT-related capacities of the EU law enforcement officials. The Agency's online products, such as online courses and webinars, received acclaim too, as they allow for higher participation rates.
The afternoon a working session with the Frontex Executive Director, Fabrice Leggeri, concerned strengthening of the inter-agency cooperation in different areas, especially regarding CEPOL's plans to engage more actively in the capacity building projects for law enforcement in third countries, with particular attention to the EU's frontiers and its closest neighbourhood.
